We must change the way we act and react. Our behavior there fuels the fires of our trauma, so to speak. Except instead of staying warm we just end up immolating ourselves and it&#039;s most certainly not a blaze of glory. It&#039;s just foolishness. We need to extinguish, not feed. Feeding feels cathartic, but we must understand that it&#039;s a fleeting catharsis. It&#039;s healing is only momentarily so. For something lasting we need the kind of change that lasts.

Eventually she told her mother about me and her mother empathically disapproved as I wasnt the sequel to the (to her parents generation) the mythical rich white boomer. She followed her mothers order accordingly and demanded me not to contact her (she is still not married). Next, a Vietnamese girl she was great apart from contacting her ex boyfriend. Her mum walked out on her and her dad twice when she was a child. Despite that her mum convinced her to press me for marriage and even tried to coerce me. Following her mum&#039;s orders she left, got into a relationship with an older guy after a month and got married six months later. Her mum had plans to come to Australia. I can tell you three more examples (Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian).

If this means something to you, then get serious about it. There\u2019s a mental state where you will succeed at quitting, but you have to care enough to stay conscious and keep yourself in this state. You\u2019re letting yourself drift into not caring about it. And just to let you know, even after I discovered that fact for myself, I still wasted another full year getting serious. <br><br>Don\u2019t hide from anything you feel. Learn to relax with it, and to maintain your true will. And understand that you need to be 100 times more serious about it. You can FEEL when things start to slide, but I guarantee you just put on a video game or youtube video and pretend you\u2019ve got this. These emotions are going to entice you to do it, and you have to learn to get yourself away from that.

That feeling is good.

I don&#039;t know how you were raised... but the sheer amount of sex going on in college - public or private - is probably the most frequent sex in most people&#039;s entire lives. After college all sorts of shit gets in the way. So even though every girl in college swears up and down she&#039;s not fucking people... she 100% is fucking people. I&#039;ll spare you the endless stories of how I know. Just please understand that women lie, they lie about how much sex they&#039;re having, and college girls lie their asses of about it. So this girl was probably fucking other men before and during dating you.<br><br>In addition, making out a ton without you escalating it to fucking (even if she says no) sends the signal you&#039;re either a practicing religious boy or gay. That&#039;s not the case - I know that a lot of us men don&#039;t know wtf we&#039;re doing and have feelings too - but women are pretty fucking dumb man when it comes to men. And in this era where attention is just an Instagram DM or TikTok away.... women *expect* men to try to fuck them. So if you take it slow you&#039;re either &quot;gay&quot; (to preserve the woman&#039;s image of herself as hot, &quot;like omg it&#039;s not me he&#039;s just gay teehee&quot;) OR you&#039;re &quot;religious/inexperience/a virgin.&quot; It&#039;s stupid as hell but why do you think there are so many sad and lonely women past 35? They act dumb as fuck for two decades and then wonder wtf happened.<br><br>Third, the girl is going hot / cold on you.

Either way, it&#039;s an issue. You need to hammer that out with her. Be blunt.<br><br>The topic of her weight sounds like an insecurity issue. Clearly you are interested in this girl. She probably doesn&#039;t feel like she is good enough for you, because of her appearance. Sadly, that&#039;s pretty common. But if she can&#039;t shake that feeling, it&#039;s gonna permeate into the rest of the relationship. This is a tricky topic to navigate tactfully, but I think it&#039;s important to be tactful and supportive, without lying. If she&#039;s too fat, tell her. But be supportive and encouraging, and remind her of her attractive qualities, too. If you are worried about her self-esteem, talk to her about it. Try to encourage her to make positive changes in life, but remind her to do it for HER - not YOU.<br><br>It&#039;s good that you guys still talk about personal stuff and talk frequently. But I want to know - do you guys have fun together? Do you play/joke together, and enjoy one another&#039;s company? I ask because it sounds like you guys don&#039;t really...enjoy each other?

To refuse to adapt.

Aversion training &amp; operand conditioning. It sounds dumb, but I do believe that I&#039;m not a &quot;true&quot; pedo/lolicon but rather one that has been conditioned to like it through my taboo inclination. There are several suggested approaches I&#039;ve seen. For example, you could try hurting yourself while jacking to it, though depending on your cooming level this may give you another fetish. Or jack to normal porn, once you cum switch to loli porn and keep jacking. This should make you uncomfortable, but if you get aroused again switch back to normal porn.<br>3. Getting a life (hard). I feel like it&#039;s much easier to become a sexual deviant if you don&#039;t have much going on. Get busy, and get a girlfriend.<br><br>I have a lot of hope for the conditioning approach.

I kinda feel like the job has nothing more to offer me anymore, I feel like I\u2019ve reached the top there and there\u2019s not much else to learn on the current position.

I hope this is one of your lifelong passions you can pursue to mastery.<br><br>It sounds like your issue is lack of clear, defined direction, and you haven&#039;t properly created long-term goals or how to obtain them. You need to get organized. Sometimes your environment can play into this; maybe there&#039;s many distractions at home, maybe it&#039;s messy, so start there if so. Next, sit down and take time, as much as you need, to consider where you want to be in 1 year, then 5, then 10, and so on. Figure out the ideal future for you at these milestones, whether it&#039;s to have a new job with more room to grow in 1 year, or to own your own home in 10, and clearly define where you think you would like to be. Then, take apart these larger goals into all of the small things you need to accomplish to get there, what you need to do to do the things you want to do, then, what you can do today to do those things. Break it all down to the smalles level until you have what is essentially a &quot;chore&quot; list that you perform daily towards your future improvement. If it&#039;s weight loss for example, in 1 year you want to lose 50 lbs, weekly you want to lose 1 pound, figure your caloric/nutritional budget daily, then your daily needed deficit to accomplish it, then every day you work on that. In a year&#039;s time, maybe you only lose 49 lbs, maybe you lose less, but by the very act of setting out to accomplish something, you&#039;re almost guaranteed to be closer to your goal than not. Don&#039;t let perfect be the enemy of good. Just keep trying, keep your goals clear and stick to your daily commitment to yourself. This is how all problems are handled, and all large goals are accomplished. Dream of the bigger picture, organize how to get there, and break it down into what you can do every day to move closer to it. If you do this, buddy, you can go anywhere you want in life.

I know &quot;simply&quot; isn&#039;t fair to say about what is often very hard to do, but it really is simple despite being hard. All a habit is is time+consistency. The more you do something, the longer you do it, the less active effort or motivation it takes to keep up with it, until it becomes as natural as anything you do every day, and eventually becomes a part of your way of life. It doesn&#039;t stay hard. You don&#039;t have to worry about perfect. If you start a diet, some days you will cheat, some days you will eat over your limit, no matter what you do occasional failures should be expected, and are not a bad thing. The important thing is to do *something*, anything, if even a small step, and work past the stumbles and setbacks. So long as you are facing forward, it doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re crawling, you will get there eventually. Time will pass regardless, in 5 years 5 years will have passed whether you pass it doing nothing or having accomplished what you set out to, you may as well give it a try, even if you&#039;re crawling there. Crawling will lead to walking, and, if you keep going, eventually you&#039;ll be marathon-running through your goals.

To me, setting goals is not really about discipline or at least not in the pragmatic sense. I see it more as a means for measure or description of a setting. In a way it is more of a depiction of something that is objective but it obviously can have a meritocratic usage to say a person has passed/failed something which probably isn&#039;t good for you if you have a underachiever complex.<br><br>But if you play with it poetically, i.e goals to be an objective future. You set your objective future... Being objective of the future. Heading towards a future in an objective way... I think you get the point. You don&#039;t need to worry about the meritocratic implications so much.<br><br>So when thinking about discipline in comparison, that is more of an expectation/prescription for when certain actions should be repeated or sustained I think.

So your small goals today are to apply for jobs. Once you have one, your goal then is to save to the $5,000. That&#039;s $1,000 a year over the next 5, so monthly you want to be saving $83, weekly only $20 basically. We just took that significant goal of having $5,000 and turned it into a stupidly easy goal on putting up $20 a week, the only hard part is disciplining yourself not to touch that money once it builds up.

It&#039;s objectively wrong to say they&#039;re not a relationship. In fact I&#039;d go as far as to argue they&#039;ve got a higher chance of success for slower-paced, shyer and more introverted people because they have less pressure and can take things at a more comfortable pace.<br><br>As for suggestions, it depends on the type of people you are. If you&#039;re open and curious then you can&#039;t go wrong by asking a lot of deep questions about your future hopes, what you&#039;re attracted to etc. Not only does that make for a ton of conversation but it&#039;ll allow you to connect on a deeper level, especially if you really engage back and forth with your thoughts (as opposed to something like &quot;that&#039;s interesting, I agree&quot;). If you can&#039;t think of ideas, then tests and quizes can help (for example MBTI - even if you don&#039;t believe it&#039;s accurate then it can still be used as a jumping off point for conversation as you discuss the similarities and differences in your results)<br><br>If you&#039;re not that way inclined though, it&#039;s good to watch movies online together, particularly romantic ones. There&#039;s a lot of websites that let you talk and stream at the same time such as cytube and free4talk. Games are another obvious thing, even if you&#039;re not the gaming sort then you can just treat it as a virtual space to talk in and go on virtual dates, such as exploring VRchat worlds together. If you&#039;re from different countries then make an effort to get to know each other&#039;s cultures.", "time": 1672106484, "resto": 27988019}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 27990558, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)20:03:59", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "dancing classes", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt; 28 yo</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; picked up mma few years ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; feel like i might be good at it on my current fitness and feel like id enjoy it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; wanna do it to build confidence with women as well</span><br>Anons? recommend? no go? experiences?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; pic rel</span>", "filename": "1652066374623", "ext": ".gif", "w": 720, "h": 960, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672103039127584, "time": 1672103039, "md5": "/kb+IABMvvYN//CcO6Om3g==", "fsize": 2877167, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dancing-classes", "replies": 4, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 27990574, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)20:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "thought you were talking about MMA the whole time.
