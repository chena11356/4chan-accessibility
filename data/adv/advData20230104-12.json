However, I believe even you can learn the rating system so simple it is. <br><br>First and foremost, the rating system is an OBJECTIVE measure of symmetry and ethnicity/gender related facial traits &amp; body shape. It has nothing to do with your SUBJECTIVE feelings of attraction nor how they compare to others you have seen. The rating system works equally across genders. <br><br>Secondly, there are ZERO people on the planet at either 1/10 or 10/10. They are conceptual extremes to give the scale context, they can not exist in nature. A 10/10 is someone whom is a 1:1 symmetrical person with an absolute perfect expression of their ethnicity appropriate features. A 10/10 would be quite literally perfect, but perhaps more importantly they&#039;d be weird to look at for any length of time. It&#039;s an objective assessment of genetic superiority, not a subjective comparison of compatibility with your own. <br><br>9/10 is the highest any real person can ever be. These are very rare, and even more rarely seen in public. As an example George Clooney has a facial symmetry of 94.2% scrapping him in just bearly as a 9/10. 9/10s with higher symmetry tend to be elusive, they don&#039;t have an easy life. <br><br>Brat Pitt on the other hand has a facial symmetry of 90.5% making him an 8/10. Essentially all 8/10s work in promotions of some kind and at an elite level, be it modelling, acting, music, whatever. <br><br>Andrew Tate has a facial symmetry of below 70% making him a 6/10. <br><br>Another less technical way to look at it for quick reference for your average, everyday experience is this. The average person is a 5/10. A degree more attractive than the average is a 6/10. A degree above them a 7/10 and so forth. A degree lower is a 4/10, a degree below that a 3/10 and so forth. Each degree is an exponential step in symmetry up or down.

I too have a very high tolerance to mind altering substances. I can take 8 Valium and hardly feel a thing. It\u2019s supposed to be a dangerous dose not recommended for anyone but it just doesn\u2019t affect me. <br>I was severely abused as a teenager and I think that changed my brain chemistry somehow so I have a very high tolerance for physical and emotional pain and chemical substances. Just my theory. <br>Unfortunately it also means I can take drug use to extremes and get blind drunk but not fall over/pass out. Also it means that when I do self-destructive behaviour it is extreme - otherwise it doesn\u2019t scratch that itch for me. These are very very bad outcomes. <br>What works is firstly realising that I cannot or rather do not want to do anything in moderation and that is unhealthy. I want control and knowledge of whatever situation me and my loved ones are in. Again, not good, but needs to be understood. I understand i will default to self-sabotage in relationships, health and finances. This took me decades to work out. <br>So the answer is to channel my extreme nature into fitness and discipline and realise that there are things beyond my control and to let go of trying to influence those things. This includes other people and the world around me. <br>Turn to Christ. Wear yourself out with physical activity.

I live in a big city so lots of opportunity to score with some random hoe. I was already buzzed as I went wandering into the outdoor park event that had live music and booze booths, but as I parked a spot on the lawn, a lovely little thing (6/10) started chatting me up. She had cute dimples, nice C cups, and a curvy waist. Maybe it was my indifferent blithe toward the whole celebration or the fact that I didn&#039;t think she was hot shit but we got talking. Then her friends swooped in and dragged her away. Oh well. Well 30 minutes after midnight, where everyone&#039;s hugging and kissing and throwing up on one another, the lovely little lady either serendipitously bumped into me or perhaps she staged the whole thing, but she embraced me warmly. She was plastered and I&#039;m almost positive she was on some sort of kicker combo, maybe ketamine and E, but yeah she seemed to take a liking to me and wasn&#039;t afraid to admit it. She started sticking her wet, pink tongue down my throat. She was good kisser, albeit a little sloppy and was groping my crotch quite openly in front of all sorts of drunk assholes, including her friends close by.

We kept the foreplay going leading into my bedroom, her fumbling to take her clothes off, me wondering where I could find a condom in my mess of a room. Then it happened. It was almost instantaneous like a lightning bolt. She moaned and groaned for it and was getting deranged. I, naked and in position to mount her, became confused. She stood up on my bed and told me to lay down in a demanding tone. I did as she said. Maybe she&#039;d reverse cowgirl it, I didn&#039;t question in that very moment. Well next thing I know she plops her round little behind right on my face, almost suffocating me. She grabs my hair and tells me to lick, so I begin licking her pussy. She grabs my hair tighter and groans impatiently. &quot;Not that, get your tongue up my ass,&quot; I could see the brown shaded, wrinkled hole right above my nose. I hesitated, almost shuddering at the idea of it. She moans more, as my withholding is driving her crazy. The weight of her ass on my face starts to become unbearable, so I stick my tongue out and try one lick of her ass. It&#039;s not what I expect and I tell her to get off me.
