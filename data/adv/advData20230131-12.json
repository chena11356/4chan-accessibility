Expecting that a woman be a virgin (because unless something horrible happened in her life, an unmarried woman who shares the values behind waiting until marriage wouldn&#039;t have had sex) before considering her as a partner is entirely different from wanting a woman BECAUSE she is a virgin. The former is a standard that only puts boundaries on one&#039;s search for a partner--it doesn&#039;t define the kind of person one hopes to find within those bounds.<br><br>The exact same reasoning applies to what you said in your first post. It&#039;s perfectly reasonable for a woman to expect financial stability from a man before considering him any further.

a fair place to start.<br><br>So don&#039;t focus too much on what you&#039;ve wasted or what you&#039;ve done wrong or even what you&#039;ve done right up to this point.<br><br>Rather understand that through the power of doing good deeds, mindfulness, and a willingness to let go of your attachment to certain things in your life you can totally transform the state of your mind and the overall state of your life 100%.<br><br>Start by prioritizing to do good deeds more and more, to do acts of generosity, to be a good person.<br><br>So start to prioritize that and look deeply at that<br><br>Once you start to make that a priority you can notice those things in your life that might feel good but ultimately or not skillful that means they don&#039;t nourish you they don&#039;t feed you on your

If they do something that you find wrong/inappropriate, then you have to be willing to walk out over that. Boundaries are very useful here because you don&#039;t need to stress over the truth of a messy situation (for example, a guy who went to a strip club but who insists &quot;my friend dragged me there, I didn&#039;t do anything&quot;), because getting into the situation itself is what crossed the boundary. Again, this is because good boundaries, either when you&#039;re following them yourself or holding others accountable by them, demand not only the right behavior but the appearance of doing the right thing.

Another important factor is studying, it doesn&#039;t really matter what, it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s for university, school or for yourself, you have to do it to keep your mind occupied with something productive.

It is also very silly to think about issues such as superiority or inferiority, we are all human, we all have problems and difficulties in life, of course there are degrees of this, but this does not have to be a limitation. You have to focus on yourself, on your problems, on your virtues, on your life, and not on that of others.<br><br>Another issue is guilt and remorse, which depending on the person can be the easiest part, or difficult to overcome, because it is easy to forgive others, but sometimes it is difficult, if not impossible, to forgive yourself. No matter how dirty your hands are, they can always be cleaned. You have to accept your sins, accept what you did wrong and live with it. Go to a priest, a psychologist, or tell someone you trust what you did, this can help, it doesn&#039;t matter if you think psychology is a joke, or if you don&#039;t believe in God, the important thing is to somehow get the weight off What are you wearing.", "filename": "b3d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 657, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1674863961876206, "time": 1674863961, "md5": "/ckkLToCRMe9uKIXDVDZTA==", "fsize": 38305, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-this-thread-we-are-going-to-look-for-the-cure", "replies": 108, "images": 16, "unique_ips": 50, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 28216874, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)18:59:55", "name": "OP", "com": "My least favorite part of this thread is going to a psychiatrist and being prescribed medication, which in itself sucks.

This loneliness is too much but no one wants to stick by my side for whatever fucking reason, hell i havent even seen another human being in the past week or so.

Without this, people will doubt themselves and have low confidence. Sometimes validation can be internal, but that requires an unusually strong moral foundation and a lot of willpower. Most people will seek this through social interactions. I honestly believe that being romantically valued is vital to a persons mental health - you are being judged by another person and found worthy of their commitment and attention. Social media is being used as a replacement for IRL validation, and we all see how that&#039;s going. <br><br>The requirement for social support is a phycological need to know that you have a safety net (social, emotional and physical) in case something goes wrong that you can&#039;t handle on your own. If you don&#039;t have this support you&#039;ll be subconsciously aware of your own vulnerability to disasters, like medical emergencies or times of hardship. Humans are pack animals, and knowing that you have a &quot;tribe&quot; that has your back is a very primal need for us. The state to some extent has fulfilled the &quot;physical&quot; aspect, but not the emotional or social. <br><br>In my experience both personal and from observing others, these two needs are absolute and cannot be replaced.

The whole natural order of things are being violated by kikes and that is why you came down to your conclusion inside your post. There are still pockets of communities that practice the natural order in regards to mating. They are propagating large families and they are multiplying at gradual but noticeable rates. Marriage is a contract being formed for a household being established. Households are like businesses, they need contracts. When you deny marriage, you deny yourself a household and when you deny a household; then you will become old and alone teetering on the brink of homelessness. Wake up guys, you&#039;re being lied to. This is a slow decay on our countries and peoples in the long run - you can still survive its consequences though. You do this by completely rejecting the kike proposed mating model and mold yourself in embracing natural model which is 2 people coming together to establish a household and birthing a liter of children. When the children grow older, they will establish their own households. Multiple families means many routes of passive incomes which is a better safety net than what the government provides you.

I&#039;m seriously thinking about ending it all or going ER. I don&#039;t know what to do anymore. although I&#039;m young most doors are closed for me. I failed summer school this year. my mom is threatening to kick me out claiming I&#039;m leeching off of her but she doesn&#039;t do shit. most of the money she gets is from my father who&#039;s on disability. he got brain damaged at 47. so he&#039;s getting money from the government because he got to retire early. my sister constantly tells me I&#039;m useless, and my mother tells me constantly I&#039;m a leech. she isolated me from other kids when I was younger but I managed to get some good friends in middle school by sheer luck of occasion.

I got to know her because she bumped into the group of me and my friends being nerdy about the current hot topic of the time. (Yandere Simulator) and she also seemed eager to discuss about it. she was nerdy but also hot. I know it&#039;s wrong to still lust for a Idealized version of a 13 year old girl I knew when I was 13. but that was the closest thing I ever had and (will have) of a girlfriend. she eventually started talking to me solo and developed affection for me. she didn&#039;t have a flirty personality, but with me she would constantly flirt. I didn&#039;t know at the time what &quot;flirt&quot; even was. but I still blame my 13 year old self for being a clueless idiot and not have picked up on the hints. not only that but the kids too would tell me that she and I &quot;looked like a couple&quot;, But I didn&#039;t think anything of it at the time. fast forward 2 years and I had to move out of town with my family. not only I lost my friends, but also potential love. I lost everything in a single swoop. why? my family wanted to go on &quot;vacation&quot;. the only catch being we would be on &quot; vacation&quot; for two whole years. I eventually had to go to another school.

As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved.&quot;</span><br><br>Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.", "filename": "1611312397491", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1675109514548140, "time": 1675109514, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 28236137}, {"no": 28236521, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)15:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28236137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28236137</a><br><a href=\"#p28236512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28236512</a><br>So read NDE accounts and basically all you can about NDEs. Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here. As NDErs say, everybody on Earth is a star on the other side for having the courage and endurance to come to this nightmare hellhole.", "filename": "1615120187322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675109576181623, "time": 1675109576, "md5": "VSla6OBrWteYgUkZkobScA==", "fsize": 7568, "resto": 28236137}, {"no": 28236715, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)15:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28236512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28236512</a><br><a href=\"#p28236521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28236521</a><br> This concept is somewhat new to me but i&#039;ll certainly watch and read everything on links you&#039;ve posted.

It is essential that you work on these aspects. To do this you have to know yourself, forgive your sins, and accept yourself as you are with both good things and bad things. It can be difficult, and if necessary seek therapy.<br>Well, having said that, there is the most important question, where to get girls. What I recommend is that you go to a charity center, and help the most needy people, there are usually girls. You can also go to a dance school, and there you will find many girls, of course you will be ashamed for never having danced in your life, and for never having danced with a woman, but you have to overcome those fears. Usually good girls go to those places, and you will feel better about yourself since you will learn new skills or you will be helping others, which regardless of the girlfriend is a very good thing.<br>Then there are the more secondary tips, dress well, be hygienic, be respectful, among others. There are many personal image videos and tutorials. In fact, there are entire guides of people who are dedicated to this, whether it&#039;s dancing, improving your self-esteem, taking care of your hair, or those things. But women want a self-confident man, someone loyal, sincere, and respectful. Don&#039;t be afraid to show yourself as you are.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izG<wbr>wDsrQ1eQ", "filename": "guide", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1294, "h": 602, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1674971914557545, "time": 1674971914, "md5": "N1j5v36LGH/OkNWZflzPeQ==", "fsize": 143148, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225549, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:17:14", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225435</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Horrible upbringing</span><br>The past is not worth living in, forgive your parents and try to move on.

Read about some trades, see what they are about, join forums of people who do those trades, talk to them and ask their experience.<br>Study anon, it&#039;s okay to play video games, but dedicate some time to study, learn to do things with your hands, fix things, solve problems, you&#039;re a man, stop acting like a child and do what you have to do.<br><br>https://youtu.be/eZ4CyORZ5ks", "filename": ".-", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 765, "h": 973, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674973034350981, "time": 1674973034, "md5": "opTJQ15ytxC7SZyU9OyiTg==", "fsize": 140726, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225556, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:18:30", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225440</a><br>I&#039;m glad I helped you anon", "time": 1674973110, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225636, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:46:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "22, no job exp, no education past HS, I can draw decently, I can very much edit and do graphic design somewhat.

Did you think that just by learning to draw you could earn money? Art doesn&#039;t move the world, nobody gives a shit about art, if I wanted to find a drawing of anything I just google it. But I think in order for you to make money drawing, you have to specialize in very fetishistic and disgusting shit, it&#039;s not morally correct, and you would have to deal with the worst scourge of this miserable world. Draw porn that is very hard to find on google, usually it will be very degenerate and dirty stuff, or illegal realistic content. I heard that furry porn pays well, but you have to do something within it that is very fetish and niche, something so nasty and specific so you don&#039;t have a lot of competition. You can use the money earned and reinvest it in buying used things in garage stores and selling them on facebook or ebay.<br>I really recommend that you look for another way to earn money, art is a beautiful activity, but it is difficult to make it profitable, I think you should look for a profession as a farmer or something like that if you want to go and live far from society.<br>https://youtu.be/o1tj2zJ2Wvg", "filename": "( ( my place", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1386, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674975889900682, "time": 1674975889, "md5": "quurKykUNBCTjwZ0cAkO+g==", "fsize": 585753, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225711, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:06:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225706</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just become a farmer bro</span><br>I CAN&#039;T.

Should I be casual and say &quot;let&#039;s meet on Saturday&quot; or should I be more serious like &quot;do you want to see each other again?&quot;", "filename": "image_2023-01-31_032608999", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 639, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1675135575834774, "time": 1675135575, "md5": "dSK9o7+tIhZuy7Ok0j1Bcw==", "fsize": 298618, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-should-i-do", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28238301, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)19:38:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are you a cuck if your bi-sexual spouse gets with someone of the same gender?", "filename": "Sweet+watery+stylish_ecb2b6_10240065", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 790, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 164, "tim": 1675125493269714, "time": 1675125493, "md5": "oRJKdoUw/f7q4ubeCGPQvw==", "fsize": 216844, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "are-you-a-cuck-if-your-bisexual-spouse-gets-with", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 28238350, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)19:48:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "To be made a cuckold has lost its entire meaning in the first place.
