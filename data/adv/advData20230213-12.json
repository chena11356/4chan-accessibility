I only work about 5hrs a week and earn more than most of my friends combined. I have too much free time, whereas they don&#039;t. I&#039;ve started going out solo to bars and clubs during the weekend and have had great success. I usually drink some vodka at home before heading out to call my nerves, and once I get to the bar/club (much easier in a bar to converse), I usually sit in a table and scope out the area. Once I finish my first drink, I approach the bar and make conversation with the bartender (can be literally about anything, this is to make it seem like you&#039;re friendly to the people around you, smile when you can and throw in a couple laughs here and there). Once I get my drink, if there&#039;s anyone near me I find attractive/approachable, I do the same thing. I just go up to them and compliment their looks, ask their opinion on something random, or just ask if I can join them and offer to pay for a round (surprisingly, this will oftentimes get you drinks paid for by them). You just have to get out there and do something. Staying couped up in your place nets you a zero percent chance of talking to someone and getting laid.

The more progressed the tumors become the less appetite the patient will have and the more they will waste away without feeling hungry. <br><br>This is a condition called cachexia (pronounced kahkexia) which is a wasting process that arises when cancer cells take advantage of the gluconeogenesis cycle. By taking advantage of the gluconeogenesis cycle, cancer cells are able to convert their lactic acid waste product (which wears down the tissues of the patient) back into glucose in the liver so it can be used by the cancer cells to create even more lactic acid in a never-ending process of destruction. Cachexia induces a state where the patient no longer feels hungry as their glucose levels are perpetually high while they continue to waste away due to lactic acid build up. Cancer cells consume glucose at about a 10x higher rate than normal cells, which is why they shine brightly on a PET scan, This heightened glucose will induce the feeling of not being hungry while the body deteriorates rapidly.<br><br>If you want to get into this topic more then I suggest starting with this post that I wrote for someone on here about two years ago.

Jesse said that men represent Christ on Earth, especially when they are born again, but even a weak man represents Christ (albeit a poor representation). Jesse said it&#039;s abnormal for men to have anger; every man who has anger has the nature of his mother. That&#039;s why men can&#039;t find peace in that state. The man&#039;s nature is honesty, trust, sound mind &amp; body, and he is able to help his woman in the right way. The father is supposed to protect the children from the mother (who is often angry), but because he needs the woman in the wrong way, she ends up destroying the children. The woman should come into the man&#039;s world, not the other way around. Women are hungry for a real man. They want a man who is committed to doing what is right. Men have to become a living example. A man is not a macho person; he is of love\u2014real love. Not the emotional type of love, but the love that has no anger\u2014no hate. Your thoughts are your greatest enemy. Drop anger so you can overcome the lie of the imagination. You must forgive in order to be a Son of God. </span><br><br>...

Over the eyes? Back of the head? Temples? <br>How&#039;s your sleep? Are you getting 8+ hours a night?<br><br>Anything canned with acidic foods, especially tomatoes should not be used. With your condition being as it is I would try to rule them out altogether. In this situation your endocrine has become somewhat pathological and it&#039;s probably an entire environment&#039;s worth of factors that have brought this state about.<br><br>The endocrine system is a network of organs throughout the body all of which work to maintain a hormonal homeostasis. If even one of these organs is in stress it stresses the rest of them out as well and if the environmental issues are not resolved a pathological homeostasis takes form which creates a normal state of unhealth. The problem, once this happens, is that to break an existing homeostasis requires a sharp shock to it. So you may have to make some drastic changes in order to turn things around.<br><br>Here are a few of them, there are more but these are the most important:<br><br>Vitamin D3 deficiency is a worldwide epidemic. Vitamin D is not really a vitamin, it&#039;s a prohormone and it plays myriad of roles throughout the entirety of our organism. You may want to get a blood test which tests for both the active and inactive form of vitamin D to see where your levels really are. Regardless, with most people being deficient I strongly suggest supplementing with 5000-10,000IU a day especially during the winter and the times where you&#039;re not getting sunlight. Vitamin D3 should be taken with K2 as vitamin K2 ensures that the vitamin-d associated calcium ends up where it&#039;s needed and not in the areas where it can induce trouble. As for a supplement, I recommend the Dr. Berg brand as it&#039;s the cheapest combo with U.S. made ingredients.", "time": 1676082338, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320800, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320794</a><br>The liver is a secondary organ in the endocrine system but its role should not be written off. When you take NSAIDs regularly, which is particularly common for women with painful menstrual cycles, you begin to deteriorate your liver&#039;s capacity. Since you&#039;re having so many recurring migraines I can only imagine how often you rely on these to get through the day. To stop taking them is probably not an option, nor would I want you to suffer. But what you should do is chase every NSAID with at least 600mg of N-Acetyl-Cysteine, preferably Pure Encapsulations brand as they&#039;re a U.S. manufacturer that doesn&#039;t use Chinese ingredients. NAC helps replete the master antioxidant glutathione within your liver which NSAIDs rapidly deplete. Chronic use of NSAIDs will keep your liver in a perpetual state of unhealth by suppressing glutathione levels which can, over time, exacerbate and further allow this pathological homeostasis of your endocrine system to persist.<br><br>From what I&#039;m observing based off what you have provided you are expressing multiple symptoms of estrogen dominance. This can be overcome but to break the current homeostasis requires a shock. The strongest shock you can provide, in my opinion, is fasting. I think a 3 a day water fast every month for 4-6 months might be exactly what you need to start recovering. If you are the type of person that eats three meals a day you may want to work yourself to one meal a day before going for a three day fast. To go from three meals a day to no meals a day is really difficult for people doing their first multi-day fast. You can do it, it&#039;s just more stress on the body than it would be if you were already eating one meal a day.", "time": 1676082399, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320807, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320800</a><br><br>Second, you&#039;re going to want to get an intracellular magnesium and potassium test as these are the electrolytes that are most often related to estrogen dominance and glandular function. You need to specifically ask for an intracellular test for these electrolytes as they are intracellular electrolytes (98-99% are within your cells). If you rely upon a blood serum test you&#039;re not going to be able to adequately diagnose a deficiency until its in its latest stages. For some, magnesium can make migraines worse so use caution with them. I would start with magnesium glycinate and then work from there if that form of Mg induces migraines. Try to find a form of magnesium that does not stimulate migraines if you can, don&#039;t give up if the first brand/type you try induces them. For potassium I recommend buying Dr. Berg&#039;s electrolyte powder as it has 1000mg of potassium (4,700mg is the recommended daily intake) per scoop. It&#039;s the most affordable way to supplement with potassium that I have found. Most potassium in the diet comes from vegetables so you may want to try to figure out how much you need to supplement with to ensure you&#039;re meeting your dietary requirement. <br><br>Third thing you&#039;re going to want to do is clear the body out of heavy metals which you have been accumulating throughout your life. The safest way to do this is by way of Modified Citrus Pectin. 5mg/3x/day for 1 month (PectaSol / Econeugenics brand) should clear the majority of what can be cleared out minus what has been sequestered in bone of course. As a side note, I would also ditch any teflon cookware that you have and replace them with cast iron, ceramic, stainless steel or carbon steel.", "time": 1676082459, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320815, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320807</a><br>Next you will need to deal with your drinking water issue. Bottled water inevitably leaches chemicals from the plastics even if it&#039;s a BPA-free plastic. I recommend dropping money on a distilled water system and adding your own trace minerals to it or using electrolyte powders to get the needed electrolytes. The brand of distiller I recommend is the My Pure Water brand:<br><br>https://mypurewater.com/shop/mini-c<wbr>lassic-ct-distiller/<br><br>I own this one myself and it&#039;s a great machine; it&#039;s easy to maintain and only requires a once a month cleaning to keep going. If you&#039;re making soups, broths or use water for boiling to make rice/pasta then I would also invest in an undersink filter to filter out your municipal water, especially fluoride which is notorious for wreaking havoc to the endocrine system (I&#039;ll get to fluoride more in a second). The system I use is this one: <br><br>https://www.amazon.com/Frizzlife-SK<wbr>99-NEW-Certified-Chlorine-Chloramin<wbr>e/dp/B08NDYVZV5/<br><br>As for fluoride, I would immediately stop using fluoride toothpastes. I would also be mindful of any canned foods packed in water (often packed in municipal fluoridated water) and if you can get a flouride-rated shower filter that would be helpful as well. The problem with fluoride is that it accumulates as it&#039;s readily retained at a rate of 35% - 50% of that which is ingested (younger people retaining more than adults). And when fluoride gets retained it gets sequestered in bone. The presence of iodine triggers its release and removal and there has been some brewing hypotheses regarding using iodine as a way of treating long-term fluoride toxicity.", "time": 1676082521, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320819, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:29:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320641</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m pretty sure the director would never admit to that</span><br>How have you not seen the video?

Brita filters do not remove fluoride so I don&#039;t know how long you have been drinking municipal water but you might have significant load of fluoride sequestered throughout your body.

However, don&#039;t be surprised if you get a blank look in return. Unfortunately many doctors are just not well-versed with holistic health. In these situations take advantage of their diagnostic tools but you&#039;ll have to be your own doctor to really get at the root of the problem.<br><br>Not to get too wordy but there are also a few things that I want to add:<br><br>It may feel like you have cancer; however, when the female reproductive system is in great stress it tends to become fibrotic. The ovaries, the uterus, the fallopian tubes and the breasts can all start to become fibrotic and these fibroids can mimic how it feels to have a malignant tumor. A nonfunctional cyst is simply one that remains in-between menstrual cycle. It&#039;s a reason for concern, sure, but that doesn&#039;t mean the cyst is a malignant tumor. The doctor would be better able to diagnose this based on the MRI result and it seems that they believe it&#039;s a cyst. Now these cysts can and do induce inflammation and chronic inflammation can induce the formation of tumors so it&#039;s best to treat this now instead of trying to suffer with it.<br><br>I also forgot to mention the role of the liver in my many paragraphs. The liver removes excess estrogen once that estrogen has performed its function and then disposes of it in the colon so it can be removed as waste. NSAID usage stresses the liver which taxes the liver&#039;s ability to perform this role; N-Acetyl-Cysteine supplementation helps reduce that stress by alleviating NSAID-induced toxicity while also repleting the intracellular master antioxidant glutathione within the liver. NAC will greatly reduce the stress that your liver is under which should help it clear out that excess estrogen better.", "time": 1676252522, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28336300, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28318791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28318791</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forced to wait for 3 months while in pain coming from part of your reproductive system.</span><br>must be some of that glorious state-provided free healthcare I hear so much about from thirdworlders.", "time": 1676252941, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28336334, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:54:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28318791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28318791</a><br>Are you get vaxed?", "time": 1676253249, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28338114, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:35:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320218</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have thinning hair yes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019ve always had trouble with acne every since grade 8 or even before</span><br>Your gut health is probably poor, and you probably have thyroid deficiency.<br>Do you use birth control, or an IUD?

Thinking that virginity is a burden to be rid of, though, is not just a red flag but a dealbreaker under any circumstances. That shows a specific lack of concern for monogamy.<br><br>The only reason why a guy would expect or prefer nonvirginity is if he places greater emphasis on sex than commitment. If he wants to get himself off quickly and easily, then sure, he&#039;ll assume virgin women would take too long to coax into bed and then teach. But that&#039;s hardly the kind of guy a woman looking for a serious relationship should be trying to appeal to.<br>Mind you, there are some guys who want women ONLY for their virginity, without any moral reason.
