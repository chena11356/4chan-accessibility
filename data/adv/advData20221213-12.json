But my advice for stopping is to stay away, and if you must, look with passing interest. Remember, all of this is excessively fleeting and 99% of it is valueless.<br><br>Meanwhile, on twitter, I got banned there too. Although my &quot;death threat&quot; (using navy seals copypasta) ban was a misunderstanding, the only regret I have from it is that it pushed me to 4chan. On twitter, I&#039;d argue, and looking at the things i was posting before my ban, I was more toxic and heated than I should ever be. It draws you in. Now and then, ill look at random tweets and look around, and often time, someone is posting something astoundingly stupid that needs calling out, but its not worth it.

Being a virgin for most of my life I was shocked to discover sex wasn&#039;t as pleasurable as jerking off to porn. I struggled to maintain elections and when I could it was almost impossible to cum from PIV, blowjobs or basically any sex act from my fantasies. Really fucked with my wife&#039;s self esteem. I tried abstaining from porn for periods and over time our sex improved but I was always craving the trance-like dopamine haze of edging to porn and would do so when she left the house or went to sleep.<br><br>One day I forgot to cover my tracks and she found a handful of women&#039;s Facebook profiles opened in my browser history, including her best friend&#039;s. Though I never flirted with any of these women it really destroyed my wife&#039;s trust in me, rightfully so. I had a lot of creepy behaviors that I justified because I never physically cheated or talked to other women. But during our argument that the introspection that followed I realized just how addicted to porn I was and my furious wife was actually incredibly supportive and gave me multiple chances to be honest and seek recovery from my porn habit. She said it was the dishonesty that hurt more than anything.<br><br>I tried going to 12 step programs and I had some long periods of sobriety but the urges and fantasies were always there in the back of my mind. Eventually I started looking at porn behind my wife&#039;s back again. Eventually she would find out about my relapse and angrily confront me. I would apologize and recommit to sobriety only to fail a few months or weeks later. <br><br>Unsurprisingly, we&#039;re getting divorced now.

I have asked Reddit this before, but I am going to try here for a... &quot;different&quot; perspective.<br><br>Here&#039;s my situation:<br>I am a 49 year old mother. My son is 24 and he is my only child. To my knowledge, he has never had a girlfriend (or any romantic relationship--I don&#039;t care if he&#039;s gay). This is extremely confusing and, honestly, concerning for me. I was with his father (who is still my husband) since I was 20 years old. We got married 4 years later and then we had our child. Even before getting with my husband, I always had some kind of relationship and so did pretty much everyone else I knew.<br><br>I know this &quot;incel&quot; thing has taken hold of lots of young people and that things are way different now than when I was &quot;on the scene&quot; so to speak, but I just wrap my head around this. My boy isn&#039;t the stereotypical &quot;incel&quot; in that he doesn&#039;t hate women (or at least not vocally), he doesn&#039;t complain about being alone, he isn&#039;t ugly, he is pretty sociable (maybe a little quiet and shy but not disgustingly so), he is in grad school and seems hopeful about the future. He&#039;s made enough good bets in crypto to afford his own house and pay for his education, so in general he&#039;s doing pretty well.<br><br>But this is exactly why I cannot understand how he has never brought someone home. His father already had a child at his age. I mean, beyond my admittedly selfish desire to have at least one grandkid, this is just mind boggling to me. Are things really that messed up in the dating world that a guy like my son can&#039;t get dates? Did I mess him up in raising him somehow? I thought we gave him a good upbringing.
