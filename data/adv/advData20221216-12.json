However, I think instead of searching for gain, you would do better to search for loss. That appears more the issue. Not to gain a new mentality or a new perspective or a new mindset, but to lose the ones you have now. You need to lose what isn&#039;t currently serving you before there is room to gain what will serve you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people just have a better time when I&#039;m not around.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m just very boring I think.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Probably creepy too because I have so little social experience.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think I&#039;m a very pathetic person</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if I was someone else I wouldn&#039;t want to be near me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at this point in my life I know it&#039;s over and I am going to be alone for the rest of my life.</span><br><br>Lose all of these. They are very likely untrue. But, irrespective of their truth, they are not serving you. They are hindering and hurting you. They hold you back and likely act as self-fulfilling prophecies. This self-abusive mindset sabotages you, and is very likely the proximate cause of the current state of suffering you now find yourself in. <br><br>For something tangible and actionable, you could learn about self-compassion and learn to more accurately analyze the root of these types of negative statements. Then you learn to replace them with positive ones. Alternatively, there&#039;s things like CBT where you likewise learn to analyze these types of cognitive distortions. Remove and replace. That&#039;s the common theme. Both involve practice and application, and that practice will retrain your thoughts and your behaviors so that the bad thoughts are no longer automatic. The self-abuse is no longer automatic. The good becomes automatic. <br><br>Buddhism. Stoicism. Taoism. Et cetera. There are many paths, but be sure of this: you need to lose before you can gain. You&#039;ll find that theme in many.", "time": 1671174600, "resto": 27922318}, {"no": 27925123, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)02:12:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m about to go to sleep, and I&#039;m thinking about the witch, again.

I was putting out all the signals to others that I didn&#039;t want to be bothered, and then was shocked when people just left me alone. In solely my own imagination was I someone who was warm, friendly, and easygoing. I&#039;m glad I realized this and also that my incredibly low self esteem at the time was due to me being incompetent due to the lack of self awareness, rather than just me being born a loser. This meant I could change it. Those people who were sociable and good looking put a TON of effort into doing every little thing, and I mean really everything, they were so much smarter and deliberate than I gave them credit for.

When we went inside to see the rest of the shop, I got swamped by a bunch of autistic people who all wanted to talk to us (see: me).

Women who accept drinks in a club only want free stuff. If the nightclub is your game and you want to spend money, pay for table service.

Look goofy but with a smile. Unless you\u2019re a world class dancer, you will not impress her with your moves. It\u2019s all about body language in s club. If you can get her to dance with you for at least 2 songs, then you have a good chance of asking if she wants to sit down and talk. But even when that happens, be fun. Talk about how you like to go out and blow off steam. Or, if you\u2019ve got the real acting chops, point to some random guys and say \u201cI came here with some friends, but they weren\u2019t much fun.

Just walk up to them and introduce yourself. Say you usually go to a different club and are checking out the scene. Ask if they come often and or not where they recommend. Make yourself seem like a nomad who sees value in their input without giving them control of the conversation. Then, after a few minutes, move on to the next group. When you do this, you realize that everyone in the club is just there for a good time and no one will think much about you for a few seconds. Plus, eventually your routine can form. You can reference either people, maybe say \u201chey have you seen that dude\u2019s jacket? What\u2019s with that!\u201d Or something silly to start the convo. Maybe make some jokes about the DJ. If you make it apparent you\u2019ve met most people in the club, you instantly become the cool guy there and girls will want to chat a little longer. And if they tell you to screw off, shrug and dance away.

Very cute girl around 28 years old. Our first real interaction was me getting her to stand on a scale that told her what she would weigh in mars, jokingly of course.

Just be clean, smell normal and have something to talk about that\u2019s relevant to her or where you\u2019re at.<br>For instance, I once dated a girl I met at universal studios. She worked in the one of the gift shops and I needed help putting back a shirt on a high shelf. She brought out a stick and told me she uses it because she\u2019s short. I laughed and said \u201cthat\u2019s okay, I\u2019m also short.

But a lot of Twitter has to do with you being okay with long distance if you can\u2019t meet someone close by. The key with Twitter is to start a conversation on a public tweet, usually replying to each other based on whatever thread was of interest, then adding a follow and saying \u201cyou\u2019re interesting, I\u2019ll follow you\u201d or something like that. Then interact with her tweets in between other tweets. She can\u2019t think you only use Twitter for her, or that you only use Twitter to hit up chicks.

The first one is how fast they reply to you. If they reply faster than 5 minutes, they\u2019re engaged in the conversation.<br>Second, how long the convo lasts.

If she self deprecates, it\u2019s so you can respond with flattery. If they want to talk about their hobbies, it\u2019s because they want to open up to you.

It\u2019s true, not every girl will care. But most will, and usually you can get by on the looks department as long as you\u2019re groomed properly and dressed in a presentable manner.

I think most people who go to therapy really struggle with that (or we wouldn&#039;t need therapy lol). It&#039;s your therapist&#039;s job to help you to overcome that anxiety, and to help you to express yourself. I understand why you would feel apprehensive about going into therapy and putting yourself through that discomfort again, but this could potentially be really good for you.

In the future, it might be a good idea to talk about your faith in the occult, and seek therapists who work holistically with the faith of their clients.

A few days later things were improving, and I created an improved dating profile. I matched with BLUE, and we hit it off and kept seeing each other over the week. <br>However, unbeknownst to me, ORANGE contacted my family about the breakup and said it was likely due to stress on my end, and so my parents convinced me to get back with ORANGE. I thought it could have been a mistake, and wasn\u2019t sure the fling with BLUE would progress, so I got back with ORANGE. <br>I ended things with BLUE, telling her I couldn\u2019t commit to a new relationship immediately.<br><br>What I didn\u2019t expect, was that BLUE said she was happy to wait until the new year.

Point being my libido started shutting down along with my emotions and I stopped really feeling &quot;horny&quot; the way you&#039;re supposed to at some point when I was 16 and it never really came back - or my emotions fully for that matter.

Also, they have histories of severe depressive episodes, and they have hinted at the *possibility* that there was a suicide somewhere in the family as a result of severe depression. <br><br>Here is where things get more difficult for me: my father only sought treatment for half of his disability (he received SSRIs for &quot;depression&quot;) and frequently went off treatments during his manic phases; he grew to mistrust doctors and stopped getting help altogether.
