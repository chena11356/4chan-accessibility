You should feel a roughly walnut sized lump (maybe a bit smaller) that kinda feels like the inside of your dick. It will feel kinda nice to touch but probably nothing special initially. Of course do this with a clean rectum and use plenty of lube, don&#039;t force anything in, relax your anus etc etc.<br><br>For prostate masturbation, watching porn helps a lot to get you extra horny. Gently rub the prostate with one or two fingers, over a period of 10-20 minutes it will swell and fill with fluid and feel even more pleasurable. It&#039;s fine to touch your dick initially just to keep the arousal up. <br><br>You probably won&#039;t get a true prostate orgasm your first few times (or even for a long time), but it still feels way better than just touching your dick alone. Deep breathing is beneficial to relaxing your whole body and getting in a good headspace. I&#039;ve never gotten a true prostate orgasm with just my fingers, but a small vibrating prostate massager set to a pulsed mode (~1 second on, 1 second off) works best for me to build arousal. Eventually if you do it right you will feel this swelling rising sensation throughout your stomach and be hit with intense waves of pleasure without the feeling of ejaculating from your balls. With prostate orgasms I can have them continuously with no refractory period, it feels like a warm spreading throughout all of my insides instead of a brief intense release like a normal ejaculatory orgasm.<br><br>Hope this helps.", "time": 1670609328, "resto": 27883318}, {"no": 27886266, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:25:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27884388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27884388</a><br>NTA but my prostate feels hard even and really sensible when starting.", "time": 1670631916, "resto": 27883318}, {"no": 27886711, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:42:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27883318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27883318</a>", "filename": "s-l500", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1670636573596888, "time": 1670636573, "md5": "Kn5Ug9oPJVdKqrcBiwK84A==", "fsize": 18157, "resto": 27883318}, {"no": 27886727, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:45:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27884373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27884373</a><br>It means you can squeeze your hard dick in your fist and it feels hard<br><br>if you grab the biggest shit you ever shitted out the toilet and squeeze it, it&#039;s gonna collapse like the soft creamy shit that it is.

So how do I fix that?</span><br>Basically, you have to stop being such a fucking asshole all the time. Don&#039;t worry; I&#039;ll elaborate more. Your family history is sad, but not surprising. It definitely fits a profile. Your parents did a shit job. That&#039;s not your fault...but it IS your responsibility to fix now if you want things to turn around. And considering how you said you were raised by a Super Nintendo and not some variety of Playstation or X Box I&#039;m gonna guess that you&#039;re not young either. Meaning it&#039;s well past the time to learn how to interact with people.<br>And I think a part of your problem is that you&#039;ve come to define yourself solely by your interests, and likewise define other people by theirs. YOU are not anime or Evil Dead, and likewise someone who doesn&#039;t like those things is not making a personal attack. Likewise, these other people are not the Minnesota Vikings or whatever. There is more to them, and there would be more to you if you stopped hiding it.<br>The other problem here is that you&#039;ve divided people based on their interests as either &quot;normie&quot; (hilarious considering your video game taste) or as &quot;based 4chan autists!&quot; or whatever the fuck. And I think a lot of that is simply contrarianism on your part. For example, you said you&#039;d date a trekkie, even though you didn&#039;t say you&#039;re into Star Trek. So why the exception then? Oh right, because Trek isn&#039;t &quot;normie&quot; so it&#039;s ok for people to like whether you like it or not yourself. And since you have this childish black and white view of the world, you don&#039;t seem to realize that there are people out there who like football and Game of Thrones, AND video games and cheesy horror movies. I would know; I&#039;m one of them.<br>So you need to learn to stop pigeonholing people (yourself included) by their interests, learn to find common ground, and learn to read the room to figure out when people don&#039;t want to hear your shit.
