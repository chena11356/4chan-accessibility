They were 500$ more expensive than getting the parts yourself and building it. He got mad that I called his idea a scam and after talking it out I saw the error of what I did and apologized, but the problem is I keep doing this sort of thing.

The whole natural order of things are being violated by kikes and that is why you came down to your conclusion inside your post. There are still pockets of communities that practice the natural order in regards to mating. They are propagating large families and they are multiplying at gradual but noticeable rates. Marriage is a contract being formed for a household being established. Households are like businesses, they need contracts. When you deny marriage, you deny yourself a household and when you deny a household; then you will become old and alone teetering on the brink of homelessness. Wake up guys, you&#039;re being lied to. This is a slow decay on our countries and peoples in the long run - you can still survive its consequences though. You do this by completely rejecting the kike proposed mating model and mold yourself in embracing natural model which is 2 people coming together to establish a household and birthing a liter of children. When the children grow older, they will establish their own households. Multiple families means many routes of passive incomes which is a better safety net than what the government provides you.

Silent Generation was inclined to say &quot;if everyone jumped off a cliff would you do it too?&quot; usually by Silent Generation as teachers and seniority. I can understand if the normie/npc doesnt want to talk to Dungeons and Dragons guy, when they berated and treat them with contempt despite not even talking to the npc/normie that is abuse. Anyway, Millennial normies/npcs sought to create the perfect comfort zone: everyone only talks about the music, movies and current thing in vogue, everyone has a dress code and there is no &quot;randomness&quot;.

Outliers (with good meaning) sought the company of the main group and would contact them offering plans like &quot;hey lets go for coffee&quot;, &quot;lets watch a movie&quot;, &quot;lets play video games&quot; etc. The main group member(s) would be disgusted, outraged or humoured and that gave the main group entertainment when they met for example:<br>&quot;OMG that guy just messaged me to go for a coffee&quot;<br>&quot;Thats weird...&quot; <br>&quot;Its funny that those people think they can hang out with us&quot;<br>&quot;I know lol&quot;<br>The way that main group behaved in parties with different groups was to appear as exclusive and gatekeepery as possible. The ploy was that they should NOT talk to other groups and that the other groups SHOULD talk to them. They greet the outliers and indulge them with their company only so that the outliers crowd around them to show to others that they were &quot;desirable&quot;. They rather not meet a single new person than go out of their way to say hello to someone. I remember that they would &quot;trial&quot; outliers for the night for the &quot;chance&quot; to be a main. Outliers used to get to happy (I was happy for them, actually) and suddenly would not invite them out again if ever. Once the outliers stopped lingering, crowding around and offering them plans the main group turned on itself and eventually dissolved. The excitement came from others seeking their company and as that stopped they got bored of themselves. And the girls they got to meet left as well (I suppose they didnt have any new material to tell the girls that others wanted to be in their group so badly).", "time": 1675032254, "resto": 28221923}, {"no": 28230515, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:22:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28229505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28229505</a><br>Ok, it COULD happen.

If it will, how much longer? I am not a drawfag or anything, but I think more people are at risk than they think. (Although my sister, who I love, IS an animation student, so I fear for her too.)<br><br>I am very grateful for your advice and I will do my best to follow it, thank you for your kindness.

Truckers were supposed to be put out of work a dozen times by now. The world was supposed to run out of oil by now. Nuclear fusion was supposed to be out by now. Whole cities and states were meant to be completely under the ocean by now. Know what actually changed? Not a whole damn lot. Don&#039;t get so worked up about the future, or how changes in tech will effect it. It&#039;s not a problem that effects you currently, and most of the time your imagination, or the news, or hype-trains will give you an extremely hyperbolic version of something to get your attention, but that&#039;s all it&#039;s for. People have been through thousands of years of relatively large change in tech, and every time people think that life will change so much, and it really never does.

I believe that to get out of depression, tiredness, fatigue and all that shit, you first have to work your body, since a healthy body is a healthy mind, for that it is good to do sports, whatever it is. it is as long as it keeps our body busy. Another important factor is studying, it doesn&#039;t really matter what, it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s for university, school or for yourself, you have to do it to keep your mind occupied with something productive. I would also say that looking for a job, or generating income with a startup, as this will keep our mind and body busy, while giving us money, in itself gives us a reason to keep going, especially when you are working on something of your own.<br><br>Another important point is to stop comparing yourself to others, stop thinking that the other is better than you because you have more knowledge, money or physical condition. It is also very silly to think about issues such as superiority or inferiority, we are all human, we all have problems and difficulties in life, of course there are degrees of this, but this does not have to be a limitation. You have to focus on yourself, on your problems, on your virtues, on your life, and not on that of others.<br><br>Another issue is guilt and remorse, which depending on the person can be the easiest part, or difficult to overcome, because it is easy to forgive others, but sometimes it is difficult, if not impossible, to forgive yourself. No matter how dirty your hands are, they can always be cleaned. You have to accept your sins, accept what you did wrong and live with it. Go to a priest, a psychologist, or tell someone you trust what you did, this can help, it doesn&#039;t matter if you think psychology is a joke, or if you don&#039;t believe in God, the important thing is to somehow get the weight off What are you wearing.", "filename": "b3d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 657, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1674863961876206, "time": 1674863961, "md5": "/ckkLToCRMe9uKIXDVDZTA==", "fsize": 38305, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-this-thread-we-are-going-to-look-for-the-cure", "replies": 78, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 42}, {"no": 28216874, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)18:59:55", "name": "OP", "com": "My least favorite part of this thread is going to a psychiatrist and being prescribed medication, which in itself sucks.

It is essential that you work on these aspects. To do this you have to know yourself, forgive your sins, and accept yourself as you are with both good things and bad things. It can be difficult, and if necessary seek therapy.<br>Well, having said that, there is the most important question, where to get girls. What I recommend is that you go to a charity center, and help the most needy people, there are usually girls. You can also go to a dance school, and there you will find many girls, of course you will be ashamed for never having danced in your life, and for never having danced with a woman, but you have to overcome those fears. Usually good girls go to those places, and you will feel better about yourself since you will learn new skills or you will be helping others, which regardless of the girlfriend is a very good thing.<br>Then there are the more secondary tips, dress well, be hygienic, be respectful, among others. There are many personal image videos and tutorials. In fact, there are entire guides of people who are dedicated to this, whether it&#039;s dancing, improving your self-esteem, taking care of your hair, or those things. But women want a self-confident man, someone loyal, sincere, and respectful. Don&#039;t be afraid to show yourself as you are.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izG<wbr>wDsrQ1eQ", "filename": "guide", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1294, "h": 602, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1674971914557545, "time": 1674971914, "md5": "N1j5v36LGH/OkNWZflzPeQ==", "fsize": 143148, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225549, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:17:14", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225435</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Horrible upbringing</span><br>The past is not worth living in, forgive your parents and try to move on.

Did you think that just by learning to draw you could earn money? Art doesn&#039;t move the world, nobody gives a shit about art, if I wanted to find a drawing of anything I just google it. But I think in order for you to make money drawing, you have to specialize in very fetishistic and disgusting shit, it&#039;s not morally correct, and you would have to deal with the worst scourge of this miserable world. Draw porn that is very hard to find on google, usually it will be very degenerate and dirty stuff, or illegal realistic content.

You can use the money earned and reinvest it in buying used things in garage stores and selling them on facebook or ebay.<br>I really recommend that you look for another way to earn money, art is a beautiful activity, but it is difficult to make it profitable, I think you should look for a profession as a farmer or something like that if you want to go and live far from society.<br>https://youtu.be/o1tj2zJ2Wvg", "filename": "( ( my place", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1386, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674975889900682, "time": 1674975889, "md5": "quurKykUNBCTjwZ0cAkO+g==", "fsize": 585753, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225711, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:06:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225706</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just become a farmer bro</span><br>I CAN&#039;T.

Your body releases them when you feel secure with your partner and you feel committed to them. Your body tries to shut them down forcefully when your partner jeopardizes that feeling of security. The more shitty partners you have, the more banged up those receptors will be and they will start releasing deficient amounts as a self defense mechanism.

She walks into the kitched after 45 minutes and asks me, &quot;Hey, uh... is everything okay in here?&quot; like she can&#039;t see me elbow deep in some cheese sauce and noodles. Like, b- what the fuck do you think I&#039;m doing right now? You think I fist pots of macaroni for fun? It&#039;s cooking. I&#039;m cooking it. Go sit the fuck down. Anyways, it turned into more or like a macaroni soup I guess. The noodle to cheese ratio may have been a bit off but if we&#039;re being honest everybody&#039;s only in macaroni and cheese for the cheese anyways. The noodles are more of a filler. So you know I serve it up and she looks all excited to eat it. She takes one bite and gives me this look before asking, &quot;Can I use your bathroom?&quot;.

Maybe she&#039;s in there right now having the time of her life and just like a shy cummer or something. I know those japanese are pretty loud about it going on about feeling good and shit.

It&#039;s ultimately a neurodevelopmental disorder where the person does not develop mentally beyond a particular age from childhood. If that age is somewhere in their mid-late teens no problem.

Actually had a similar one while in college. Where I was, there was a pagoda way up on the side of a hill that would be lit up at night and it looked so beautiful and and fascinating from a distance. For the four years I was at college, I never dared go up to that pagoda, preferring to keep the magic alive by distantly gazing at it. The day after graduation, I decided to go up and see it.

Exposure is a fundamental part of that (Exposure Response Prevention is a common form of cognitive behavioral therapy). But therapists (good ones, anyway), know that simply throwing whatever is causing problems to the patient right at the patient without so much as a thought behind it is the same as tossing a small child in the deep end of the pool to teach him how to swim. Those children that survive will say \u201clol why don\u2019t hop in and learn\u201d. The children that drown won\u2019t say anything.

You read through the rules and instructions, and do some practice jobs and then they\u2019ll send you videos/audio files to write captions/transcriptions for. Sounds like pretty much exactly what you\u2019re looking for. But obviously there is a catch: it\u2019s not a real job. More like contracting gig, so no benefits. On top of that, you\u2019ll be earning less than minimum wage unless you\u2019re a savant, because they usually pay by hours of completed content, and the rate is very poor.
