I go out of my own way, for every single person. This is not hyperbole. I just left Walgreens. As I left, I was changing lanes, and happened to not use a turn signal - until I saw a father walking with his daughter on the sidewalk, and I immediately used the signal. My thought process was “it is a good influence on her, even if it is 0.01%”. But, this is just from an hour ago. All day, every single day, I am keenly aware of people around me. I often crack jokes in public, or just do whatever I can to clear whatever is in the air. I am like humanities cheerleader, but to an autistic degree. I care so deeply about the people I know well. I sometimes think in advance things that they will just love to hear or know. If something is wrong, whether stranger or family, it is instant for me to jump. It’s like compassion is my reflex.

Have good hygiene, if you smell like unwashed asshole its going to make her question her life decisions. I feel like this should be obvious but you&#039;d be surprised on the horror stories I&#039;ve heard<br>2. PAY ATTENTION TO THE CLIT. Most women are unable to orgasm from purely penetration. Using toys, rubbing her while penetrating, or eating out are all great things you might want to consider incorporating into your sex life<br>3. Have good foreplay and pay attention to how she responds. I hear a lot about how women were in pain their first time and thought &quot;that is just how it was supposed to be like&quot;. It shouldn&#039;t hurt. Good foreplay is an absolute essential in so that she actually enjoys it and so it doesn&#039;t hurt<br><br>Dick size does not fucking matter lmao its the least of your worries. Bigger doesn&#039;t always equal better. Honestly the biggest struggle is just getting in the mood in the first place, it&#039;s not as easy to do for women because there&#039;s generally less nerves to be stimulated (aside from clit) and because of hormone differences compared to men.

It sharpened my memory to an insane degree, it made food taste so much better, I’m always inspired to cook something, but I’m also much more inventive outside of the kitchen, and I have more energy.

And there’s an energy that you can lean into, where you get out of your head. I’ve never been able to hold eye contact, and when my eyes meet a girl’s they look away instantly. But after nofap, it happens much differently. I don’t get self-conscious about eye contact, it just happens, and when it does, I find curious, charmed or even visibly aroused girls on the receiving end. I’ve had girls stare at me for 10 straight seconds while blushing and biting her lip. You do not understand how diametrically opposite that is from my normal experience. I’m used to looks of disdain, dismissal or even contempt.<br><br>The nofap energy is fiery though. It can get dark and angry. You have to force yourself to have the right mentality.

You might genuinely love her with all your heart, but there are practical hurdles that you need to overcome... and that&#039;s not necessarily gonna be possible.<br><br>If I were you, I&#039;d make a point of talking to the gf about this (not about the other woman, but about your worries). Try to talk about your future and work out what it will realistically look like, whether you are both ok with making the necessary sacrifices to keep the relationship going, and what steps you can take to make it more bearable.<br>You obviously aren&#039;t happy to wait for her for 6-7 years while studying, for example. But she might be happy to study or work in YOUR country during that time period, so you can be together. She might not be happy to be away from her family for Christmas, but you might happily compromise by visiting her family for Christmas every year. See what kind of compromises you can make, and try to find a sustainable future for the relationship.<br><br>It sounds like you guys are serious about each other - a 3.5 year long LONG-TERM relationship is quite the fucking achievement.

I think they are likely very unhappy deep down with how their life is going, but I think that if you only make them feel awful and ashamed whenever you two hang out, they might not want to spend any time with you at all.<br><br>I completely understand the feeling of powerlessness as you watch someone you care about living a completely miserable life, but unfortunately for the most part it&#039;s out of your control.

Since my teenage days I always thought that I was depressed because I felt something &quot;wrong&quot; about me, but these last few years I was able to afford therapy, but to me surprise, both attempts I failed to qualify as depressed. They tested me and while I show some signs of mild depression, I&#039;m not depressed. I couldn&#039;t afford more time in therapy so I just tried to go on, but things didn&#039;t work out for me, I still struggled to finish things, even small ones and I was constantly switching form being super motivated to feeling with no motivation at all. <br>I&#039;m 26 now and I have failed at pretty much everything I&#039;ve tried because I wasn&#039;t persistant enough and I just wne to the next thing I wanted to try. College dropout, failed artist, dumped by gf that still loved me, unable to keep jobs, etc. No matter how much of a mess I was in, I was never able to commit to make significant improvements in my life, even if for certain periods I was super motivated. <br>At that point I&#039;ve already droped the idea of having some disorder and I thought I was just lazy (which is true) but then I saw this image and realized how much it fits to me situation. I never considered ADHD because while I always had problems to focus in my tasks, I was always calm and chill, but after reading more in depth I get that&#039;s not as simple as that, and that the whole thing really fits not only for my current situation, but also to my chilhood and teenage days. So while I know I can&#039;t diagnose myself, and I can&#039;t really afford looking for professional help or paying for meds, I have to work with what I have.<br>So well, I&#039;m mostly looking for a starting point and I prefer reading some experience about someone with ADHD instead of reading some article full of buzzwords.

They didn’t seem to mind it but I didn’t take a hint to slow down, with either me responding directly to something in their story or complimenting them making them uncomfortable, but ultimately I think it was not just leaving them alone. They eventually restricted me which I guess is better than block but obviously not good.<br><br>I content even just seeing they read it which why I kept going and I never lashed out, but I have a bad tendency to over apologize. They even sent me really nice long messages saying I was fine when I apologized, saying how much they appreciated me and missed both me and the rest of the others.<br><br>Over time I slowed down to just once a month but after being restricted, I waisted three months before just saying I’m so sorry. <br><br>A similar situation with someone else, during Xmas I sent just a Merry Christmas and they said it back but I never said anything after that. Thinking about that.<br><br>I know many are going to say just leave them alone, you’re retarded, or that I haven’t learned anything. I’m in a better place in life but this person had a huge objective impact and I feel I did a major disservice to them for that. I still think of them everyday, no matter what I try to do. Not related to that I take SSRI’s that manage the worst of it, but can someone suggest anything that isn’t just leave them alone?

Maybe you clearly see it as a joke and not to be taken seriously at all, but from an outside perspective could also be interpreted as using humor to casually and indirectly inform the viewer that you&#039;re looking for only hookups and that you don&#039;t agree with generally liberal ideologies.<br><br>Prompt 3 is kinda hard to mess up. &quot;yummy yummy in my tummy&quot; is probably better off removed though.<br><br>And for your bio, just don&#039;t mention MILFs lmao.

I rlly fcking do but I’m making the choice to put my foot down.

I’ve never had someone do that to me. <br><br>I feel like the closure I need is knowing why he was the way he was.. was it me? Was it him and he was just rlly insecure? <br><br>He told me I was a slut for a picture on fb that was of my face and then stuck up for this random girl he use to pay money to subscribe to her ONLYFANS.. he just randomly brought her up and told me straight up she had respect for herself when I never even asked or wanted to know.

He also would pretend like he was about to add some ice to the steaming pot of water, agonizingly slowly, just to quickly pull it away and laugh at me while also gaslighting me telling me that he already added ice!<br>- he raped me when I was only 7 (not even close to the worst thing)<br>- he also got me to &quot;play a game&quot; with him where I would put these little paper squares on my tongue and the longer I kept it on my tongue the more candy I would get... He was drugging me with LSD and torturing me to fuck me off mentally ASAP because he wanted me to qualify for disability benefits as a minor. He tortured me in a variety of ways...

If you’re just having general life issues they’ll usually say they can help, but if you want something specific like EMDR or you’re specifically looking for a childhood trauma therapist, they might tell you they have a different area of expertise and send you to someone else. Assuming you do decide to start seeing them, you’ll then have your first session. During the first session you will start giving them your mental “medical history” - your life story, how you grew up, what’s happening now, whether you take any medications or drugs, who are the people in your support network, etc. By the third session they start doing what they set out to do, which depends on the type of therapy you’re doing. What you described sounds like psychodynamic therapy, which will involve them asking questions about your life and coaxing you towards various insights based on your answers. Some methods, like CBT, will also involve them giving you “homework” in which you have to behave a certain way, do journaling, say affirmations, do breathing techniques, etc. Regardless of the type of therapy you’re doing, you will usually begin each subsequent session with an update on your progress, which usually involves a questionnaire about how you’re feeling and behaving. At some point during the process, you may be diagnosed with something - or you may just have general life issues rather than a mental illness. It’s a good idea to ask your therapist what they are diagnosing you with because not everyone will tell you right away and also because it can affect your insurance coverage.
