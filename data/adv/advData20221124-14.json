Everyone else I knew, despite any issue they may have, have a social circle, go out and do things and have hope for their future, as well as memories of past years spent doing the same thing. I don\u2019t have any of that, and I\u2019ll continue to waste my life at this rate.<br><br>I don\u2019t know what to do with my life. I don\u2019t have any friends and am incapable of connecting with others; I\u2019m not on the spectrum but I\u2019ve been isolated most of my life and grew up in a pretty bad household (my mum actually took me to a therapist when I was 15 and I got diagnosed with PTSD, but I\u2019m still on the therapy waiting list), and I view others as so alien now there\u2019s no hope, I think my misanthropy and social isolation have gone past the point of no return. I have no career path/anything I want to do, and I have no hobbies anymore. Most days I eat, sleep and repeat. My body is collapsing from years of rejecting eating out of hatred for myself, and most days I\u2019m so exhausted from something as simple as walking for a little while that I collapse onto my bed as soon as I get home.<br><br>I don\u2019t know what to do. This should be a fresh start, but I\u2019ve never felt so hopeless. I know I shouldn\u2019t but I resent normal \u2018happy\u2019 people and know that I\u2019ll never be able to join them, even if I had incentive to get better my quirks are too built into me now and I can\u2019t see a life other than this for me.<br>Sorry for sounding like such a whiny bitch, I\u2019m just really miserable. I wish I could\u2019ve turned out differently, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I could\u2019ve changed. Younger me honestly tried to make some sort of connection with others or find something I liked, and even then I still failed.

You can know something is bad and decide to quit, but you still go up against the basic urges/cravings. The rational mind is losing to basic, powerful impulses. Worth noting is that gambling, sex, compulsive overeating, alcoholism and drug addiction are a cluster of similar disorders. A malfunction of the brain&#039;s &quot;reward center&quot;.<br><br>Naltrexone is a helpful medication to remove the cravings. Classed as an opiate-antagonist (binds to receptors w/out &quot;high&quot;), Naltrexone comes in a once-monthly injection or daily pills. Absent insurance, injection is expensive and pills are inexpensive. Public health clinics, aka &quot;community clinics&quot; receive federal and state cost-reduction grants to serve people who lack insurance. Sliding-fee scale for most services and in the case of Naltrexone injection, often free. In the U.S. you can call 211 in most cities, a direct line to United Way. They will help you locate such a clinic. Also some anti-depressants and other psychotropic medications can help. Addicts tend to have mood or other psychiatric issues that are called &quot;co-morbid factors&quot;. A doctor at a &quot;community clinic&quot; can help with that also.
