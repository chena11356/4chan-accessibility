I don\u2019t think that has to be bad to do sometimes. But you don\u2019t want to eventually spring up and pick right back up where you started. And you also don\u2019t want to cultivate brooding, toxic emotions. <br><br>One of the great human problems is how insanely hard it is for us to ever take anything seriously, unless it is an acute threat, or a traumatic experience that forces us. I think it\u2019s important to understand that when I talk about seriousness, I\u2019m really talking about a depth and clarity, and a willingness. It\u2019s not just another emotion that you ride hard, it\u2019s a quality that comes from clarity\u2026 From seeing just how bad the situation really is. Decades of trying with zero results. From seeing that you have genuinely never gotten away with anything. We don\u2019t like things to be serious, so we hide from it, and distract ourselves from it and numb ourselves. And then we never change. I think true human maturity is when you can find this seriousness, and have your life and soul on the line, while simultaneously things feeling light and relaxed. There\u2019s a radical willingness behind all of that. The only way you can do what you need to do, and sustain it for as long as you need to, is if you learn to relax while being present with the stuff you want to avoid. And this is the key. Relaxing doesn\u2019t mean you make it feel any different. It means accepting it as it is, without stoking the fire nor repressing it. For example, you can be filled with anger, while sort of relaxing behind it. The way anger controls you is because it burns, and by thinking the thoughts and doing the things you do when you\u2019re angry, you get some kind of minor relief. But you can also just voluntarily explore that burning sensation, and be willing to experience it. Because you\u2019ve understood that you have no choice. You gain an enormous freedom from that, you grow up from it", "time": 1669628419, "resto": 27808913}, {"no": 27809888, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)08:18:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019m so depressed.
