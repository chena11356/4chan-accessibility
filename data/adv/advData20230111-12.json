Don&#039;t let your emotions of anger or sadness drive how you interact with them, keep things calm and light hearted and joke around. If they push you into those emotions then just let them know of your disapproval(This doesn&#039;t mean a speech just say &quot;Nah i&#039;m not about that&quot;) and then leave. Do nothing more than that.<br><br>2. Don&#039;t try to convince her,it&#039;s your way or you&#039;re out however be sensible about it(IE Don&#039;t go up and touch her and expect it to roll over well)<br><br>3. Encourage them that you want to LISTEN but when it comes to relationship advice,unless it concerns her on how you treat her then err on the side of caution or possibly even outright disregard it. If it is about her though then give it some real thought. If you&#039;ve ever read Anne Of Green Gables,women are at their happiest when they can be like Anne.(Read it if you haven&#039;t)<br><br>4. When you make a statement about your preferences, or plans stick to it and LIVE it. Be it if you tell a girl that one day you want to just simply travel the world,that you dislike people who show up late to dates or even if you say that you&#039;re gonna surprise her on her Birthday like 5 months from now,make sure you do it. Even if she challenges you with a hissy fit,you still do it. When you don&#039;t they lose respect and faith in you. Don&#039;t be flexible just be firm except AGAIN in a non-asshole way. They&#039;ll often come around and agree.<br><br>5. Stand up for yourself and learn to recognize BS so you can sweep a girls excuses aside. Don&#039;t place all your chips on a &quot;Maybe&quot; or wishy washy answers or give in to silly demands like her asking for money if you aren&#039;t a couple.

I went out with two but neither progressed past a second date. I eventually learned you have to fake confidence if you don\u2019t have it naturally. This was in large part thanks to matching with a 24 year old girl I could actually hold a conversation with on OKCupid. We were making out at the end of our first date (it was my 4th date ever, my first kiss, and she made the first move), then the next night she was totally naked sucking my cock in her apartment. Everything changed for me after that. Yes, she was an easy slut who had been with dozens of guys before me, but she taught me things that improved my life tenfold. I kept trading up to better, hotter girls as I got more skills talking to and bedding women. Within a few years I had fucked 25 women, far surpassing the number of girls fucked by my married friends.

If she wasn\u2019t, I probably would\u2019ve had more trouble. But lucky for me she was ready to fuck 24 hours after meeting me. Bottom line: at first, just get what you can get. Even if they\u2019re not hot. They\u2019re basically just practice dummies. Still be nice to them, but go in knowing you\u2019ll cast them aside after you get what you need. It helps a lot. Nervousness starts to melt away. Keep them at arm\u2019s length from the rear of your life, though. Don\u2019t introduce them to family or friends. Likely those early relationships won\u2019t get to those points, but be careful that they don\u2019t (unless you end up actually falling for one of the early one - which theoretically could happen, I guess). From there build up confidence and start aiming for girls you actually want to be with. You have to earn them.", "time": 1673402274, "resto": 28093107}, {"no": 28094757, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)21:03:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28094523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28094523</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wouldn&#039;t say &quot;really great&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bangs lots of hotties, young gf, fit, earns $250K</span>", "time": 1673402614, "resto": 28093107}, {"no": 28094781, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)21:07:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28094718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28094718</a><br>Thanks for the advice.

Just move and with time you get better at it because with time you stop giving a fuck. The lack of fucks given is what will make you seem like a confident dancer. Men dont have to be Good dancers, only confident.<br><br>Make eye contact with a girl a few times to confirm it wasnt like she accidentally looked your way but was really checking out some friends behind you. Smile. Dance closer towards her and spin her around some. Do it with only the intent to have fun and maybe even ignore her after and go back to her and see if shes still into dancing with you. Few words and focus on her body, does she move it closer to you when you move away, hold her hands in yours for a moment while dancing does she put them anywhere in particular after etc.", "time": 1673293130, "resto": 28077234}, {"no": 28084750, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:39:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28084710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28084710</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;10</span> ninjas show up<br>you mean those 10 ninjas, man and women alike with whom she went?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You didn&#039;t even approach them, even in your fantasies you cannot approach women.</span><br>yeah, i didnt need it because they approached me, you braindead retard<br>as for bus girl, i still speak to her and meet up with her most weeks.<br><br>your advice is not wanted, you are dumb as bricks. gtfo and let people who want to learn something new do it", "time": 1673293163, "resto": 28077234}, {"no": 28084769, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:42:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28084747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28084747</a><br>honestly, if i try lsd or shrooms it will be in the woods or in a festival. as for the rest thanks for the advice", "time": 1673293350, "resto": 28077234}, {"no": 28084783, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28084750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28084750</a><br>the ninjas didn&#039;t show up just like you didn&#039;t talk to anyone its to point you to how its a blatant lie<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i still speak to her and meet up with her most weeks.</span><br>No you don&#039;t because you never spoke to her in the bus.

I went to a therapist when I was 16 and got diagnosed with PTSD from my childhood. They also said that I wasn&#039;t autistic or had anxiety, which I do believe, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that that&#039;s making me feel different.<br><br>I act polite and &#039;normal&#039; (if a bit awkward) around people, but it&#039;s just an act. In my head, I&#039;m constantly mocking them, I have no friends and can&#039;t get close to people. When I had friends in middle school/as a kid, I&#039;d get into arguments with them every few months because I&#039;d be able to bury my issues with them for a while but couldn&#039;t go on with it for much longer. Part of me was genuinely fed up, whilst the other part of me wanted to cause trouble for the sake of it. I didn&#039;t cause much trouble outside of bullying some kids that I was jealous of, when I was very young (6/7) I stole $5 from a friend&#039;s moneybox and $20 from my parents, but that&#039;s the only &#039;crime&#039; (if you could call it that) I got into. I vividly remember writing an essay when I was about 7 where we had to make a monster and I wrote mine to be this thing that lured people into its cave and murdered them and got pulled aside by my teacher for it, there&#039;s probably more though. I have no empathy. I&#039;ll mentally laugh and bully people for any flaws, and sometimes obsessively think about how much I want to humiliate those I don&#039;t like.

The girl group disliked that as they felt we deprived them of attention and specifically celebrity. Because of the girl group there those that sought to instigate a split and exclusion in exchange of being integrated with the girl group. The girl group had no plans to uphold their end of the &quot;deal&quot; and moved the goalpost on those that instigated - more than once. Essentially the instigators were &quot;timed out&quot; and slowly were re-integrated into the core high school group with suspicion. There were other individuals that sperged out as they didnt get exclusive time with their friend(s) of choice, later those spergs became outsiders very early in high school. Essentially, there were ups and downs and incrementally as I was the go-to guy (very approachable) that began to integrate the year the year became closer and closer. We organised big bike ridding days, movie days, gaming and pizza. It wasnt until the drama with my ex gf that really divided and splintered the year. The girl group trying to restart the integration effort by using the formal/prom as a way bring everyone together again. It didnt happen, the girl group made a pact to not go to the formal/prom with in guy and to arrive separate from the guys. The last remaining group in high school tried to integrate everyone but the catch was that just wanted to make themselves desirable by having outliers and outsiders asking them to hang out.

I remember I was speaking with him about how I felt as a 23 y/o doomer, more or less, and how I wanted to be like him when I grew up (close with family, strong, dependable, etc.). He told me that I never saw him 25 years ago, that we&#039;re more alike than I thought. Good man.<br>In any case, you resolve the issue by being more masculine, obviously. That can mean a lot of things to different people. Odds are that you have your own understanding of it and know what to do already. I do not think it&#039;s unimportant to be masculine, far from it, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the meaning of life or anything either. <br>But if you long to, instead, simply accept your place, then I see no need to do anything.

The caveat here is that sexual traits are, in all mammals, more variable than other traits - by which I mean something very particular. Think about how some girls have no tits and others have massive ones; some guys have a micropeen and others have Mandingo schlongs. Comparatively, other traits - like height itself for example - are normally distributed and less variable than sexual ones. This is why it&#039;s impossible to look at a tall guy and be sure he has a big dick, but you can be reasonably sure he has big feet or hands. <br>Why are sexual traits more variable? It&#039;s hard to say. One explanation may be that the genetic code for both sexes is mostly the same, barring a single chromosome. Perhaps our genetic code can&#039;t optimize on a sex-by-sex basis because it has to be beneficial for both sons and daughters.
