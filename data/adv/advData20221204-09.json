Because I understand that work isn&#039;t a hobby. Trying to make work something you like doesn&#039;t work out, because work is something you HAVE to do, week in, week out regardless of how you feel about doing it at that time. <br><br>All you end up doing when you try to find something you like is losing something you liked. Most jobs, even ones that might not seem immediately obvious to, consist of repetitive tasks day in, day out. <br><br>Work is the thing you do when you&#039;re not living your life in order to fund the tines when you are living your life. That&#039;s why the concept of work / life balance are separate things, because work is not life. <br><br>The goal for work is quite simple. Find a thing in the highest demand, you are most proficient at/suited to, with both the best starting wage and highest wage growth potential possible. <br><br>For example, just because you have the brains to be a lawyer doesn&#039;t mean you should be one if demand for more lawyers is low or you aren&#039;t naturally very good at arguing/logical thought. <br><br>You&#039;re supposed to be playing to your strengths so you increase your income as rapidly as possible whilst remaining on fixed expenses. ie. Income goes up, expenses do not. <br><br>Now if you&#039;re the kind of person where the answer to that equation is assembly worker in a factory line, no judgement the world needs things made. You might consider trying to upskill to a related trade, but if you lack the abilities to complete an apprenticeship then it is what it is. <br><br>End of the line, no matter what job you choose the grass will always seem greener on the other side, there will always be days/weeks/months/years you resent going into work, there will always be things you dislike about the job, it will always become tedious.

Where would you draw the line?</span><br>I&#039;m completely relaxed about it.<br><br>Possibly the most important thing to understand about women is that if a woman wants to cheat on you, she&#039;ll cheat on you, and there isn&#039;t a damn thing you can do about it (short of physically locking her in the house 24/7, and the police might have something to say about that). The only viable option is to make sure she doesn&#039;t *want* to cheat on you; and the best way to do that is to be reasonably nice to her. That doesn&#039;t mean simping; but it does mean not imposing stupid restrictions on the way she lives her life when she&#039;s not around you, and making it clear that you trust her.<br><br>If you insist that she cuts off contact with her friends, she will resent you for it; and when a woman resents a man, she will cheat on him for revenge. Similarly, if you make it clear you don&#039;t trust her when when she isn&#039;t doing anything wrong, she will (rightly) feel that you are treating her unjustly, and that she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.<br><br>It works on a subtler level too. If you make it clear that you think she might cheat on you, that sends a very powerful message that you are sexually inadequate. If you were capable of satisfying all of her sexual and emotional needs yourself, you wouldn&#039;t be worrying about her cheating. The fact that you are worrying about it means that you know she can do better than you - and that will make her intensely curious about how much better than you she can do, so she&#039;ll start exploring.<br><br>Finally, any sensible woman knows that jealous men are dangerous. Men who don&#039;t want you to have male friends are men who will think you are screwing around when you aren&#039;t and put you in the hospital.

I only found out a day later that she was testing me in the whole conversation.<br><br>A few days later she came to me crying, and enraged, saying its because I dont love her and want her. That I want other girls. I told her no I just wanted a big fat pair of tits to dig my face in while fucking her lol. She laughed, but she was still mad. She says she knows because her body is small I cant reach it so I want sex with other girls. <br><br>We made up and everything was fine. but... she told me tonight, that one of the guys that hit on her, she fooled around with him. She said that when I told her I wanted another girl in the bed with us she got really hurt and vengeful, so she just said yes to everything the guy said. She said she was just going through the motions with him. I asked her to elaborate and she didnt she just said they messed around a bit. She promised now that she knows I dont want another girl that she wants to prove her commitment to me and get married within the next 2 years. So she is expecting us to be engaged. <br><br>But I feel that she is putting me on a bit and that shes trying to distract from that she probably had sex with another guy.

Sounds like you have memory issues so it will be difficult to re-discover the source of your trauma, but if you can figure it out I promise it will be worth the effort. Confronting the source of your trauma and learning how to be strong enough to move past it will work wonders for you. <br><br>Example: A girl approached me at a bar. 10/10 woman in terms of appearance. She invites me to visit her at work that weekend. When I do, she calls me a stalker and spreads this fake rumor about me to others. Months go by and I&#039;m afraid to go out again, but when I finally do, I realize the rumor didn&#039;t go very far or people didn&#039;t believe it. Nothing fucking happened, therefore I had nothing to be afraid of. Guess what? That same girl is coming onto me again only now I&#039;m strong and wise enough to know better and shun/reject her for the demon that she is.<br><br>Anyway, let&#039;s approach your original question. How do you begin truly loving yourself? You say you feel like a worthless person. Most people feel that way, I think. That&#039;s why so many resort to alcohol or drugs to fill the void in their soul. Even extremely talented people feel empty because they don&#039;t have anyone that is able to relate to them on their level. I think the key is to set your own goals and standards. If you can do that, then you have something to work toward. And it will take time, but you can certainly reach whatever goal you come up with if you make an honest effort toward it. It&#039;s not something that needs to be done by the end of the month, either. Go at your own pace; just a little bit every day will change you for the better in a year&#039;s time.<br><br>What would you like to be better at? Do you have any talents or hobbies?

But not always. There are times where you can get out of the pit of despair that is loneliness only to fuck it all up and drop right back in. That&#039;s what I did, and that&#039;s where I am. You get a taste of heaven and get promptly dropped right back into the depths of hell. But even now, while feeling what I believe to be the absolutely worst cocktail of emotions a person can feel, on par with the death of family / loved ones, I can still grasp the fact that I am not blameless, and that I am responsible for the choices I&#039;ve made and for my own fuckups.

No matter what, pain is unavoidable, that&#039;s just the way it is. Be that as it may, if you ever want to have any hope of making it better, you gotta take the reins. Stewing in agony is just gonna make everything worse. If someone&#039;s dead set on dying (no pun intended), then I wouldn&#039;t blame them for taking that route. Sometimes it really does hurt too much. But so long as you have even a tiny scrap of hope, you gotta keep chugging on. Who knows, maybe something good will happen tomorrow to turn your life around. Call me naive, but it happened to me once before, who&#039;s to say it won&#039;t happen again?

You don&#039;t have to walk up to strangers in the cafeteria, what you need to do is be kind and friendly to your upcoming classmates. Let them know that you&#039;re chill and fun. You&#039;re all young; they will be receptive to your positive attitude and want you to be in their project groups or even spend time outside of class.<br><br>If you&#039;re into sports, join one at your school. If there are ANY and I mean ANY clubs or extracurricular activities that pique your interest, give them a chance. If they end up being a waste of time, you can stop attending those clubs and no one will judge you for it. <br><br>Another thing, and this can be tricky based on your school (it&#039;s something I struggled with for three years straight). If there are any girls in your classes that you feel even a modicum of attraction towards, make an effort to talk to her as often as you can. Even if you&#039;re not crazy about her at all, if some part of you says, &quot;maybe...&quot; then fucking go for it. I say this is tricky because you might have classes where you&#039;re not allowed to speak. If you say one word, your shithead professor will kick you out. That sort of thing. In that case, any opportunity you get to talk to your cute female classmate before or after class, fucking capitalize on it. I&#039;ll be thirty next month and I still regret not putting in more of an effort with the occasional college cutie which is why I&#039;m telling you this.<br><br>I know you&#039;re anxious and afraid right now. You feel like you missed out and it&#039;s all your fault. It&#039;s okay to feel that way. I&#039;m telling you that you still have plenty of time. I promise you still have plenty of chances and opportunities but it&#039;s up to you to capitalize on them.", "time": 1670137398, "resto": 27846572}, {"no": 27848142, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)02:33:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27848021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27848021</a><br>Lurking, 19 as well in the same boat.

I exit the balcony and he is adjusting our guitar. I bring him his favourite cigaretts and he looks at me all lovingly, we make few sarcastic remarks about our kids going partying or something.
