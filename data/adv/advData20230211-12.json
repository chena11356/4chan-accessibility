I&#039;ve known this guy since we were in college but we reconnected in late September. Since then we started to date here and there. Going out for dinner, doing fun activities but I needed a real conversation about where all of this dating was going. We had spent a good amount of time with each other so I felt like i wanted clarity on where all of this was going. I had a feeling that he did not want to commit but never in a million years did I expect to hear that I was basically too &#039;&#039;old&#039;&#039;. His reasoning was that I was in my late 20s already, childless and single so my goal would be commitment and establishing a family before i would hit 30. He told me be that he needed way more time to commit to anyone and wanted to achieve some goals first and wanted experience life to the fullest before he could even think about a serious relationship. I could not believe what I was hearing. I told him that I was younger than him and that people grow together all the time (not that I was interested in growing with him after what he had said this but I was trying to make a point). He told me that even though he thought that I was pretty and smart that I would be in my 30&#039;s when he would seriously consider a serious relationship. I asked him if he was aware that he is aging too? That men age too? We ended having an ugly argument before we blocked each other. I&#039;m sitting here and contemplating if my time is really up when it comes to dating and men? What do men look for? Am i really too old for dating someone in my age range or did he just not want me? I&#039;m literally typing this with tears in my eyes. I can&#039;t control my age or time.

It&#039;s ridiculous and I guess it stems from my own insecurities. I think it stemmed from the fact that for a long time I was always the lowest, like, I wasn&#039;t good at much, the easiest to be made fun off, etc. And I tried to best myself by becoming everything that I wanted to be, which I&#039;ve been trying for about the last 4 years now, and all it&#039;s made me is angry, miserable and disappointed in myself. Maybe I&#039;m just not meant to go anywhere with my life, maybe I am better just retiring myself to being a hermit who just gets by.

I didn&#039;t play along with all the profanity and culture it was all new to me and I was called out a momma&#039;s boy, I didnt fit in, I had a few situations where the class would gang up on me, telling me everyone hated me or I had no friends, humiliation and just overall shit experience.

He attended Duke University.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He began his career working for his family office as a construction project manager building a hotel and shopping center before moving to Manhattan. He became acquainted with Hineni\u2019s Rebbitzein Ester Jungreis in 2002 and began learning more seriously about his Jewish roots. During that time, Adam learned more about frumkeit from his cousin Shemi Rokeach of the Rokeach family from Belz.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2005 Adam moved to Main Land China to develop a business venture in Guangzhou China. During the course of his 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, Adam studied Taijutsu in Japan with Dr Haatsumi Maasaki, the famed martial artist, where he earned a black belt in the art. Adam also studied kung-fu while living in the mainland.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adam moved to Jerusalem Israel in 2013 where he began learning in the Yeshiva Dvar Yerushalayim with Rosh Yeshiva Baruch Horowitz in Har Nof. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2019, Adam became the Rosh Yeshiva\u2019s hebruta and he teaches the Yeshiva\u2019s Yerushalmi gemara class.

Adam excelled in eastern martial arts for more than a decade but found that nothing in the world compares to the treasures in the Torah and Torah learning, particularly in a Yeshivish environment. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2015, Adam finished the Yerushalmi shas for the first time where the Rosh Yeshiva arranged for a sium at the home of Rabbi Kanievski to celebrate. At the sium, Rabbi Kanievski gave Adam a blessing to finish the whole Torah each year.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2016 he finished the Bavli Shas for the first time and Yerushalmi shas in 350 days, along with the Tanakh, Shulchan Aruch and Mishnah. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since then, he completes the Bavli Shas, Yerushalmi Shas, Mishnah, Shulchan Aruch, Midrash Rabbah and Tanakh each year according to a learning program arranged by Rabbi Ezriel Auerbach. In 2018, Adam was tested on the Yerushalmi Shas by the Rosh Yeshiva of Meir Yeshiva.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adam describes looking at pages of the Yerushalmi as seeing the letters sparkle, catch on fire, and then stand-up on the page and dance. He is passionate about inspiring jews to connect with the less popular jewish classics such as those by Rabbi Shlomo Ibn Gibriol and making those ideas accessible for a general audience. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2016, Adam married Edna, the niece of Rabbi Nissim Yagen, where they live in Har Nof, Jerusalem.</span>", "time": 1676112938, "resto": 28322342}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28316256, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)10:53:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How can I convince you to be vegan?", "filename": "E3y1WipVcAA4KVy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4043, "h": 3549, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 219, "tim": 1676044384522071, "time": 1676044384, "md5": "ZU313w3bI2Read9zqbXmfQ==", "fsize": 987997, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-can-i-convince-you-to-be-vegan", "replies": 147, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 39, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 28316268, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)10:55:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28316256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28316256</a><br>Use examples of animals which have a similar digestive system to humans.", "time": 1676044525, "resto": 28316256}, {"no": 28316333, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:04:13", "name": "ha ha ha", "com": "<a href=\"#p28316256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28316256</a><br>you can\u2019t. eating meat feels awesome and provides me the energy to function. i have only met one vegan in my life who wasn\u2019t a simpering retard<br><br>Better question is why do you need others to agree with your lifestyle choices?", "time": 1676045053, "resto": 28316256}, {"no": 28316339, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:04:38", "name": "Sean", "com": "<a href=\"#p28316256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28316256</a><br>Best I can do is vegetarian", "time": 1676045078, "resto": 28316256}, {"no": 28316352, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28316256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28316256</a><br>best I can do is the Orthodox fast", "time": 1676045186, "resto": 28316256}, {"no": 28316395, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)11:12:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28316333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28316333</a><br>Because a single vegan does jack shit.

When I was in school I was super mega turbo ADHD autist before people in my part of the world really understood autism so I never had a single friend and constantly had to change schools. As a teenager my mother wouldn&#039;t let me go outside by myself or do pretty much anything but sit in my room and jack off so I developed a porn addiction and severe depression. I got into a good college because I was smart enough to do well on tests but she insisted on involving herself in and micromanaging every part of my college life including picking my classes for me and managing my student email, even walking to college with me when it was time to go to class. I told her this made me feel extremely uncomfortable but she kept doing it, and I never learned how to stand up to her. She insisted I never date anyone or waste time making friends and that I become a doctor because asian so that I could make a lot of money and attract some gold digger like her instead of the kind of women I wanted to date. Eventually one day I snapped and dropped out of college, the anxiety and paranoia that she burdened me with made me a NEET for the next few years because I had 0 ability to even talk to people face-to-face without coming off as a stuttery retard. Now in my late 20s I&#039;m finally going back to college to study something I&#039;m interested in and staying in a student dorm away from my mother, things are actually going okay and I&#039;m starting to make real-life friends for the first time, even if I have to lie about my age to hide that I&#039;m a millenial and not a zoomer like them.

Putting yourself in a situation where you drink and either can&#039;t control yourself or you can&#039;t remember what happened is so insanely scary to me I don&#039;t understand why people do it in the first place let alone WHILE in a relationship AND for spring break??<br><br><a href=\"#p28317091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28317091</a><br>Truly it&#039;s your call. ESPECIALLY because this is a spring break trip which isn&#039;t the end of the world if she doesn&#039;t go compared to a bachelorette party with her best friends spring break isn&#039;t a once in a lifetime shit. If you are not comfortable with her drinking, dressing up slutty, and partying around with her friends and random people then NO ONE should fault you for that and you aren&#039;t insecure. It&#039;s a boundary you have and being comfortable is what should matter. If you or your partner is telling you to not do something because it makes you uncomfortable or you don&#039;t like it then people should respect that. Rules and boundaries in a relationship nowadays people just automatically assume you&#039;re insecure whether you are a guy or girl doesn&#039;t matter.<br><br> for sure mentally prepare yourself to break up and I would do it BEFORE Valentine&#039;s day because if you have a great time with her it&#039;s going to make you rethink all this and you&#039;ll be more hesitant because of the &#039;spark&#039;", "time": 1676054763, "resto": 28309557}, {"no": 28318180, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:44:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28317142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28317142</a><br>This blew up into a big fight last night and this is basically what she thinks vs what I told her.

Anon could you elaborate?</span><br>While protestants read from the Old Testament and New Testament they have a parareligion of the Protestant Ethic. Self-denial (which I just articulated it as keeping the devil within) has been encouraged as the protestants believe it would yield as a financial/monetary benefit being doing so. They deny themselves an urge, emotion or impluse to attain a financial/monetary benefit. They believe that the rich are blessed by God and the poorer people as cursed by God. If someone suffers the protestants at first argue that the individual that suffered is at fault and it was God punishing them. The protestants themselves scold the one that suffered as to punish them and to do &quot;God&#039;s work&quot;. By doing so they regard themselves as good protestants and thereby good people. Someone who is &quot;worthy&quot; of their appearance of affection (as expressing affection is more or less sin). <br><br>If you approach a protestant cheerfully they are likely to wonder as to the way you do our work and monetary affairs to deserve your cheerfulness. So for example, you are joyful and you talk with a devout protestant. They wonder whether you got promoted at work, got a raise or you brought something expensive. They ask you and find that you are joyful just because. They dont like you as you failed to exercise self-denial and you done nothing worthy to deserve feeling that way. I remember talking to someone from Sweden and I dont think much of that Swede&#039;s behaviour at the time, he was very uncomfortable with me being in a good mood (just because) and was getting annoyed as I was frustrating his self-denial efforts. In other words, he thought I was being very rude. <br><br>If you would like to know more (while happy to explain, elaborate as you said) the history of the Hanseatic League and the &quot;The Protestant Ethic and Spirit of Capitalism&quot; book tend to be good sources. <br><br>As for sex, she is waiting for a big payout...", "time": 1676064743, "resto": 28309010}, {"no": 28318663, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28318529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28318529</a><br>It is the same", "time": 1676065197, "resto": 28309010}, {"no": 28318683, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:42:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28309010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28309010</a><br>By overcoming the person who took your innocence and by living in the moment and not in your head/imagination like children do.<br>Deal with past baggage be free of fear and worry.<br>Do the adv and be free.<br>https://youtu.be/VjQAU1RbwBI<br>Learn to let go of thoughts.<br>https://youtu.be/aLhadnE3Kyo<br>The proper Education and Training eliminates fear and lets you achieve what you want.<br>Watch Gladiator with Russell Crowe to see what even temperament looks like.", "time": 1676065370, "resto": 28309010}, {"no": 28318707, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:45:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28309010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28309010</a><br>You don&#039;t.

With your condition being as it is I would try to rule them out altogether. In this situation your endocrine has become somewhat pathological and it&#039;s probably an entire environment&#039;s worth of factors that have brought this state about.<br><br>The endocrine system is a network of organs throughout the body all of which work to maintain a hormonal homeostasis. If even one of these organs is in stress it stresses the rest of them out as well and if the environmental issues are not resolved a pathological homeostasis takes form which creates a normal state of unhealth. The problem, once this happens, is that to break an existing homeostasis requires a sharp shock to it. So you may have to make some drastic changes in order to turn things around.<br><br>Here are a few of them, there are more but these are the most important:<br><br>Vitamin D3 deficiency is a worldwide epidemic. Vitamin D is not really a vitamin, it&#039;s a prohormone and it plays myriad of roles throughout the entirety of our organism. You may want to get a blood test which tests for both the active and inactive form of vitamin D to see where your levels really are. Regardless, with most people being deficient I strongly suggest supplementing with 5000-10,000IU a day especially during the winter and the times where you&#039;re not getting sunlight. Vitamin D3 should be taken with K2 as vitamin K2 ensures that the vitamin-d associated calcium ends up where it&#039;s needed and not in the areas where it can induce trouble. As for a supplement, I recommend the Dr. Berg brand as it&#039;s the cheapest combo with U.S. made ingredients.", "time": 1676082338, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320800, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320794</a><br>The liver is a secondary organ in the endocrine system but its role should not be written off. When you take NSAIDs regularly, which is particularly common for women with painful menstrual cycles, you begin to deteriorate your liver&#039;s capacity. Since you&#039;re having so many recurring migraines I can only imagine how often you rely on these to get through the day. To stop taking them is probably not an option, nor would I want you to suffer. But what you should do is chase every NSAID with at least 600mg of N-Acetyl-Cysteine, preferably Pure Encapsulations brand as they&#039;re a U.S. manufacturer that doesn&#039;t use Chinese ingredients. NAC helps replete the master antioxidant glutathione within your liver which NSAIDs rapidly deplete. Chronic use of NSAIDs will keep your liver in a perpetual state of unhealth by suppressing glutathione levels which can, over time, exacerbate and further allow this pathological homeostasis of your endocrine system to persist.<br><br>From what I&#039;m observing based off what you have provided you are expressing multiple symptoms of estrogen dominance. This can be overcome but to break the current homeostasis requires a shock. The strongest shock you can provide, in my opinion, is fasting. I think a 3 a day water fast every month for 4-6 months might be exactly what you need to start recovering. If you are the type of person that eats three meals a day you may want to work yourself to one meal a day before going for a three day fast. To go from three meals a day to no meals a day is really difficult for people doing their first multi-day fast. You can do it, it&#039;s just more stress on the body than it would be if you were already eating one meal a day.", "time": 1676082399, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320807, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320800</a><br><br>Second, you&#039;re going to want to get an intracellular magnesium and potassium test as these are the electrolytes that are most often related to estrogen dominance and glandular function. You need to specifically ask for an intracellular test for these electrolytes as they are intracellular electrolytes (98-99% are within your cells). If you rely upon a blood serum test you&#039;re not going to be able to adequately diagnose a deficiency until its in its latest stages. For some, magnesium can make migraines worse so use caution with them. I would start with magnesium glycinate and then work from there if that form of Mg induces migraines. Try to find a form of magnesium that does not stimulate migraines if you can, don&#039;t give up if the first brand/type you try induces them. For potassium I recommend buying Dr. Berg&#039;s electrolyte powder as it has 1000mg of potassium (4,700mg is the recommended daily intake) per scoop. It&#039;s the most affordable way to supplement with potassium that I have found. Most potassium in the diet comes from vegetables so you may want to try to figure out how much you need to supplement with to ensure you&#039;re meeting your dietary requirement. <br><br>Third thing you&#039;re going to want to do is clear the body out of heavy metals which you have been accumulating throughout your life. The safest way to do this is by way of Modified Citrus Pectin. 5mg/3x/day for 1 month (PectaSol / Econeugenics brand) should clear the majority of what can be cleared out minus what has been sequestered in bone of course.

Bottled water inevitably leaches chemicals from the plastics even if it&#039;s a BPA-free plastic. I recommend dropping money on a distilled water system and adding your own trace minerals to it or using electrolyte powders to get the needed electrolytes. The brand of distiller I recommend is the My Pure Water brand:<br><br>https://mypurewater.com/shop/mini-c<wbr>lassic-ct-distiller/<br><br>I own this one myself and it&#039;s a great machine; it&#039;s easy to maintain and only requires a once a month cleaning to keep going. If you&#039;re making soups, broths or use water for boiling to make rice/pasta then I would also invest in an undersink filter to filter out your municipal water, especially fluoride which is notorious for wreaking havoc to the endocrine system (I&#039;ll get to fluoride more in a second). The system I use is this one: <br><br>https://www.amazon.com/Frizzlife-SK<wbr>99-NEW-Certified-Chlorine-Chloramin<wbr>e/dp/B08NDYVZV5/<br><br>As for fluoride, I would immediately stop using fluoride toothpastes. I would also be mindful of any canned foods packed in water (often packed in municipal fluoridated water) and if you can get a flouride-rated shower filter that would be helpful as well. The problem with fluoride is that it accumulates as it&#039;s readily retained at a rate of 35% - 50% of that which is ingested (younger people retaining more than adults). And when fluoride gets retained it gets sequestered in bone. The presence of iodine triggers its release and removal and there has been some brewing hypotheses regarding using iodine as a way of treating long-term fluoride toxicity.", "time": 1676082521, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320819, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:29:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320641</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m pretty sure the director would never admit to that</span><br>How have you not seen the video?

Remember this: All the &quot;unattractive&quot; people you see in the world are carrying the genetics of hundreds of years of &quot;ugly&quot; people getting laid. Unattractive people have sex, you just need to know how to talk to a girl and have realistic standards.
