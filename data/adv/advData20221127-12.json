I officially met her last night at a rave even though I&#039;ve no doubt met her before; I meet a million women a night and rarely remember them. I bought molly from her and then got to know her at an afterparty where she smoked all of her weed with me. Hitting on women is second nature to me so as we were talking I jokingly asked her, &quot;Do you want to marry me?&quot; and she said yes. I ask this of every woman I meet and it always works but this chick seems to have been outright swept up by it. Long story short I took her home, cooked for her (as you would), had sex, all good - except today she called me over at her place and basically cared for me as if we were married. Non-stop sex, she cooked for me as well, and seems to try her utter hardest to win me over. Not to talk about a weird obsession to sexually satisfy (and drain) me. It feels as if she&#039;s fallen in love even though I&#039;ve only really known her for a day (I&#039;d like to mention I&#039;m popular and also wanted by women in the rave scene - she told me she&#039;s kept an eye out for me for a really long time). I keep saying kink shit like, &quot;I want to fill you with my sperm,&quot; and, &quot;I own you and I want to impregnate you,&quot; and she seems to be... really... really into it. I&#039;m getting the strong impression this chick literally wants me to bust in her gut and give her a child.<br>My question and plea for advice is: what do older, ideally more experienced anons think about this? I barely know this chick and she&#039;s literally doing everything she can to be &quot;wife material.&quot; Her whole face lights up for me and she enjoys cuddling up next to me so much it&#039;s tremendously bizzarre.

It&#039;s a falacious argument born from a mentality that only considers your own perspective and experience. For everyone you can point to that you perceive has better than you, has more than you, they too have their own unique circumstances, life history, problems, and are also looking at another&#039;s situation, pining to have what they have. The truth is that there is no easy experience of life. There is no hidden formula to happiness, no guarantees of contentment, only opportunities to learn and fail and do better next time. Trying is what makes a triumph; victory and success cannot be handed to you, and especially not happiness or fulfillment, they are earned and given meaning through the endurance of trials and overcoming of challenges. What you must want for yourself is not the end result of such experiences, but the strength to embark on them, the courage to endure them, and the wisdom to learn from them. What carries value is not the reward, but the lessons you learn from the attempt. That is the real prize, and, again, nobody can give it to you. I promise you, that if you challenge yourself, give yourself opportunity, have empathy for yourself and others, and simply try as hard as you can as often as you can to elevate yourself and your circumstances, the bounty you earn from the effort you put in will feel like a Kingdom&#039;s treasure, regardless of its value as perceived by others. That is the true mark of success, and it&#039;s wholly within your power to attain it. You must not envy those who have more, but learn from them, consider them as humans such as yourself, with only circumstance and effort marking the differences between you and them. Chad doesn&#039;t envy others who have more, not because he has it all, but because he has what he has by having earned it through will alone, and knows that this is what is truly worthwhile in life.", "time": 1669569058, "resto": 27802379}], "last_modified": 1669569058}, {"no": 27802236, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)05:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;20 year old guy</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;khv until recently</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;finally had sex</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cuddling and kissing and all that was amazing, but the actual penetration felt like nothing</span><br><br>at first i thought i had some kind of erectile dysfunction or some shit, cuz jerking off has always felt good. but after jerking off at home (for science) i noticed that i feel nothing if i stroke at the same rate i would when inside a woman, but if i absolutely beat the fuck out of my dick i actually feel really good.<br><br>how can i enjoy sex the same way i do masturbation? did i just fuck myself up by being a coomer in my teenage years?", "filename": "edaters", "ext": ".png", "w": 1134, "h": 1312, "tn_w": 216, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669543262680627, "time": 1669543262, "md5": "0LRF3HyXskOJtAG1hTAa0w==", "fsize": 855645, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "20-year-old-guy", "replies": 16, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 11, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 27803315, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)10:51:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27802296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27802296</a><br>People have their own tastes and sensitivities.
