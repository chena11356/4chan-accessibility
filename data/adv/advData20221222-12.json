The big one was just her views of interpersonal effort... but there were tons of lesser ones too that combined.<br><br>Sex was one of them. Before, I&#039;d only had one sexual experience, which was going to a gay club hoping that at least maybe someone would like me. That didn&#039;t work out and I never really brought it up with anyone since. To the point at a party where a girl did get interested in me, I panicked enough to climb out a window to GTFO. I ended up using THAT story as my &#039;I was silly in college&#039; story vs the &#039;I blew a dude probably way too old for me just so I could maybe feel attractive/liked but also because I was too scared to evac at that point cuz I was basically a fucking kid&#039;. <br><br>So Ex was the first person to kinda break through the other stuff. I even ended up in a threesome after that. But she&#039;d been with at least 7 other dudes before me in the path of dating. The feeling of insecurity was always there, and became much more prevalent as time went on. After the first few times where she took the lead, I kept at it. Being desired meant much more to me than the actual sex. And then the frequency just kept dropping. And I guess I got more and more desperate in the lack of other intimacy and kept initiating, or rather trying. She focused on getting married while simultaneously not having time for any of the talks I wanted to have to try and handle any of the issues because &#039;there&#039;s always going to be issues&#039;.<br>And so we&#039;re broken up, and I&#039;m still torn apart having done so. I still care so much about her, but I could basically see the future where we&#039;re both fucking miserable with each other regardless for our love for each other independent of other factors.

Let me be clear, I&#039;m saying you&#039;re wrong. Those who are spiritually awakened will, almost universally, arrive at the same or similar conclusions--despite practicing distinct and different religions and philosophy. They all arrive at some of the same universal truths with respects to worthwhile pursuits. In other words, they reach a consensus despite running separate studies. The experiment of the human condition has been ran by multiple independent groups throughout documented history, and they arrive at the same place with respects to what is and what is not meaningful to pursue. This points to objectivity in what is meaningful and what isn&#039;t. However, this truth is resisted by unfulfilled people who will cope and convince themselves they are happy and content when they are not. Press them on it, though, and you&#039;ll find they are not as content as they claim to be. They&#039;re not trying to convince *you* when they say they are content. No, they&#039;re trying to convince themselves most of all. They need to maintain the illusion...even if it is such that it shatters under the slightest of cross-examination. It&#039;s too rooted belief to be unearthed even by Truth.<br><br>Are you aware that you and I have had nearly this exact conversation before? Coincidentally it also happened where you jumped in as a 3rd party. It involved a discussion of the stoic concept of the dichotomy of control, ie internal and external desires and aversions. It also progressed toward a discussion of the &quot;right&quot; things to pursue, and our conversation there likewise devolved into you seeing nihilism within a concept that was, apparently, nuanced to a point beyond your comprehension.

Maybe there are things that are popular that you just can&#039;t seem to find enjoyable. Expose yourself to those things FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT SOMETHING IS THERE AND YOU&#039;RE SOMEHOW MISSING IT. It&#039;s easy to find fault in things. Force-feed yourself things that the people around you seem to enjoy until something clicks. <br><br>That&#039;s how I got into metal music. A few of my friends in high school liked it, and I respected that. However, I was always the first to be like &quot;how can you enjoy that, you can&#039;t even understand what they&#039;re saying?&quot; So I looked up some artists that I knew my friends listened to, and spent one evening listening to their songs. I thought to myself, &quot;ok, this is supposed to be the artists of these genres that sound good, let&#039;s try to find the value in it.&quot; <br><br>That night, after many many songs, I discovered a new energy within myself. That music felt empowering. It&#039;s not the greatest music genre there is. Definitely not the kind of thing you play at a party, or a funeral, or a ceremony. But, it does have its place, and I found a place for it by having an open mind.<br><br>I feel like it was a lot easier to have that perspective on the music when it wasn&#039;t forced on me. By that I mean, I didn&#039;t ask anyone what artists I should listen to, nor what songs. That way, there was no pressure to have a concrete answer (either I loved it or hated it), I could be unsure how I felt about it, and not have to have a &quot;report&quot; ready for that person within a day.<br><br>The bottom line is that you should try to take interest in the things your peers find interesting, and unless you have a good reason not to, you shouldn&#039;t rebel against the conformity of liking things everyone else likes.

A lot of people (especially women who become pregnant) deal with trauma from the way they were born themselves, and it causes a deep fear of pregnancy and birth. Most of the time these fears are so subconscious that the person is not even fully aware of them, yet they dictate all their decisions surrounding pregnancy and birth.<br><br>She and you might both benefit from learning more about birth itself. Start with your own births. How were each of you born? Talk to your parents. Get your birth stories, if you have never heard your own birth story before. Your wife might have been born very traumatically, her mother may have had a very difficult pregnancy... all of these things leave lasting impacts on people. My cousin, for ex, was born after 40 hour traumatic labor and they violently pulled her out with forceps. Today she nears 30 years old and is terrified of having children. Most of us, born in western country, were born at hospital and our mothers had traumatic experiences, and that trauma stays with us and informs how we feel regarding pregnancy and birth, whether we feel &quot;safe&quot; or not.<br><br>If this sounds like something that you think would be helpful, I highly recommend utilizing the resources at Indie Birth Association <br>https://indiebirth.org/<br><br>Fear is a huge issue for women in pregnancy and birth.

It really sucks because it feels like Shit if the women you love and used to have sex and fun stops wanting it with you and isnt aroused. I got rejected Like 6-7 times in a row and it really made me depressed and insecure. Then i started googleing to find Out there are a Lot of similar Situations out there. Most women seem to loose their lust also related to bad smelling or feeling not well. Before there wasnt an issue, now she often tells me its hard for her to even kiss me because i stink out of my mouth lmao. The best you can do is just give her time and dont try to force it. Also tried it, and it wasnt fun she was crying while we had sex and i felt like a raptist... Most women reported their lust came Back later in pregnancy Like in the 4/5/6 month If youre lucky. Just stay Strong and try to use your hand in the meanwhile. Never thought having a pregnant girlfriend could lead to this Shit but Here WE are and youre Not the only one.

On a boat I both hang out in the club and go around the whole boat for women playing on arcade machines or slot machines etc. In clubs I have hung out on the dance floor a lot but not many girls have shown interest on the dance floor so I think it&#039;s a waste of time. I will hang out a lot in the smoking room from now on, it&#039;s the best place. Haven&#039;t approached in the bar of a club but one time a pair of girls showed interest in me when I was just standing beside the water pitchers on the bar. One approach I did in a club was on the edge of the dance floor, got rejected. I think that time I had been hesitating too much and they might have seen it. You&#039;re not supposed to wait when you see a girl or a set of girls you like, 3-second-rule. I also did some approaches that weren&#039;t proper. Tapped one girl on the dance floor on the shoulder on two separate occasions, held my beer over to one girl on the dance floor, walked up to a girl playing a slot machine and she totally ignored me. (might be counted as a proper approach) Maybe she was deaf because there were a bunch of deaf people on the boat.", "time": 1671683205, "resto": 27955148}, {"no": 27962408, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:29:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27962398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27962398</a><br>Also another not proper approach was I turned toward a girl on the dance floor.

I had a girl approach me on the dance floor by coming up and dancing in front of me and either she or I talked, don&#039;t remember. Dance floor is mostly just body language. Really the only place you can do a proper approach in a club is the smoking room, or if they have some relatively quiet section of the club, or outside the club. By proper I mean you go up to her and say something. I tried that with the 2-set on the edge of the dance floor, but they could barely hear me anyway. On the dance floor you are pretty much limited to body language only, maybe some shouting into the ear. Mystery says in The Mystery Method that the dance floor is not a good place to approach. You can hang out there part of the time and see if some girl gives clear signs of interest, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a good idea to hang out on the dance floor and &quot;approach&quot; women there.

Not sure how attractive the old woman was but I don&#039;t think she was attractive. Anyway I have a kind of fetish lately that I want to fuck a woman about 60 years old. Maybe it&#039;s because I made out with a 50 year old and I didn&#039;t really think 50 year olds could be as hot as she was or have as good tits as she had. I could probably have fucked her if I hadn&#039;t sperged out in texting. I&#039;ve seen some hot 60 year olds. The old woman on the dance floor don&#039;t know how old she was, maybe over 60.

However, the idea of living off your savings for several years may not be the best solution. There are other alternatives that you can pursue before completely giving up. <br><br>The first thing you should do is to take a break and focus on getting physically and mentally healthier. Take some time off to get some rest, practice meditation and mindfulness, and prioritize your social life and friendships. These activities can help you gain control of your emotions and manage your stress. <br><br>The second thing you can do is look for jobs that you can do from home. Although learn2code may seem to be the only option right now, there are actually a lot of options available on the internet today. You can look into working as a virtual assistant, doing data entry, writing or blogging, and many more. You just have to be creative and do your research. <br><br>Lastly, you can also look into other possibilities, such as starting a business or finding a job that you can do while traveling. This way, you can take control of your life and build a future where you don&#039;t have to rely on savings and can actually enjoy yourself. <br><br>It may seem impossible at the moment, but if you are determined and committed, you can make it work.

What can help is to talk to your partner and let them know how their behavior makes you feel. Being open and honest about your feelings could help to build trust and understanding between the two of you.

No wonder there are so many incels, as MEN ARE THIS FUCKING RETARDED TO OSTRACIZE WOMEN WITH NORMAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOR NO REASON. If a woman does not get married it is normal for her to have the number of partners you said your girlfriend has had. Because women, too, get dumped. And they too, need to have sex life, preferably relationships, not to end up as social outcasts, as no one wants to be friend of a loser who has no sex life. And if you haven&#039;t got friends irl, to post pictures of on your social media page, you won&#039;t have following, and if you haven&#039;t got that, you won&#039;t be hired by anyone either. As no one follows a loser with no friends and no one hires a loser with no following.

It never actually is. The definition of work is the trading of labour, skills and experience for money. This is an important definition because it reminds us that work isn&#039;t the living of life, it&#039;s the thing we do to afford to live our life inbetween working hours. <br><br>Here&#039;s the thing about work, no matter what you do once the novelty wears off you will resent it and grow to dislike it. This happens because work is a thing you have to do even when you don&#039;t want to. Work isn&#039;t a hobby, it&#039;s not something you&#039;re going to love every day. Work is work. Enjoyment and passion are for life, not for work. <br><br>Right now you&#039;re feeling disillusioned because according to you, you mostly sit around watching YouTube and playing video games. That is to say, you don&#039;t see in a meaningful way how your efforts contribute to or create anything. Sure you get to see your part of the code working, but you apparently aren&#039;t spending the majority of your work hours doing that so it makes your time feel meaningless and valueless. It robs you of purpose. <br><br>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the job that&#039;s the problem, I think it&#039;s the fact you exploit the situation to slack off instead of doing your work, putting in 110% and giving your role meaning. <br><br>You can go sell lamps and it&#039;ll be fun at the outset because it&#039;s new, but the novelty will wear off and you&#039;ll be right back to square one.", "time": 1671630483, "resto": 27958472}, {"no": 27958516, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)08:49:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27958503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27958503</a><br><br>He&#039;s the paranoid moron off his meds who&#039;s been going around for weeks acting as if the world is going to end.

I graduated college about 6 months ago and moved away for work, but she is still finishing her degree and we have been long distance until she can move to be with me. At my job however, I have met GF B, she is very religious, very outgoing, full of life and just has more personality, and I have totally fallen for her, despite still loving GF A. But, eventually, I have to break up with one of them, hence my dilemma.<br><br>I think what is really pulling me towards to GF B is how much more personality she has, with GF A, I can just do whatever I want and say whatever I want to her and she&#039;ll never really push back or be anything but submissive and I thought that was what I wanted. But GF B isn&#039;t like that, she&#039;s got her own opinions and I can have better conversations with her and I think I&#039;m finding that a lot more fulfilling in a relationship.<br><br>As far as more objective metrics go:<br>GF A was a virgin until me and GF B wants to wait until marriage to have sex so neither is a whore and sexual experience isn&#039;t much of a deciding factor in this case, though, GF A does have a little bit more experience in that realm. <br>GF A is white and GF B is Asian, GF B is also more naturally athletic and will probably age better. I think overall, I find GF B more physically attractive. <br>The main thing going for GF A is that she&#039;s definitely the safer option and I know what she brings, she&#039;s like a warm old jacket to me, but I&#039;m also in my early 20s so it is the time in my life that I can afford to gamble a bit.<br><br>Well, anons, what do you think?
