Maybe he doesn&#039;t care about you. Maybe he does but is just a bit useless - forgetful, bad at organising things. Maybe the two of you like to express affection in very different ways: I don&#039;t know if you have tried one of those &quot;love languages&quot; quizzes, but different things matter more to different people - some are more focused on physical affection (touch and hugs), some on some on doing things for the person they love (&quot;acts of service&quot;), some on material gifts, some on verbal declarations, some on spending &quot;quality time&quot; together, etc. It could be that the ways the two of you tend to express affection aren&#039;t very compatible with what you both want.<br><br>But what I think you should be asking is, does it actually *matter* what the explanation is?

So, regardless of what the explanation is, it seems very likely that things are going to continue the way they&#039;ve been going up to this point, and you&#039;re thing to continue to be unsatisfied.<br><br>So, you aren&#039;t happy, and things probably aren&#039;t going to change. Doesn&#039;t that mean you would be better off leaving your bf and being with someone else who gives you the things that you need? And isn&#039;t that true irrespective of why he&#039;s behaving like this? I don&#039;t think it matters very much *why* your bf is not giving you what you need; all that matters is that he isn&#039;t, and that probably isn&#039;t going to change.

And there are negatives about being with the wrong guy. One thing that does significantly concern me about your original post is the part about him denying that the two of you agreed to do something when you clearly did. There are several possible malevolent explanations for this; there are some others that just involve him being really forgetful or a bit of an idiot; but either way, the psychological impact on *you* is not trivial. Practically, this is what people call &quot;gaslighting&quot;. It is possible that he didn&#039;t consciously intend it that way; but the effect on you is going to be exactly the same either way. It might seem odd to say that someone can be &quot;unintentionally abusive&quot;, but they actually can - I&#039;ve been in a relationship that was like that - and in the long term, the impact on you of him doing things like that will be quite severe.<br><br>Obviously, I don&#039;t know you, and there&#039;s a limit to what I can figure out about you from a few paragraphs; but from what I can tell, I think it&#039;s very likely that you underestimate yourself, and that you would, in fact, find it easier to find a decent man to be with than you think you would.

I usually drink some vodka at home before heading out to call my nerves, and once I get to the bar/club (much easier in a bar to converse), I usually sit in a table and scope out the area. Once I finish my first drink, I approach the bar and make conversation with the bartender (can be literally about anything, this is to make it seem like you&#039;re friendly to the people around you, smile when you can and throw in a couple laughs here and there). Once I get my drink, if there&#039;s anyone near me I find attractive/approachable, I do the same thing. I just go up to them and compliment their looks, ask their opinion on something random, or just ask if I can join them and offer to pay for a round (surprisingly, this will oftentimes get you drinks paid for by them). You just have to get out there and do something. Staying couped up in your place nets you a zero percent chance of talking to someone and getting laid.

Some fetishes I have are clearly harmful yet it seems impossible to endlessly feed my taste for them.</span><br>I think I may have been in your boat. I used to have a big fixation on humiliating femdom, and would go out of my way looking for women who&#039;d humiliate me online. Problem is, I&#039;d get deeper and deeper into it and kinda convinced myself that I deserved the humiliation, and that I wasn&#039;t good enough for real relationships/sex, just being humiliated online. So yeah, not exactly an healthy fetish, but it was also a product of pre-existing insecurities.<br>I got out of it by cutting it off. Literally, one day I stopped talking to all women online, deleted all the accounts I used etc. I also toned down the porn, first of all I kinda forced myself to just watch non-fetish stuff for a while.<br>Later I kinda fell back into the porn, but it wasn&#039;t as bad as before, cause by that time I&#039;d had real normal sex (and shown myself I was capable of it), a real normal relationship, and I had kinda showed myself I could live without it.<br>A while ago I decided I didn&#039;t need the porn anymore, and just got rid of all the porn altogether. I haven&#039;t seen any porn in months and I don&#039;t miss it, though I don&#039;t think I could have done it right from the start. So I guess what worked for me was taking multiple, drastic steps. Not going cold turkey, cause that can be too harsh. No baby steps either, cause I had to feel a difference.<br>I guess it really depends on what&#039;s your unhealthy fetish/habit, though.

As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1582240546272", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1676303983871466, "time": 1676303983, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 28339821}, {"no": 28340150, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)11:08:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28339821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28339821</a><br>try leaving everything behind and move to a closeted Amish community since you seem to be a christian", "filename": "Hi.

It was at college and I worked as a student helper for a class. There was this girl in the class that would ask for a lot of help and was over the top nice to me. She would do things that I would definitely consider way outside of &quot;normal&quot; nice. My initial impression of her was that this girl just had a bubbly nice personality, but as the semester progressed she kept doing way over the top &quot;nice&quot; things. This lead to my impression to change from &quot;oh, shes just a nice girl&quot; to &quot;oh, shes just sucking up for a grade&quot;.

I even started wondering if she was just using me as a therapist. I don&#039;t remember who asked for whos number but eventually we had eachothers phone number and she would send walls of text messages to me with again over the top &quot;niceness&quot;, and would continually do over the top &quot;nice&quot; things in person. Nothing physical.<br><br>It honestly got to the point where I felt very annoyed with her.

I went on a date with her and found her mannerisms cute. She&#039;s shy, quiet, smart, maybe even autistic lol. But in typical fashion I could easily make her laugh so we connected personally. I have never been particularly attracted to her, besides her face, she&#039;s cute. It ended up she would just stay over at my place (a camper) often because she didn&#039;t like being at home (her trailer where her family lives is gross desu). The problem is that now we&#039;re living in an apartment together. I&#039;m hoping to buy my dad&#039;s house at the end of the year and then maybe me and her can be friends.... it&#039;s sad because I almost think of God punishing me in a way. It&#039;s like you get what you need not what you want I guess. She&#039;s great and desu I would stay with her much longer if she just was more physically attractive. Unfortunately she isn&#039;t. I&#039;m not some Chad but I could at least pull a chubby big titty girl for sure. <br><br>We have good sex too but yeah it&#039;s just like the heart wants what the heart wants. Honestly I was living with a girl in 2015 and kind of had a similar problem where I couldn&#039;t stop wanting to fuck other women. Ended up leaving her and it really fucked me up. I fucked around from 2016 all the way til now and even capitulated to just being a bachelor. Life&#039;s fucked up and really not so simple people wanting me to just break up with her I can&#039;t because we have a lease together. I don&#039;t plan on doing it this year and who knows maybe we&#039;ll stay together longer but I really just wanted to hear some opinions from people. Good to know I&#039;m not the only one. And another thing is I didn&#039;t really know this was what I wanted til we got together. Then dating her a few months I realized what I wanted.

He was basically screaming for help and I kind of just ignored him and told myself that he can deal with it and left it at that. This is where my regret is. We are discussing now the best way to move forward as I know he may likely cheat in the future obviously. I don\u2019t want him to but this is just my reality, he is hoping that we can work something out. I know he was struggling as he has a very high sex drive. Maybe we can work something out where we get tested. I know he was at least responsible enough to not get an std as we have both been tested and nothing came back so I was happy about that. I just hate the idea of him being with another woman but I also can at least see where he is coming from as to why he did it. Like I said as long as he doesn\u2019t leave his family which I truly don\u2019t think he ever will and as long as he doesn\u2019t give me an std then I don\u2019t think him having a girl on the side is the worst thing ever.

Why is it such as issue? I&#039;ve been reading &#039;Rational Recovery&#039; which is mostly about alcohol, but that book inspired stuff like easypeasy, so the method can be applied to anything: porn, drugs, alcohol, social media. The gist is that you have to recognize any desire to drink or use as not actually being a part of you, but as a voice of the midbrain, the less developed part of your animalistic brain, which contacts with your neocortex, and gives it various ideas. Basically, you give your full consent to act on your impulses, while being nudged by this primitive desire. The key is to recognize the voice in your head, with all its little copes and justifications (ex: im so lonely, only drinking will help me). I tried this method, and discovered something peculiar about myself...my thinking process is completely fucked due to years of daydreaming, i dont think like a normal human anymore. I dont think like most normal beings do, reflecting on their present with their inner monologue. Instead, my inner voice is solely focused on various random scenarios in my head (&quot;oh, what if i asked that cutie shy girl, and it suddenly turns out that she really like fallout, just like me, wouldnt that be awesome?!&quot; ). So i think you can see the problem here. I cant exactly detect the primitive voice, if i dont have it. My actions are mostly automated, with my voice being occupied by random shit. I seek your advice, for i feel desperate. Has anyone been dealing with the same problem? im trying to genuinely look for an answer without havning to see a therapist, but that seems like my only option at this point.

(I didn&#039;t figure myself out till I was 21 and that was only thanks to some very odd situations I got into) Mainly because there are different types of people so different diets work differently. We keep acting like one diet will fix everyone, but one size fits all is clearly wrong. <br> <br>It&#039;s not just calories, its type of calories and other things your body needs. Calorie restriction is too abstract to be useful as it only looks at total energy, heck it doesn&#039;t even consider how the calories are absorbed or what things your body needs to use them for. I recommend finding a ratio of Fat, Carb and Protein they works with your body. Along with a powdered multi vitamin to help supplement given how nutrition poor most food is today. And eating fresh and organic foods as processing adds lots of stuff everyone should avoid. <br><br>General things like avoiding sugar helps a lot for most people, but few understand how much sugar is really in our foods, its very hard to avoid. Pic is some common ratios for bodybuilders as they understand how macro nutrition ratios effect how their body reacts, granted each person is unique but its a good place to start. Keto is hard for many to get started, so a more gradual transition can help. <br><br>In most cases I believe the reason many keep having a craving to eat is they haven&#039;t given their body what it wants. For example lets say your diet lacks X, well your body will keep telling you to eat till it gets X, so eating an endless amount of Y doesn&#039;t help you at all. Most diets are just some reformulation of a macro nutrition ratio, which works really well for like 10% of people. It gets picked up by the mainstream, then later gets dropped when people find it hurts the other 90%, because different people have different dietary needs.", "filename": "macro-math-3-keys-to-dialing-in-your-macro-ratios-v2-2-700xh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 263, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 46, "tim": 1676356327119460, "time": 1676356327, "md5": "je3PFI4BV9qsBwpRcl/1Eg==", "fsize": 28838, "resto": 28340696}, {"no": 28346485, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:48:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28346410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28346410</a><br>after Macro Nutrition (fat, carb, protein) and Nutrition (vitamins and minerals) you&#039;ll find other factors you&#039;ll also need to figure out like<br>Hydration (getting enough water)<br>Sleep cycles (sleeping enough and in regular intervals)<br>Microbiome (making sure you have the good bacteria in you body to help you)<br>Bowel moments (how often you use the bathroom and what does it look like, it&#039;s a bit gross but it tells you a lot that can help)<br>Exercise Muscle (building muscles makes your body burn more fat as you have more muscles mass that needs energy, this helps with weight loss but can increase your total weight as muscle adds on)<br>Exercise Cardio (this helps with energy levels and body regulations, not as big for weight loss but a minimum is needed to be healthy overall) <br>Lifestyle stress (both emotional and chemical, these are hard to pin down but if you have stress your body is basically posing itself as it panics even if you don&#039;t notice) <br><br>The order and priority is debatable, but each one can trigger good results and getting these all down and more really helps. remember their is not simple answer, you are an insanely complex bio engine so figuring out how to fix you is not going to be simple.
