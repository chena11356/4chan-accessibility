I wont have support since all homes around me are being rented, with the owners far away from here, police wont listen to me, everyone incluiding my family dismisses me, and I&#039;ve had a headache for the entire year.

I feel so helpless. If I had money of any kind Id soundproof my whole house, put some plants to mask the dog-shit smell, and buy the biggest, crappiest speakers around to fire up heavy metal everytime their dog barks till they learn to be quiet, but even going to a flea market is beyond my means at the moment.

I have also gotten off cross-dressing in real life, but I&#039;ve never really gotten off to pictures or videos of this online because a sort of basic-rationality filter means only dumb, sickly and obese people publically post this behavior. Sissy porn is almost always equivalently disgusting. I also have maintained normal attraction for and the ability to get an erection for normal females. I have had a long-term relationship with a normal girl, and never had trouble getting it up. So what the fuck is wrong with me? Anyone else ridiculously deep down a hole of some mysterious childhood fetish? Is engaging with this stuff in reality bound to send me down a hedonistic hellhole? Or should I just enjoy the only life I have and balance this with a normal, intellectual life?

Addiction is addiction. I might have been unclear though: I am totally interested in actual sex, &quot;the way God intended it&quot;. I desire to have completely vanilla experiences like this on a regular basis with a partner. And to respond to the last bit: in high school I got swept into the early life stages of the NoFap trend and refrained from PMO for about 120 days. During this time I got a girlfriend and became busy with so many fulfilling challenges, responsibilities and friends. I had totally forgotten about this fetish.

To me, a fetish is a sufficient and unusual condition for turning somebody on, not a necessary and unusual condition. That&#039;s my bad for misusing the language though.

Yeah, maybe I&#039;d make it in the short-term, but I always imagine that 5,10, or even 20 years down the line the curiosity and passion would probably break me into wanting to engage with it, and breaking a promise like that could fatally hurt a relationship or marriage.<br><br>Hopefully that clears it up.

There is also an aspect of attention and care here when someone helps you dress up, just like the ASMR you might get from a haircut or massage.<br>- I have always loved customization and personalization in all its forms: in video games, on devices, decorating, and so on. There is definitely some truth to the age-old whining that men&#039;s fashion is &quot;boring&quot; compared to women&#039;s fashion. At a basic level, I just enjoy dress-up, and assuming a female form makes this even more involved and fun then the incongruence of plain crossdressing.<br>- I&#039;ve always been into textures (velvet, silk, plush, etc.) and tight clothing. This goes hand in hand with the suit-up process as well as putting on female clothing on top of this, which obviously has way more of these kinds of things than male clothing.<br>- I feel secure about my masculinity, and I often feel so disgusted by the distorted, machismo image of masculinity (beards, cars, bellies, suits, intimidation, etc.) that I think I end up fleeing all the way to being as feminine and cute as possible, almost to prove a point. The ideal man to me is the athletic soccer player, dancer, or general fit twink\u2014not a hulking lumberjack, football player, or roided bodybuilder.<br>- The acting aspect seems so fun and freeing", "time": 1671922254, "resto": 27974689}, {"no": 27979328, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)21:53:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27978514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27978514</a><br>Thanks for indulging me <a href=\"#p27978233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27978233</a><br><a href=\"#p27975552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975552</a>.

The only difference between you and me is that you\u2019re straight, but I\u2019m pan sexual. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, nor does there need to be a deep rooted reason for why you like it. I got into kigurumi before I even started watching anime, I also like body suits and latex without there being some event linked to why I do, I just like it, the same way you might like a genre of music or a certain colour.

Getting into the habit of being busy with people and hobbies helps calibrate to the natural balance, but even in times where my days were packed, I still would jerk off ritually every night before sleeping. It&#039;s like getting used to eating dessert--you start to count on getting one more fun thing before the day ends--a brief escape before returning to responsibilities of the next day. I also understand why you might be concerned that it&#039;s one of the only things I allow myself. You&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;well if that&#039;s the only simple gratification you allow yourself, you&#039;re just going to end up doing it more and with more intensity to compensate, dumbass&quot;. The thing is, while I&#039;ve been straight edge in terms of drugs my whole life, I&#039;ve only recently cut down on the more subtle traps such as watching lots of YouTube or endless scrolling on 4chan. Back when I hadn&#039;t whittled the list to just sexual gratification, I simply did these other gratifications in addition to masturbation, without decreasing the proportion or quantity of masturbation, and just had even less productive time and felt worse.<br><br>I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any way I can subscribe to keeping it a secret. You may think I&#039;m extreme, but I think there can only be true peace in a relationship when there&#039;s complete honesty--NO exceptions. White lies or putting off the truth for some relatively short amount of time for sake of better timing, conversation, etc. is okay, but in the end nothing can be held back. Despite this belief, I was a hypocrite in exactly this area: I held back on telling my girlfriend what my fetish was (she did know I struggled with masturbation and porn in some capacity) for 7 years, and it contributed to that relationship falling apart. It&#039;s a terrible feeling having to hide something from your partner. Don&#039;t do it.

Exactly, you don\u2019t want to get caught up in just one thing.

Start listening more to that, and be conscious about your emotions, but don\u2019t use them to evaluate whether or not you should do it. Stop thinking your feelings are a reflection of whether or not you want to. Become as interested in the harsh emotions as the pleasant ones. Be very aware of them.

You are overthinking this whole situation\u2026. It\u2019s just one woman\u2026. Let me tell you as a guy in his 30\u2019s who did a 2 year womanizing thing at 30 years old, that it\u2019s kind of funny how things work out with women\u2026. <br><br>So I decided after becoming single to womanize. But I was really bad at it\u2026 I spent months directly approaching women at bars\u2026 got some numbers but mainly rejections. And the dates went really bad. I\u2019m talking dates with like 10+ women. <br><br>Eventually all of those experiences changed me. It took awhile but you and do something over and over and over again and not experience growth. Like if you played basketball twice a week for 6 months there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t get better. <br><br>So eventually I just got better at getting women. But they weren\u2019t coming to me. I was still approaching them but being smoother about it and had better instincts in dates about what to say and how to converse and stuff. I got laid a lot for a while. <br><br>Then after like a year of that lifestyle, I woke up one day and was depressed. A hot girl had left my place after a great night and I should have been happy but I wasn\u2019t. I felt shallow. I didn\u2019t want a relationship but I didn\u2019t want to womanize anymore. so suddenly I stopped wanting to get women. <br><br>This new perspective came over me and for several weeks I just started doing my own thing. Then all of the sudden hot women started APPROACHING me. <br><br>I\u2019d be in the laundry room at my apartment.. I\u2019d be walking down the street in a college area\u2026 I\u2019d be sitting by myself at a bar just sipping a whisky minding my business\u2026. It was crazy dude\u2026 I just got flocked by women because I had become genuinely aloof. I didn\u2019t even want them anymore.<br><br>conclusion: if you want women spend time trying to get them so that you get good at it and burn out and stop wanting them. once you don\u2019t want them anymore, women will start approaching you. <br><br>This one girl is no one my man.

My sisters flat out said one of my gf is ugly and I can do so much better even though I liked the girl overall.

Especially eye witness accounts from at a distance.<br><br>If you want to understand anyone better who tends to have a reaction to something that you do not understand the reasons for ask them about the thoughts that lead them to these emotions. Be a thoughtful and attentive listener if they choose to open up about something. Not everyone is self aware of their internal machinations and it may have not occurred to them to think about why they react in the way that they do.<br><br>For example I am curious why you do not think of yourself as a misogynist when you use misogynistic terms like hysteria? Perhaps you did not know that the term is no longer used and is not considered a real medical condition in the DSM-5. Perhaps when you compare yourself to others in your life you do not seem so bad in your opinion.

If you&#039;re just smoking or snorting it, you can still OD, but it&#039;s somewhat harder. Best case scenario you get a very pleasant warm feeling for a few hours and that&#039;s about it for the time being, then you decide you like it and want to do it once a month, then you want to do it on weekends, then you decide to do it on off days where you&#039;re feeling shitty, then it&#039;s every 2 days, then you start getting sick whenever you&#039;re not doing it, then you need 50 bucks to get you where 10 bucks used to get you, then you can&#039;t stop doing it or else you get dopesick, then you don&#039;t stop doing it because you can&#039;t feel anything anymore unless you&#039;re doing heroin, and then you&#039;re a dope feen potentially for life because you can&#039;t forget what opiates feel like ever again and then you can either die of fentanyl od or become homeless and destitute and have a life built around dope, or a functional addict, or anything in between.
