Getting them to be attracted to you is by either being good looking or a chill, interesting guy to work with. So since two already asked you out just keep doing whatever you are doing and don&#039;t sweat it. If you want to ask someone out, key is to make it easy for them to decline.

She was very attractive and she knew it. So guys would constantly approach her, even if I was with her. Every guy we knew was trying to get with her. We never became exclusive, but after awhile she started talking about all these times she &quot;accidentally&quot; would sleep with guys. It was fucking weird. Got out of there real fast, too many red flags. Her friends got tired of her attitude eventually and ghosted her.

I&#039;m saying how you still see your friend as a love interest and now that she does not speak to you as much as she did before, it automatically means that your means to acquire the relationship you still desire has become forfeit. Then you try to validate this idea with your friend having starting a new relationship with someone else. <br><br>The premise of a missed chance at love because of a new relationship getting in the way is common. So I understand why you want to view it that way. But looking at what you are even jealous over, which is apparently, just her attention. It seems to lack a proper basis.<br><br>You still have autonomy to take steps talking to her as frequently as possible. Sure, it may be less than before but you should still be able to strike the ideal balance that suits both of you well enough.

No wonder there are so many incels, as MEN ARE THIS FUCKING RETARDED TO OSTRACIZE WOMEN WITH NORMAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOR NO REASON. If a woman does not get married it is normal for her to have the number of partners you said your girlfriend has had. Because women, too, get dumped. And they too, need to have sex life, preferably relationships, not to end up as social outcasts, as no one wants to be friend of a loser who has no sex life. And if you haven&#039;t got friends irl, to post pictures of on your social media page, you won&#039;t have following, and if you haven&#039;t got that, you won&#039;t be hired by anyone either. As no one follows a loser with no friends and no one hires a loser with no following. So, if a woman stays a pure virgin or has one brief relationship as a result of being dumped, before getting married in her late twenties or early thirties, SHE WILL DROP OUT OF SOCIETY AND BECOME A NEET for the rest of her life. <br><br>Whatever, rot alone, idiot.<br><br>And yeah, I&#039;m not going to check the replies as there will be a PACK OF RETARDS concluding on the basis of my post that I am some kind of a &quot;roastie&quot;.

My parents offered them food, snacks and drinks which they were thankful for except one that would mildy sperg every now them when he was offered food. I actively sought to make our year be close to each other. They even came over in the mornings before school to play at times. Its a bit sad for me to say this, once the guys got their next gen consoles (and PCs) they didnt invite me over with them. The guy that sperged out at times could not believe he got nowhere near the interest when he got his next gen console that I enjoyed. Eventually the year started to splinter year after year as they sought more &quot;exciting&quot; things (like booze) and made the groups more &quot;exclusive&quot; (each group trying to appear as more desirable than the other).

Instead, try gradually introducing the dry food over the course of a week or two. Mix a small amount of dry food in with their wet food at first, gradually increasing the amount of dry food as you go.<br><br>Make sure the food is fresh: Cats are sensitive to the smell and taste of their food, so if the dry food has been sitting around for a while, it may not be as appealing. Try using a sealable container to store the food and make sure to throw out any that has been left out for more than a few hours.<br>Offer a variety of flavors: Cats can get bored with the same food day after day, so try offering a variety of flavors and brands to keep things interesting.<br><br>Wet the food: Some cats may be more likely to eat dry food if it is moistened with a small amount of water or broth. This can also help to prevent dental problems that can be caused by dry food.<br><br>Consider adding some wet food: If your cat is still resistant to eating dry food, you may want to consider adding a small amount of wet food to their diet. This can help to entice them to eat the dry food and can also provide additional hydration.<br>It&#039;s important to remember that every cat is different and what works for one may not work for another.

I went a bunch of times this year but I only did 6 or 7 proper approaches. 3 in April on cruiseferries of which just one was in the actual club of the boat, 3 late summer of which one wasn&#039;t really a club, it was a barcade, and one was outside the club on the way to the subway. On a boat I both hang out in the club and go around the whole boat for women playing on arcade machines or slot machines etc. In clubs I have hung out on the dance floor a lot but not many girls have shown interest on the dance floor so I think it&#039;s a waste of time. I will hang out a lot in the smoking room from now on, it&#039;s the best place. Haven&#039;t approached in the bar of a club but one time a pair of girls showed interest in me when I was just standing beside the water pitchers on the bar. One approach I did in a club was on the edge of the dance floor, got rejected. I think that time I had been hesitating too much and they might have seen it. You&#039;re not supposed to wait when you see a girl or a set of girls you like, 3-second-rule. I also did some approaches that weren&#039;t proper. Tapped one girl on the dance floor on the shoulder on two separate occasions, held my beer over to one girl on the dance floor, walked up to a girl playing a slot machine and she totally ignored me. (might be counted as a proper approach) Maybe she was deaf because there were a bunch of deaf people on the boat.", "time": 1671683205, "resto": 27955148}, {"no": 27962408, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:29:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27962398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27962398</a><br>Also another not proper approach was I turned toward a girl on the dance floor.

I had a girl approach me on the dance floor by coming up and dancing in front of me and either she or I talked, don&#039;t remember. Dance floor is mostly just body language. Really the only place you can do a proper approach in a club is the smoking room, or if they have some relatively quiet section of the club, or outside the club. By proper I mean you go up to her and say something. I tried that with the 2-set on the edge of the dance floor, but they could barely hear me anyway. On the dance floor you are pretty much limited to body language only, maybe some shouting into the ear. Mystery says in The Mystery Method that the dance floor is not a good place to approach. You can hang out there part of the time and see if some girl gives clear signs of interest, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a good idea to hang out on the dance floor and &quot;approach&quot; women there.

Not sure how attractive the old woman was but I don&#039;t think she was attractive. Anyway I have a kind of fetish lately that I want to fuck a woman about 60 years old.

I could probably have fucked her if I hadn&#039;t sperged out in texting. I&#039;ve seen some hot 60 year olds. The old woman on the dance floor don&#039;t know how old she was, maybe over 60.

While your ex is grieving, trying to get back you and contacting your current girlfriend to &quot;give you back to her&quot; (in way, as I interpret it, to break up with you so she can get back with you) which would unsettle your current gf (in the least) your current gf is cruel. Your current girlfriend being cruel and trying to humiliate your ex girlfriend may indicate that she has cruel tendencies which she may treat you that way too. Already, she appears to accuse you of siding with your ex. Your current girlfriend might think that she is &quot;impressing&quot; you with trying to humiliate your ex. <br><br>If I was you, and speaking for myself now, I would refuse to marry a girl that is cruel and tries to humiliate people. If you were trying to humiliate her exes she would be like &quot;omg needy&quot; (assuming she is a millennial chick). I refused to marry a girl that had contact with her ex bf and she even raised the matter of getting married which I refused. A month after we broke up she was in an other relationship. Very sus. Glad I didnt marry her and the other guy has to worry about her being in touch with other guys.
