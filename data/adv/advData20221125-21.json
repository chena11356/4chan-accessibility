Not just for the law&#039;s sake but also cause I think that&#039;s best for a healthy development. The earlier one starts with sex it usually has a bad outcome and my priority is her not my own wishes. The purity must be safeguarded it is a sacred thing that I won&#039;t rob her off. I am not impatient and I do seriously intent to wait a few years and stay platonic. Cuddling is the furthest I&#039;ll go.

I&#039;m not even immature for my age but still find her mature in mind as she&#039;s been thru a lot a hell of a lot. <br><br>Meet her at drug rehab I first thought she was 18 that&#039;s what she first said and I genuinely believed it had no doubts. So I flirted with her. Later she confessed she was 14. When she said that I immediately said ok we can stay friends but no date and no sex. Then I was shocked at her life situation at such young age and tried to help her out but eventually I crushed on her. Which was mutual.<br><br>Now again not talking sex cause its also against my religion to have sex with someone that is still under the guardianship of her (foster) parents but these feelings are strong as I find her perfect. <br><br>What should I do?
