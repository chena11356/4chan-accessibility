I was skinny when I met him (24\u201d waist, 90 lbs) and I used to be pretty fat. I noticed that no matter if you had huge tits or a fat ass guys wouldn\u2019t give a fuck of you were fat. I was one of those fat girls with big boobs and a nice ass and guys always commented on my weight, so I lost weight and naturally my butt isn\u2019t as big and my boobs are pretty flat now.

So we met primarily through our friend group and through the gym. I go to the gym to maintain my physique and I have no intention of gaining muscle mass or bulking. When we started dating he started talking about me getting a fatter ass. He would always take me out to restaurants and say that I should order more food too. Soon he started comparing me to his extremely muscular gym friends who are girls saying that they were skinny like me but eventually gained muscle and became healthy. I was honestly pretty offended. I am healthy, and I like being skinny. My clothes fit better and I\u2019ve worked hard to have this body. <br><br>This didn\u2019t stop here though, he started saying hat since I didn\u2019t have big boobs I needed a fatter ass. Mind you I don\u2019t have a flabby ass and it isn\u2019t flat either. I have wide hips and my butt is pretty round. My bf also started accusing me of being anorexic and saying that I would starve myself before we hung out and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t gain any muscle mass. In reality I just count my calories and do a lot of cardio and Pilates. <br><br>Eventually I asked him why doesn\u2019t he just date one of those muscular girls at the gym, since he seems to not like me being skinny.

I think there was just an unfortunate convergence of three things that led to me recoiling after actually interacting with a female, and those were 1) flaring hormones which caused to me to obsess over women, 2) this obsession led to me doing the self improover which reinforced the obsession, and 3) the physiological and psychological (ie sexual) stresses that nofap and the other things created further reinforced the obsession, while also making everyday unbearable.<br>Anyhow, I asked the first out, we got lunch, I made a fool of myself because I had never interacted with a female like that before, and then I started internally self destructing after she wouldn\u2019t agree to a second \u201cdate\u201d (the first hardly counts in my mind).<br>Cont", "time": 1671196856, "resto": 27922861}, {"no": 27926304, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27926302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27926302</a><br>That\u2019s roughly the time I discovered incel stuff and it made sense.

It just changed all of a sudden. I realized that I was the issue. I came to understand why women don\u2019t find me attractive, and it\u2019s unfair for me to hate them for doing what they are naturally wired to do. I also accepted that I was choosing not to become attractive. I learned then and now know that I have to both become attractive AND go out of my way to talk to women.

A common talking point of theirs is that the sole purpose of life is procreation, starting families and that they can&#039;t do this, but this isn&#039;t true. As is commonly observed among men reaching their zeniths in their 30s and even before them, there are TONS of women available to do this: single mothers, workaholics who had a change of heart, conventionally unattractive women with losing streaks, etc. The options are there, but they refuse them because they aren&#039;t the idealized form of whatever women they have in their head. This contradicts their common argument of that procreation is the SOLE purpose of life, genetics doesn&#039;t care how many dicks have been in a woman&#039;s hole, just that she can do the work of producing a child and delivering them to term. The group isn&#039;t deprived of this, it&#039;s simply a deflection. It&#039;s also untrue that the purpose of life is procreation, life doesn&#039;t care if you do or don&#039;t, the fabric of spacetime won&#039;t fall apart if you don&#039;t get your dick wet, it&#039;ll just march on regardless of what you do. You also won&#039;t care in death either, simply because it either means an afterlife surrounded by the absolute shitload of family waiting for you on the other side or that it&#039;s a void of nothing, you won&#039;t ever know the fate of that lineage of yours, whether it continued or died out. Even if lineage did matter, the goal of a incel would then be to keep amassing wealth and influence until a woman comes along to snare her interest, life is inherently expansionist, so if producing heirs matter, so too does power and influence so that new life gets the best possible start to do it again. Of course they undermine their own argument by not doing this either. <br><br>Basically, the entire incel group are just a bunch of a overgrown children who desire perfect wives in a world that never promised them such a thing in the first place, its a death cult of ignorance to be ignored.", "filename": "1656801236664", "ext": ".gif", "w": 226, "h": 224, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1671268299407428, "time": 1671268299, "md5": "kYXgw+ArvhGiH9YPaqg+UQ==", "fsize": 186144, "resto": 27922861}, {"no": 27931952, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)04:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27931928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27931928</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the fabric of spacetime won&#039;t fall apart if you don&#039;t get your dick wet</span><br>The meaning of existence is different from the meaning of life.

In my experience, women have a &quot;greatest hits&quot; of male qualities from past lovers that they compare you to on an almost constant basis. After a certain point, you won&#039;t be the first, biggest or best anything for her which leads to less satisfaction for her in the relationship and in the bedroom. She&#039;ll be feeling like she is just settling for you and that you&#039;re not valuable/a catch which will be heartache down the road for you one way or another, even if you don&#039;t catch her cheating to scratch that particular itch that you can&#039;t scratch. It ruins the relationship outright and you will rarely make it much further than the honeymoon period. Ask any woman with a high body count how long their longest relationship was. It&#039;ll either be almost a decade (married too young and then slut phase) or if they&#039;re being honest, probably 2 years max but a lot more like 6-12 months.<br><br>Also, if you&#039;re lucky she&#039;ll tell you about all the stuff she let numerous other guys do to her.

If I want to speak with my parents prior to the breakup, I won&#039;t be able to smoothly break up with Orange until mid-January.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturday 17th Dec - Dec 21st: Going over to Orange&#039;s flat to celebrate Christmas.

The early pick up artists of the mystery era learned magic tricks for this. I find that cheesy and it never works as well as they say it does. I recommend asking to see her finger nails if they\u2019re painted. Or if you can somehow figure a way to get her to feel the cloth on your sleeve, try that. Your main goal is a light touch in an inoffensive area. You don\u2019t go directly to the leg or back. <br>To add more sexual flair, try and find a way to get her to think she offered it first. Do this by bringing up topics that can go in a sexual way, but never make them sexual yourself. A good example here is to bring up something like how you like I sleep, or what a good morning is like. If she started to add in talk of last relationships that\u2019s a cue to start responding with \u201coh I once had a girlfriend that was like that!\u201d as you get more familiar the sex part will come. But by that point you\u2019ll need to decide what kind of girl she is. There\u2019s the kind they only want experienced men and there\u2019s the kind that want modesty. No one wants a virgin.<br>Meaning, if your body count is 20, say it\u2019s only been about 5, that way you\u2019re not new but you aren\u2019t fresh.

Even 3-4 days later is usually good.

We must live with our mistakes, but you can love in spite of them and that&#039;s your choice.<br><br>Now he&#039;s at the point where he wants her to see that she has a family when she likely only had her mother&#039;s side for her whole life, he does care about this girl. It is tough for your family, and I assume he&#039;s only doing it now that there&#039;s some level of acceptance that the events have occurred. He is putting pressure on all of you, and it&#039;s because of his own infidelity, but it sounds like he&#039;s taking this risk on his life with all of you out of a desire to do right by this innocent girl, not because he&#039;s trying to normalize his wrongdoing. I&#039;m sure he is just as stressed and worried about what he&#039;s doing knowing that it&#039;s straining the family, but he feels strongly about giving this girl what he feels he owes her, and I think that at least is understandable. Ignorance is bliss, but I feel like it would be a shame to truly discard an innocent child.", "time": 1671261207, "resto": 27931460}, {"no": 27931736, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:42:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27931648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27931648</a><br>I truly don&#039;t know if the mother of the girl knew if my dad was married, i imagine she probably did but only my parents know. <br><br>I try to understand, I&#039;m a man myself and i know that sometimes lust make us do stupid things, but he was a married man c&#039;mon.

I was hired for a low wage but was told I would get a 50 cent raise at 3 months. I asked about the raise a few weeks ago and was told I would get it and to check my work account to make sure it goes through. I have yet to see it and talked to my manager today about that and other issues I was having he called the supervisor who downgraded my raise to a &quot;maybe&quot; and that he would try. I am not the first person to get this line. I also have friends who work in a different field for a lot more money but with shitty environment. the problem is that I actually love my job and coworkers while benefiting the community I grew up in. Its a miserable fucking place that is literally falling apart in every area. nursing staff don&#039;t have gloves, cups, or trashcans so they have to borrow ours, every department is understaffed resulting in neglect of patients. but I get the opportunity to bring a bit of kindness and joy to a group of people who have none and a lot of whom are unfortunate enough to be aware this is where they will die. i&#039;m ok with living on a tight budget so I can do this but I also can&#039;t allow my employer to take advantage of mine or my coworkers good nature.

Manager tries his best but has no real power and supervisor is beholden to our corporate overlords who won&#039;t give him money for anything we need let alone labor. we&#039;re being told to cut overtime or they will have to start firing people but we are already at the point where we often only have 2-4 people doing a 7 person job. how can I get what little I (and my coworkers) am owed from a place that is very obviously putting as little as possible to keep the home functioning until it gets shut down and bought by the State at the taxpayers expense?", "filename": "finnercorbs", "ext": ".png", "w": 1100, "h": 1154, "tn_w": 238, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671245599431889, "time": 1671245599, "md5": "ZHv0QzUkE+QN2ELBSux/og==", "fsize": 2182381, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-handle-shitty-work-situation", "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 27930299, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:58:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "50 cent raise is dogshit.
