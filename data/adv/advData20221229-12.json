Learn to give people a chance. Learn to allow people to grow and change, too. It doesn&#039;t matter if a girl is into cape shit if she&#039;s a good person with good character and she&#039;s capable of deeper connections. You gotta look at the bigger picture.

So what I did was the following:<br>Instead of waking her up, or sleeping somewhere else like a cuck. I decided to crash in there, and rightfully so. After all it&#039;s my bed, my bedroom. She has her own too. It&#039;s not like she sleeps on the living room or our house is too small. Anyways, after I woke up she wasn&#039;t there anymore. So I took a wild guess and figured she was uncomfortable and left. But to my surprise, after questioning her about the why of she was sleeping in my bedroom. She said that it was because of &quot;your air conditioner&quot;. And you know what that&#039;s a good excuse for that and I&#039;d probably do it if I were in her shoes. (She has a fan in her room and not an air conditioner.) But why am I posting this here? What&#039;s the point of this post? Well the thing is that, she also mentioned liking sleeping with me. And that struck me as odd. Mind you we&#039;re both young adults. She is in her 20&#039;s and I&#039;m 25. We&#039;re both living at the house our parents gave to us as a gift. We&#039;re sharing houses because it&#039;s better economically-wise. I think that socially-wise it&#039;s not the best though. And that shows.

Once inside, you&#039;re usually in a bar/club like atmosphere with naked or almost naked women with numbers attached to them dancing around for your pleasure. This one place there were two levels with a glass/plexiglass whatever floor... you could sit and drink staring at naked thai girls dancing and winking at you while also looking up at thai pussy gyrating above you. One girl on the second floor caught me staring, laughed, pointed at me, and started dropping it to the floor so I could get a good view of her pussy and asshole.

The parenting plan allowed for coordinated visits at his discretion. She calls randomly to spend time with him, and my friend doesn&#039;t see the harm in it, and lets her have him for the day. She doesn&#039;t come back to drop him off that night, and it&#039;s the following evening when she finally answers the phone. She said they&#039;re half-way to the east coast to live with her dad and that she has brain cancer, then hangs up and my friend isn&#039;t able to get ahold of her again for weeks.<br><br>During those weeks he filed for a court hearing, hired a better family practice attorney, and is able to have her served summons at her dads on the east coast, only for her to not show up at court here on the west coast. The judge gives her another chance, served again, and she phone&#039;s into the courtroom. Judge says bring the kid back , she says no, judge says she&#039;ll go to jail if she doesn&#039;t for the laundry list of crimes she&#039;s committed, Judge asks if my friend can go to the east coast to get his son and he says yes; Judge says she has 3 weeks to comply and give their son to my friend (the legal custody parent) when he goes to get him. Hearing ends.<br><br>We do due diligence, call the east coast police where she lives, and come to find out her and her bf filed a restraining order against my friend when they arrived in the east coast, which was awarded. Her police say my friend and any third party acting on his behalf are not allowed there and will be arrested if he or I go there to retrieve the kid; even with a court order from our state; the son&#039;s state of residence as described in the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act. Her sheriff says the same thing, and her state patrol says the same thing.

She&#039;s incapable of communicating with me on anything serious, she just shuts down. I thought she was breaking up with me recently because she decided to stop talking with me (we are in a shared apartment) and started sleeping in another room (on the floor! instead of with me in our bed) for a week. When I confront her about issues she refuses to look at me, usually hides under a blanket or turns her face away with a cringing expression (I confront calmly and softly, but it seems to make her physically ill). Basically, small non-issues (which of course can be simple misunderstandings...) can sometimes turn into large drawn-out issues bc she refuses to communicate and turns to the Silent Treatment. I&#039;m worried the resentment I hold over hurtful things she&#039;s said to me, ways she&#039;s treated me, and ways she&#039;s drug out issues in the past will keep weighing on me until I completely fall out of love with her (it has, partially, had that effect already).<br><br>I want to ask her to get therapy, with serious note of the communication issues not being addressed. We&#039;ve had no issues recently so if in a good mood she might not shut me out instantly.

She makes me feel she&#039;s not into the relationship by lacking interest in communicating and the reason she won&#039;t meet my mom has been stated as there&#039;s no point since we won&#039;t be together forever, although we are definitely loving to each other and it&#039;s clear that she wants to stay with me for long time. Her #1 coping mechanism is to &quot;ignore things until they go away&quot;. I&#039;m worried about confronting her out of the blue to mention that I want her to get help, because I fear that she&#039;ll give me the silent treatment again or just tell me to leave her if she&#039;s such a problem.

I have no idea wtf you&#039;re talking about. This post seems more like a homo fantasy than anything else. <br><br>I don&#039;t think I have life on easy mode, but not for any of the reasons you&#039;re fantasising about. I am by no means stupid, indeed the exact opposite and no one takes me as otherwise. <br><br>The ugly truth about women is, as much as they complain about men getting handsy with hot girls, women get far more handsy with hot guys. Strangers thinking they have a right to touch you is very demeaning and invasive. It doesn&#039;t feel good to be treated like a piece of meat, and it&#039;s seen me end up in, shall we say violating, situations when I&#039;ve let my guard down. I stopped ever letting my guard down in social situations for that reason. <br><br>Yes, I&#039;ve had a lot of empty sex (mid triple digits) but that creates insecurities for many women when you&#039;re in a relationship with them. The same feelings men complain about on here for women who&#039;ve had some sex, women complain about too. I am married, but even after all these years it sometimes makes my wife uncomfortable. <br><br>The unwanted touching has simmered a bit as I&#039;ve approached middle age, but the endless flirting has not. That too creates uncomfortable situations with my wife. She mostly understands that I&#039;m not reciprocating however one can only see their husband be flirted with so much before jealousy boils over. She sometimes jokes she&#039;s going to need to poison my food &quot;one of these days&quot;. <br><br>I have certainly had far more possessive and jealous girlfriends in my life. I&#039;ve had girlfriends and ex-girlfriends attack me with weapons. Knives seem to make up the bulk of it but sometimes blunt force objects. Some have tried to cut off my dick, some have tried to cut my face and others have tried to take my life. Sometimes while I&#039;m awake, sometimes it&#039;s what I&#039;ve woken up to.

Find someone&#039;s weak point and apply pressure. Sometimes it isn&#039;t always a conscious thing - manipulative people sometimes just instinctively know how to get people to do what they want. If she has clear abandonment issues, manipulate her into becoming attached to you and then threaten to leave her if she doesn&#039;t give what you want. If she has had an absent father then shower her with validation and reward her behavior with the kind of praise she never got from her dad. Love bombing is also fairly effective when used against women that have a pathological need for validation and love as a result of some trauma in their lives. &quot;Attractive&quot; is a relative term, anon, especially when you&#039;re talking about people whose ability to find and select romantic partners has been permanently fucked by some trauma in their lives. If you know how to push someone&#039;s subconscious psychological buttons, barring being some hideous 2/10 it isn&#039;t that difficult to coerce someone into being attracted to you for the purpose of satisfying some deep, underlying desire. People are simultaneously more complicated and simple than you think they are.

That leads me to believe you probably default to explaining how she&#039;s wrong to feel the way she feels as a way to fix it, before you have validated her feelings. Regardless of your views on gender issues I think we can all admit that women face a disproportionate amount of pressure to be beautiful and to also meet their partners needs for sexual novelty, we are trained to constantly feel in competition. Clearly she has reasons for viewing your ex as a threat that go beyond you, I know it&#039;s stressful because that insecurity is being directed at you but if you really want to stay with this girl then being the guy who sits and listens to her talk about all the challenges she&#039;s faced in trying to feel &quot;good enough&quot; for others you could help her see that the issue is bigger than your ex liking Instagram posts. Until you make her feel safe by not being afraid of her human emotions, she may not feel calm enough to have that self awareness. Right now she is in panic mode. <br><br>There are loads of articles online about validating emotions, the big thing is to give feedback that shows you understand her feelings and that they&#039;re valid and you love this part of her too. <br><br>These are skills all relationships benefit from but we aren&#039;t taught how to communicate in that way.

She literally didn\u2019t exchange words with him at all. But she would speak to me. So, she didn\u2019t think I was weird enough to interact with me.

You giving up on your desire to reproduce in a different time, as a different person than your parents, is because you are weak. You have decided, consciously or otherwise, to be a coward. To refuse to adapt. In so doing, you avoid growing as a person instead of making the painful changes necessary for making you into a man (the masculinity that provides competency (value in society) and security to women.).

Saw her getting nosebleeds because of my father and having bruises etc. That firstly led to me being overly manipulative as a way to not get beaten by my parents. I would \u201cread\u201d them to the best of my 8 year old ability and lie (the start of becoming a pathological liar). That translated to me trying to manipulate and gaslight people around me, would regularly steal things like Pok\u00e9mon cards or other objects and somehow get out of the situation because I could lie so well. I would also steal my parents bank details and buy things when I knew we didn\u2019t have enough money and never felt amount of remorse. I would be two faced and instigate drama and at the same time be the victim of the drama. While I was young I was raised to be the golden child aswell, my parents would regularly tell me that I was their last hope and wouldn\u2019t give the same attention to my siblings. They would say out loud that I was their favorite and I needed to succeed to prove them right. Led to me when I was a failure falsify my grades and even test results through the internet very early when I could. Because of all the immense pressure it made me become an even better liar and manipulator because I did not want to be seen as a disappointment. Everyone in my neighborhood now sees me as a perfect being that doesn\u2019t do bad things, this includes my classmate. He would tell me regularly that his father would compare him to me which led him to hating me because of it. When he told me the news I felt good because he indirectly confirmed the existence of being the \u201cperfect\u201d person parents would want.
