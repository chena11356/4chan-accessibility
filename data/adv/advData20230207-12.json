I was obviously more experienced than two of the three girls mentioned, and it was evidently the most important factor in making the sex good so early on. I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is: for relationships, a woman having sexual experience is not necessarily a positive (it&#039;s about neutral), because men typically (at least in my case) take the lead and carry anyway. And you get the privilege of bonding over discovering her preferences and such. For one night stands, it is clearly preferable to have a non-virgin woman, due to the blood thing and perhaps personal ethics (I don&#039;t want to take somebody&#039;s virginity if I don&#039;t care about them, as I consider it a significant moment). However, as I am not interested at all in ONS (and neither is it really the topic of this thread), then that goes out the window.

Which means it&#039;s possible that he was expressing transient narcissism, and not the full spectrum of it. The projection tactic, which he employed to shift all the blame onto you, is one of the traits that narcissists employ during the discard cycle.

If it turns out that you were in an abusive relationship, that knowledge may provide a closure to the relationship which you never would have received otherwise.<br><br>The best thing you can do now is go no contact for your sake, and stick with it.

The sister that was out of our lives for 3 years came to see my Dad, my other sister did not. At one point last year my Dad called my 3 year sister and asked her to help because both him and my mom had just gotten home from the hospital and my mom needed assistance. They never responded and I was left to do everything myself.<br><br>Now only two and a half months after Dad died my sister that started talking to mom again after she came to see Dad and her husband are trying to strong arm my mom into assisted living. She got the other sister that hasn&#039;t talked to my mom in 18 years and they are trying to cut me out.<br><br>My mom has cash saved in the house. They are trying to come take the cash to put into the bank so they can rush her into a home. But I have Power of Attorney. I told them to fuck off. My Mom told me she&#039;s not ready yet. <br><br>Any advice on how to deal with this?", "filename": "cq5dam.web.2125.1195", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2125, "h": 1195, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675757059179283, "time": 1675757059, "md5": "w3V38nCGnRoNVCAf89Klgw==", "fsize": 412343, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "legal-advice-question", "replies": 13, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 28290482, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:43:34", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28290349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28290349</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have power of attorney</span><br>Over your mother and her assets?

Posthitis is infection of the foreskin, usually caused by fungus thriving in the hot and moist conditions. Balanitis is infection of the foreskin and glans, and is usually caused by poor hygiene. Smegma encourages the growth of infection-causing germs.<br>Chronic infections \u2013 for some males, posthitis or balanitis tends to recur. A complication of chronic infections is scar tissue, which could stick the foreskin to the glans and make retraction impossible. Chronic infections of the penis and foreskin also increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Repeated kidney infections can affect kidney function.<br>Phimosis \u2013 the foreskin is abnormally tight, which prevents it from retracting. This can cause recurrent balanitis because good hygiene is difficult or impossible. An erection may cause the foreskin to split and bleed. The tight foreskin can also hinder urination \u2013 in some cases, the foreskin fills up with urine like a little balloon. Phimosis is the most common reason for circumcision after infancy.<br>Paraphimosis \u2013 permanently retracted foreskin. The foreskin gathers like a tight rubber band around the penis, causing swelling and pain. This condition is the second most common reason for adult circumcision.<br>Tumour \u2013 rarely, abnormal growths develop on the foreskin. In some cases, the tumour is cancerous. Penile cancer is extremely rare in circumcised men.<br>Zipper trauma \u2013 the foreskin (or other parts of the genitals, commonly the scrotum) gets caught in a zipper.

I know you love your wife like I love mine and that\u2019s what matters at the end of the day. So if you can just live with the guilt on your shoulders and bring it to the grave then you should be ok, at least if you\u2019re like me.

Women get aroused from rape and men they find detestable all the time, it&#039;s also mostly about physical attraction to them. You should be held to the same standard as her.<br><br>The thing is, once you got married to your woman, you&#039;ve entered a contract. You are supposed to stay monogamous and be dedicated to her, sexuality included, for life. If both of you fail, then the relationship becomes just completely worthless. You are willing to risk the life you have, kids, her trust and happiness, for a little bit of physical pleasure. It&#039;s not easy or feasible to cheat for decades, it&#039;s basically a guarantee you&#039;ll get caught sooner or later, causing her unimaginable pain and humiliation. So it&#039;s just funny to me you claim you love her, since all in all you place fucking someone else for a couple of minutes on a higher pedestal than her life.<br><br>Now, your wife is also to blame. There are ways to increase your libido, I was in similar situation to her. Before her surgery, my wife absolutely needed to have sex at least 2 times a day, and for me once is more than enough. So I tried my best to accommodate her, fuck her hard enough, finger her, etc. For women it&#039;s even easier, since it&#039;s just easier to please a guy. But still, what you&#039;ve done really doesn&#039;t compare to her lack of sex drive.

Every boss is 10 minutes of dodging insanely fast attacks and poking them with your sword when you get an opening. All bosses are hard and all bosses take several attempts to kill. It\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s just annoying and samesy. Elden Ring especially pissed me off because you had to fight the exact same bosses over and over. Crucible Knight, for instance, is a boss you fight at least 5 times through the main story alone. It\u2019s crazy and feels like such a waste of time.", "time": 1675759768, "resto": 28288842}, {"no": 28290510, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28290437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28290437</a><br>Is this you??<br>https://www.tiktok.com/@notebookpap<wbr>r/video/7053135696881601797", "time": 1675759867, "resto": 28288842}, {"no": 28290511, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28290441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28290441</a><br>Odds are she\u2019d like that a lot, yes. \u201cForeplay is better than sex\u201d is a meme for a reason.", "time": 1675759904, "resto": 28288842}, {"no": 28290513, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:52:34", "name": "Snake", "com": "<a href=\"#p28290459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28290459</a><br>Lmao dont u have jobs", "time": 1675759954, "resto": 28288842}, {"no": 28290514, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:52:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28290480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28290480</a><br>Dumb post.<br>Eating cheeseburger can be a solitary activity, while having sex necessarily requires you to have a companion.

Are you worried about rejection? Worried about getting hurt? These have different remedies. <br><br>Worrying about getting rejected is generally about low self-esteem - you have to try and find a way to feel better about yourself, and value yourself enough that it becomes believable that other people might value you too. It also helps, paradoxically, to go on some really disastrous first dates; when you&#039;ve done that, you realise that life actually goes on: you were single then; you&#039;re single now; life hasn&#039;t actually got any worse. So did the rejection matter? Not really. Once you get that, it ceases to be something to be scared of and just becomes irritating.<br><br>If you&#039;re worried about getting hurt, that&#039;s trickier, because break-ups really do hurt. What I think you need to do there is to consider the alternative: if you&#039;re never with anyone, you can&#039;t be hurt; but it&#039;s also awfully lonely, and you&#039;re denying yourself the chance of being happy.

In the real world (outside the insane alt-right echo chamber) vast numbers of men and women are purely platonic friends. <br><br>Second, if you take this attitude, you&#039;re acting like a woman doesn&#039;t have agency; as if cheating is something that just happens to her and is completely outside her conscious control.<br><br>Now, perhaps this actually is the case with you. Maybe you are so completely controlled by your testicles that if a woman is attracted to you, you are physically incapable of *not* having sex with her. If that&#039;s the case, I can see why you might imagine that women are the same way, by simple projection.<br><br>But in fact they aren&#039;t. If a woman is not attracted to a man, it doesn&#039;t matter if he&#039;s attracted to her - she&#039;s not going to fuck him.

People (normal, sane people, that if y) choose not to have sex all the time. So long as her relationship with you is actually valuable to her, so long as she loves you, she won&#039;t *want* to cheat on you. She won&#039;t want to damage what you and she have. Even in a case where there is actually some physical attraction, she still won&#039;t *want* to cheat. And so she won&#039;t.<br><br>But as soon as you start acting like a jealous, controlling asshole, at that point, her loyalty to you will evaporate. At the point, what you and she have will no longer be valuable enough to her that she won&#039;t want to risk damaging it.

Welp, if you only have a bachelor&#039;s, then you&#039;re SOL in terms of job opportunities since you&#039;ll pretty much only have the ability to get substance abuse therapy jobs with your degree (unless you&#039;re able to fanangle your way into a job and seriously salespitch your degree up like a business mogul). My recommendation is to try and get accepted into a university that has a masters-phd track where you can do either clinical or experimental psychology. If you don&#039;t have lab/research experience and/or your gpa&#039;s not the best, then you&#039;re gonna be in for a rough time (you&#039;ll need to have both to have a decent chance, so it may make sense to hit up your old professors for guidance and to gain experience). You can either go the PHD for psychology route which branches out to either clinical or experimental psychology, or you can get a masters in social work which may be more forgiving in terms of requirements.<br>If neither of those options sound good to you, then do what I&#039;m doing and go to medical school. Depending on the classes you took, you may have to go back and get a year of physics, year of chemistry and year of organic chemistry under your belt to satisfy the course pre-requisites that most medical schools have. You&#039;ll, of course, have to prepare for and take the MCAT, get shadowing hours in and volunteer to make yourself the best candidate you can. Note that this option is likely the path of most resistance as it&#039;s going to take a fair amount of time, but will it ultimately matter in the end when you become a psychiatrist and make 300-400k a year?<br>Legitimately feel for you, Psychbro, it isn&#039;t easy going for this degree since the only option is to continue education lest it rot on the side.", "time": 1675741696, "resto": 28288489}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28286172, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)15:47:16", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "porn reboot", "com": "hey everyone, quit porn at the start of the year and ive been flatlined for a while.
