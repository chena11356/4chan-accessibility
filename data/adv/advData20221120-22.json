That&#039;s your professional life checklist now. Assuming you don&#039;t currently have the qualifications, the job opening will lapse but another will come around eventually.<br><br>Example: Firefighter. Sometimes you&#039;ll need Fire 1&amp;2 certificates. Sometimes they&#039;ll pick you up off the street with a high school diploma. Sometimes you need to grab EMT certification.<br><br>Sometimes they&#039;ll pay you 50k, sometimes you&#039;ll make 100k. Another trap. That 100k is because the cost of living near these job offers tend to be shit. Keep that in mind. Not universal, but usually.<br><br>For job you like: research work hours/schedule, pay, cost-of-living in the area, property taxes in the area, what would give you purpose, benefits, pension, 401k matching, etc.<br><br>Don&#039;t get too hyped on the *idea* of a job. Think about it in a practical sense. What does a boring day look like and how do you feel about that boring day? You still have drive to do it? Every job becomes just a job over time. I knew Special Operations dudes who thought of their job as just another job.

My question now is this: If I need to pivot and start working with a SW recruiter, what in the fuck do I say to him AND my existing recruiter? My recruiter right now is a female SSgt and she&#039;s been really helpful throughout this entire process, from guiding me in getting a drug waiver (yes, I decided to be an honest boy and fess up. I got it approved though so in the end it worked out) to being patient with my housing fuckup. I definitely expect her to be annoyed and probably angry, but I given my time constraint I also need to be decisive, obviously. <br><br>The SW recruiter I would be working with is obviously near my mom&#039;s house, which is in a different state than the one I went to MEPS in and my current recruiter is in. Do you think, since I ship out so soon, he&#039;d even give me a chance to take the IFT/take over my DEP contract? If I contact him I&#039;m gonna explain my exact situation and quite frankly I&#039;m gonna sound like a clusterfuck to him. I&#039;ll do it, because it&#039;s not worth the regret of inaction, but I don&#039;t know the order to go about doing this. Should I contact this SW recruiter BEFORE I go tell my existing recruiter I want to switch?

Of course we\u2019ve had our share of arguments, and a lot of them pertaining to the same thing. I have a habit of getting overly drunk and not pacing myself and even if nobody is bothered by it (which is the case 99% of the time) she absolutely detests drunk people and because we\u2019re together she will get really rude to me and just wants me to go away. Now I know this is a lot of my fault, and it has driven a wedge between us the past few months. Another issue is that sometimes when we argue I will call her a bitch, which is a red line for her and we\u2019ve gone back and forth a few times with the \u201cif you do it again it\u2019s over\u201d.<br>Well last night we went out to see a band, I got a little more drunk than I expected to, only 3 beers and 2 shots of vodka in the space of about an hour and a half, and when we left she had to drive home. I apologized multiple times only for her to give me the cold shoulder, and I knew it was going to be an issue. Didn\u2019t speak much the drive home but as we got in the last 5 mins I started feeling like I had to throw up so when we got home the first thing I did was go throw up and brush my teeth. Then tried to go and talk to her and apologize to which she just said \u201ccool. Whatever.\u201d while not even looking at me. So I got upset, gathered my clothes and called her a fucking bitch and left to drive home. I know that a lot of this is my problem and my lack of actually changing this has put a wedge in our relationship, to the point we\u2019re now discussing either a break or a break up. I love the girl to death and she loves me, and I\u2019m very close with her whole family so we both don\u2019t want it to be a bad hateful breakup if it gets to that.

I&#039;m currently seeing a therapist myself. It&#039;s helping in some areas but it isn&#039;t in others. It would be a lie to tell you therapy will solve everything. But honestly, I rather continue therapy than go without it.<br>At least I have someone to talk to. Someone who will listen. Someone who I actually want to talk to. I don;t want to talk to my father or my sister because they have this bootstrap mentality. My father flat out told me he doesn&#039;t believe in depression. My sister expects me to be over it in two weeks. I don&#039;t want to see them or talk to them.<br>My mother is the only one who listens but she doesn&#039;t really get it either. Really, only my therapist. I just want to talk to people I click with. I want to come back home to someone who loves me. I want to come home to someone who will listen to me. I want a partner.<br>That too. I had a gf. Before her I was depressed. When I was with her, I was genuinely happy for the first time in my life. Now I&#039;m not with her and I&#039;m back to square one.<br>Ultimately, my advice still remains to see a therapist. Talking to a real person has helped me a lot. I would also tell you to find a gf but that is incredibly difficult in this day and age. I met my former ex through pure chance. Look where that got me.<br>The only time I&#039;m not depressed (not being depressed doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m happy) is at my job. I work in a low paying tech job. I work with other people and a team on the daily. Yeah I may not be eager to work but being at work keeps me sane. I hate my house.<br>TLDR; see a therapist, find a partner you love or who will love you, distract yourself with a job which actually isn&#039;t complete shit.<br><a href=\"#p27760262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27760262</a><br>Found the Australian", "filename": "1667864062067303", "ext": ".png", "w": 2048, "h": 1365, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1668982404747422, "time": 1668982404, "md5": "Fiy47HiIb5O2y5ZTChsSpg==", "fsize": 2979908, "resto": 27760230}, {"no": 27760446, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)17:38:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27760230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27760230</a><br>Take higher dose Vitamin D and C, exercise daily.
