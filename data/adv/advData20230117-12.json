Vitriol and criticisms get thrown around, but both sides ultimately want the same thing. The question is, what makes the modern dating scene so different than it was in the past? Why are the statistics changing so drastically in such a short amount of time?<br><br>&quot;Men aren&#039;t having as much sex as they used to.&quot; I would say that men feel that the majority of women aren&#039;t worth the effort.<br><br>&quot;Women are having about as much sex as they ever did, but they gravitate toward the same men.&quot; I would say that women feel that the majority of men aren&#039;t worth the effort.<br><br>Again, both sexes want the same thing and have the same issue. However, this has been the case for a long time, so why are things different today? I think something no one talks about is the fact that we are so much more aware of the dangers of the world and consequences of one&#039;s actions than previous generations. Crime rates are down as well, meaning people are choosing to live safe and easy lives in general.<br><br>My conclusion is that less sex is happening today simply because people are choosing to be more careful given their greater awareness of the way things are. Men don&#039;t want to end up giving up their money and kids in divorce, women don&#039;t want to get raped or drugged or beat up. And both sides definitely don&#039;t want to marry the wrong person and set a terrible example for their children. To avoid all this trouble, it is smarter to keep to oneself until someone truly outstanding comes around.<br><br>This observation isn&#039;t necessarily meant as advice, just a reminder that the news media paints a blurry picture. Trying to give you folks some faith here; it&#039;s not as bad as people would tell you. People are just more mindful today.

The threshold to cold approaching is high for most guys, especially these days with how women are etc. You can also try going to a bar or club, either with friends, or alone and if alone you might want to chat up some guys to have as wingmen. The wingmen can help get you over the threshold, pump you up, push you to do it. Also put on your nicest clothes. There might be girls approaching you at bars and clubs. Another thing is talk to only guys at bars and clubs for some time, then after some time you start talking to girls but you don&#039;t view them as girls, don&#039;t think of them as sexual objects, think of them as guys, talk to some girls but try to have the exact same mindset as when you talked to the guys, them just being people you want to chat to with no attachment to outcome, it might help to only talk to ugly girls at first to get that mindset. I think a big problem for a lot of guys when they approach girls at bars and clubs is that they only have sex as their goal, that makes you look needy. I see these guys the last hour at clubs, they have the wrong mindset, you have to go there and have fun and talk to all kinds of people with no outcome dependence. If you&#039;ve never done that before it might feel strange but when you talk to guys at bars/clubs for a while it can be fun.

Just the thought of it feels disturbing to say the least, it\u2019s something that could probably drive someone insane like some form of torture\u2026 and yet when you watch porn you are in fact watching someone\u2019s daughter or sister or mother, totally disconnected from the disturbing reality of what\u2019s behind the video4chan. You are mentally blocking out that fact, the same way you do when you see an actor as the character he is impersonating in a movie\u2026 but if you ignore the facade what you are doing is actually watching strangers who probably never met each other before, having sex on camera in the most humiliating ways possible, over and over, with always different people, in different scenarios, portraying different fantasies and fetishes, almost (if not) every day, non stop.<br>This kind of constant exposure inevitably trickles down into everyday life, making it miserable and perverted. A lot of people don\u2019t even develop socially and use porn as a substitute for interaction with the opposite sex. Some struggle to say \u201chi\u201d to a woman on the street, but in private have no problem watching someone\u2019s daughter getting violently gangbanged by a group of strangers on camera.<br><br>When you do stop watching porn you realise just how much it changed the way you looked at the world.

Relationships become disposable, you skip to the next partner the way you do with videos, never satisfied. Or maybe porn has damaged you so much that you can\u2019t even manage to have a relationship, and so the negative feedback loop begins where you watch more porn to cope with the solitude and further alienate yourself from interacting with the opposite sex.<br><br>It\u2019s simple to stop watching porn, it\u2019s hard to do it for a long time if you\u2019re addicted. But little by little you will recover, believe me. It took me a year of effort and relapsing to stop porn for good, but I did it and I\u2019m not special, you can do it too if you really want. There are hundreds of guides online to help you with it, you just need some willpower and determination, if you do relapse you must have the strength to stop again and not give up. Also, like most addictions, the symptoms will gradually improve as you lower you porn consumption.

One of the many reasons simply from a business standpoint a dating app makes money on regular users, so it\u2019s in their best interest to deter people who want a long lasting relationship (who would use the app only once and never again), and incentivise sex addicts that come back on the regular to find new one night stands.<br><br>What you want to do instead is to find social groups or activities that allow you to meet and interact in real life and organically with women and other people. Possibly something that you genuinely enjoy. Keep in mind that certain people gravitate towards certain activites, so the same way you don\u2019t look for a future life partner on dating apps you shouldn\u2019t expect to find one in clubs, at a random bar or in a rave party. More on that later.<br><br>Before you start looking for a partner you should know what you\u2019re looking for. If you have been a long time porn user you probably have a lot of physical requirements for your partner, because that\u2019s what you get through video, mainly physical appearance\u2026 and that\u2019s reinforced even by dating apps and social media (and western society as a whole really), where the discriminating factor to know if someone is likeable or not is physical appearance.

My advice is to first look for someone with compatible values, but keep in mind that no one will be a perfect match. Realise that people lived most of their life without you and when you first meet them inevitably there will be friction, but once a relationship matures your lives will align more and more with time so what at first doesn\u2019t seem a perfect match becomes so with time and effort.

I definitely agree that porn results in dysfunctional or lack of relationships. I would know I struggled quite a lot to get off it. For me at least, I hate how contradictory my existence was. On one hand I was quite successful in terms of my life, and someone who would preach the importance of family, and &quot;real&quot; relationships - while at the same time I would indulge in watching gang bang porn of girls only out of school, doing every matter of fucked up thing you can imagine. <br><br>Normal person by day, but shameful degenerative by night.

By instantly bowing down to gratification, I brought myself down to the level of a dog.<br><br>Naturally wanting to quit and actually wanting to quit was a different story in itself.

While it&#039;s true that happiness is sometimes closer than we think, I don&#039;t believe that a person should settle either. I hate sitting idly, it makes me depressed, I always have something I&#039;m striving for.

Market funds track the market based upon the top companies along a diversified set of industries so that you&#039;re not only investing in high-performers, but also spreading your risk out to avoid a single company or a single industry having a bad year causing you losses. It guarantees good gains, and saves you from hard losses; what it is unlikely to be is a &quot;get rich quick&quot; method, which people are addicted to nowadays, but it is safe, reliable, and keeps you from having to put a lot of strategy or thought-work into investing, you just pop your money in and let the market do the work for you.

It&#039;s a malignant melanoma growth inside my left armpit on the lymph nodes that of all places also decided to spread to my brain which had 3 spots with the biggest being pea sized that got zapped back in October, and I&#039;m getting ready for a second round of zapping because the follow up MRI found 7 spots of metastic tissue with the biggest being the size of a quarter. The immunotherapy has been worse than the actual cancer since it causes joint pain (immunotherapy is inflammatory in nature and you can&#039;t take any anti-inflammatory drugs), and my thyroid chemicals got blocked, and I had really low sodium levels back in Sept that kept me in the hospital for a few days, got down to about 119 when the normal range is somewhere around 135-140 and was close to going into a coma w/ my low level (thankfully I almost passed out at a hospital right after an MRI that found the metastic brain tissue and got rushed to the ER, could have happened while I was driving so lucky me it didn&#039;t). <br><br>tl:dr - maybe an upper stage 3 or low stage 4, not really doing that bad and hopefully things will be better after they remove the primary mass in the next few weeks.

If it is then intermittent fasting with a no refined sugar, low carb diet may provide some benefit. Thiamine supplementation, along with the other B-Complex vitamins, may help as well as these vitamins are necessary for proper adrenal health. Two teaspoons of non-fortified organic nutritional yeast mixed with almond butter may be a good habit to start your mornings as it contains most of the B vitamins your adrenals require for proper function. <br>A month of NAC supplementation, at 1200mg/day 600 2x/day, could be helpful if your body has been able to replete glutathione levels after so many years of marijuana use, especially int he lungs:<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/103<wbr>40948/<br>https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Encapsu<wbr>lations-NAC-Glycine-Powder/dp/B08WJ<wbr>DLHMJ<br><br>That handles the physiological part of it. Unfortunately the psychological part is far more complicated. And really there&#039;s not much I can recommend for the psychological part as much of it is dependent on your environment. With chronic stress being capable of inducing your symptoms on its own, even proper nutrition may be ineffective. That doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t try to get the physiological side in order. Physiological health should, at the least, help to make your stress symptoms more manageable. I think it&#039;s worth trying for at least a month.

But I too grew up in the countryside in the time before internet, back when our imagination was a treasure. It took us places, and great places at that. Things were so much slower back then. Simpler too. Everything is rushed now. Less care. Something has been lost and it&#039;s hard to put a finger on what exactly it is, but we KNOW it&#039;s missing, don&#039;t we?

I miss watching the rain and the ripples on the pond out back. I miss it all. And it&#039;s made worse by knowing that it&#039;s gone forever. :&#039;(<br><br>Sorry, tangentially inclined here.
