People end up either hurting the person they love very much, or in loveless marriages because they get this all fucked up. People with hang-ups or who aren\u2019t ready to settle down don\u2019t like it when that ineffable feeling of connection doesn\u2019t easily translate to doing the dishes without being asked, or asking for the dishes to be done without being a cunt about it. People who did have that special feeling and base their lives around it by being faithful, slaving away for the house and kids, giving up freedom and childhood dreams, etc. sometimes haven\u2019t checked in to see if that feeling is still there on either or both sides. Or if they\u2019re devoting themselves without a real reservoir of that beyond-a-decision love. Or if they are devoting themselves to someone who lost or never had that quality of love for them. <br>Love is not a decision, but people mean the commitment that is the rightful and logical conclusion/lifetime promise of that love is a decision you have to actively make. Especially when you\u2019re struggling. Especially when the anxious spark of new infatuation has long since spread to an eternal hearth fire, changed color but not dimmed \u2014but the kids\u2019 fucking socks and skateboards and his beer cans and her makeup are strewn all about distracting and desecrating. Sometimes it feels like the love you\u2019ve had and hopefully still do have for that person, and that they\u2019ve had/do have for you, is the only thing making that larger yarn ball decision of culminating decisions a decision still worth making. <br>Love is easy, building and maintaining a life and family with the person you love is harder than it should be if this were a perfect world with no lessons to learn.", "time": 1672652948, "resto": 28029063}, {"no": 28029741, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:52:02", "name": "Zach", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon has rigid honesty mixed in with a weird medieval approach to interactions with people</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon gets humiliated for being socially awkward</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon thinks the world is out to get him</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon asks people and they screw with him</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon gets his emotions boiled up when he can&#039;t go anywhere in the world to confide in.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon lashes out but this time gets treated like an animal.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anon basically gets the treatment a lion gets when it is a circus animal as in it wants to roam freely but it is caged up and taunted with simple measures for a show.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic is me when I think he just needs to chill out so that the world doesn&#039;t fester up to it, but I&#039;m unsure that he&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about.</span>", "filename": "WIN_20230102_04_56_52_Pro", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672656722451868, "time": 1672656722, "md5": "ULOwB4vw7SqQ+TzherHcYw==", "fsize": 146483, "resto": 28029063}, {"no": 28029791, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:12:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;can get girls, but they\u2019re not as attractive as I want them to be, or are black, which I\u2019m just not attracted to </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;decided to start dating men because I\u2019ve had intense crushes on other men in the past</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;absolutely love kissing other guys, how their stubble feels on my face</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but am just completely disgusted by anal sex, rimming other men, and cum, although the latter becomes something I can\u2019t get enough of when I\u2019m drunk, much to the chagrin of myself the next day </span><br>What\u2019s wrong with me like wtf I just want to be normal", "filename": "F38FB3B7-0C44-49AF-8173-1875853D1D47", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 1334, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672657963911195, "time": 1672657963, "md5": "gmHCO3mGImYIhF2dX85/eQ==", "fsize": 307267, "resto": 28029063}, {"no": 28029799, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:16:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28029741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28029741</a><br>Shave ur neckbeard!!

She had an alcoholic druggie father and a prostitute mother, so in their childhood, I was basically like a surrogate father to them. I&#039;ve noticed K has gotten increasingly nervous around me as time has gone on and we&#039;ve grown up. Always makes a point to hug me extra long and tried to hug me several times throughout whatever family event we meet up at. Has always admired me like some sort of god, which is pretty nice.

I&#039;ve known about K&#039;s crush for a long time but my ex-wife actually picked up on H&#039;s crush for me much faster than I did and she was sort of jealous of her. Since we&#039;ve started meeting together again semi-recently we&#039;ve become really close friends really quick.

First, a bit of context; Ex-gf of three years left me a guilt riddled mess after giving me the boot. Tore my head apart for weeks in self blame after she gave me the whole spiel about how great I was and how she&#039;d need months / years to get over me, that it was her fault and not mine and bla bla bla. Lo and behold, got a new guy in two weeks. Now that I&#039;m fully done with any feelings I had for the bitch, I want to make up for time lost agonizing by getting my head back in the game. As it stands I&#039;ve got two options: <br><br>#1 is a long time friend who everyone in my peer group has banged; she&#039;s extremely hot, (allegedly) great in bed and already pretty flirtsy with me. Extremely fun to be around, talkative as hell, we have a lot of shared interests, like the same music and understand eachother&#039;s terminally online dogshit humor super well. However, she&#039;s pretty much completely airheaded, incapable of taking anything seriously and has not the faintest clue about what to do with her life. Couldn&#039;t imagine her working / studying anything.<br><br>#2 is an old highschool pal (I&#039;m 22). Randomly met her on the street one day and decided we should grab a drink and catch up. Conversation went swimmingly, talked nonstop for three hours before she had to go to some family thing, but not before asking if I&#039;m free to meet again next week. Didn&#039;t act like she has a boyfriend, mentioned spending new years alone with a couple of gal pals so I assume she&#039;s free for the taking.

Did you know the MacArthur foundation study on successful ageing showed fairly authoritatively that starting exercise is better than quitting smoking? I would even argue that nicotine is better, broadly speaking, than alcohol - at least smoking only ever kills the smoker (second hand smoke really is almost totally baseless, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s research but there&#039;s literally research to confirm any bias you like). But even with alcohol it still warrants some nuance: Alcohol might be a poison (hence why it&#039;s bitter) but selective pressures relating to alcohol would&#039;ve started over 2 million years ago in our simian ancestors (fruit fermenting naturally - we would&#039;ve evolved to eat a lot of this as we transitioned to eat more plants, and the fact we relied so heavily on rotting, fermented, fruit would&#039;ve been a selective pressure towards better tolerating roots and meat). <br><br>Anyway, this is becoming needlessly baroque.

Your comment is ignorant as pig shit. <br><br>People cheat because there&#039;s fundamental problems in the relationship, but due to emotional attachment they don&#039;t want to end the relationship.

Statistically relationships that have one party cheat and that event acts as a catalyst for change in both parties, those relationships become stronger and more committed. It all depends on the specifics of what&#039;s missing in the relationship, whether it can be fixed, and whether both parties are interested in fixing it. <br><br>If you want to avoid being cheated on, it&#039;s pretty simple. Meet your partners needs, all of them and all of the needs of the relationship. That&#039;s how a healthy relationship functions, just some people need a betrayal to understand that. Others never understand it and go through life wondering why finding someone is so hard. It&#039;s not hard. Being in a relationship isn&#039;t about you, being in a relationship is about the other person.

I feel ridiculous but I get incredibly jealous of my 11 year old stepdaughter when she cuddles/hangs on my husband. Here\u2019s some context: <br><br>So I came into my stepdaughter&#039;s life when she was 7. We get along fine but I remember even at that point having an intense feeling of jealousy one day when I came in and saw her and my husband spooning on the couch, taking a nap together. It should\u2019ve been sweet and cute to me, but it made me feel awful. Most of the time they never cuddle, it\u2019s usually limited to hugs and hand holding and tickling, so when the cuddling happens it feels out of place from what I\u2019m used to seeing between them. <br><br>It gets waaay worse when we are around others, almost like they are putting on a \u201cshow\u201d of affection for the audience. Recently, my father in law stayed with us over Christmas for a few days and the ENTIRE time it\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t peel off of each other. Every time I turned around she was draped over his lap, hugging onto his arm and constantly (like every 15 minutes at times) saying \u201cDaddy? I love you.\u201d <br><br>It should be sweet, I should think it\u2019s cute and be happy they have a sweet relationship. It\u2019s just so off putting to me especially when it doesn\u2019t happen 85 percent of the time. And man, I\u2019m so jealous! I want my husband to give me some of that attention when it\u2019s happening and it legit feels like he\u2019s hugging onto another woman sometimes, despite my brain screaming at me that I\u2019m being a terrible person for feeling that way. And it makes me feel weird when I try to hold his hand or touch him in any way when he\u2019s in that mode with her because I almost feel like I\u2019m intruding on something. <br><br>What can I do to get over this? My solution when this happens is to keep it to myself and act like nothing is wrong because I would feel so awful saying a word of this to my husband.

Highly intelligent, just as capable of dominance as submission, working towards long term goals despite significant trauma, holding me to high standards, assertive about what the want once they realize they actually have some hope of attaining it. These are not worthless people who will just drag you down and let you wallow. Also, they have pretty normal lives generally, aside from maybe living with parents, and still have to deal with everyday things like jobs and school.

In an alternate reality, you might have died or something even worse happened. Find a way to forgive your parents without glossing over their obvious fuck ups.

I&#039;m absolutely 100% not alone in having grown into my looks/body/all of that, but I think I have better perspective and a better ability to articulate what I&#039;ve seen than most guys. When you&#039;re younger every interaction you have with hot girls is framed through the lens of being a hunter trying to &quot;secure&quot; something. Most young guys, even ones who think they&#039;re well intentioned/romantic, want to &quot;secure&quot; something steady so they don&#039;t have to keep hunting. Unfortunately when you&#039;re younger most of the truly attractive girls aren&#039;t as into you. Older guys will tell you to &quot;stop caring&quot;, or even just to outright be an asshole. What they really mean (and struggle to communicate I think) is that you need to stop caring about the outcome. Girls have a sixth sense for that. If they catch a whiff that you&#039;re that invested in the outcome of you guys dating it&#039;s a huge turnoff. Unfortunately it&#039;s a difficult thing to turn off, and I have found that really the only way to get over that hump is to just date/fuck a lot of girls until you get to the point where your brain accepts the idea that &quot;this isn&#039;t the last girl&quot;. I&#039;ve fucked around 25-30 girls and seriously dated maybe 8 or 9. At this point I just don&#039;t really care and I think the only real value in any of it is as a sort of trophy that you flex. Relationships are kind of pointless outside of that assuming you have game (or money in the case of this thread).

At least for me, anyway, the only future I see for myself as long as I know the ease of just paying a chick and getting right into it is impregnating an escort. It destroys the mindset you need to go out there and talk to a normal healthy regular chick. Because not only is her BRAGGING about other people to you she knows BORING in comparison to how some escort got abused or stole shit,she(and many OTHER women) are going to be stringing you along and you won&#039;t be getting the regular sex straight out of hentai that you want while still maintaining your weaboo hobbies.

It makes me feel everything way more intensely, it makes me feel smart, it makes me feel energized, and often times I do not feel happy when on weed, at least not the same kind of euphoria I feel when drunk. THC is much more of a mind altering substance than booze. I use it to think more creatively and have thoughts that I never considered before. Weed literally gives you different perspectives on things. You will think things you&#039;ve never thought sober, and these thoughts will feel so original and so profound.

It was perfectly preserved, and in it was the first book documenting the growth of seeds. It said that a seed grows \u201cwhen fully submerged in water\u201d and I saw a seed suspended in a bubble of water within some sort of plastic coating, like a fish in a bag.

Is it automatically sexual assault for a man to gently grab his wife in bed without asking? There is a LOT more grey than the stereotype of a stranger forcing himself on a woman.<br>I didn&#039;t say that a man forcing his wife to have sex was in any way alright. I said that it shouldn&#039;t be treated as rape, because that lumps together two very different contexts. This carries the risk of both lessening the severity of &quot;actual&quot; rape or massively overstating the severity of technically non-consensual sex within marriage. <br>I think we can both agree that a guy forcing himself on his wife who screams for him to stop is totally repugnant. But applying the legal definition of rape can even include a woman who simply doesn&#039;t feel like she wants to keep having sex with her husband in the middle of it, and if she only implicitly consented at the start (no verbal affirmative consent), this is still &quot;rape&quot;. To put that on exactly the same standing as forcible rape, which should properly be a capital crime, and to encourage people to report on their spouses for that, is corrosively bad. <br><br>As I said before, just because I don&#039;t think it should be treated exactly like rape doesn&#039;t mean I condone it. It should more properly be treated as a kind of spousal abuse. I should also say that if things even get to the point where a court is necessary, regardless of what the charge is called, it&#039;s already far too late. The main concern at that point is making sure victims can protect themselves. Otherwise, the priority should be minimizing the number of abusive relationships in the first place so that nobody has to resort to the legal system for help.", "time": 1672641866, "resto": 28028541}, {"no": 28028939, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:44:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28028936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028936</a><br>I don\u2019t have any because I\u2019m a man, holy fuck this nigga is dense", "time": 1672641873, "resto": 28028541}, {"no": 28028941, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:44:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28028925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028925</a><br>They don\u2019t really have a specific look but probably they don\u2019t say much and avoid talking about sex", "time": 1672641899, "resto": 28028541}, {"no": 28028942, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28028919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028919</a><br>prove your a virgin<br><a href=\"#p28028920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028920</a><br>oh so your not a survivalist too bad i thought you were a uber chad <br><a href=\"#p28028922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028922</a><br>then why dont you look good with black nails", "time": 1672641905, "resto": 28028541}, {"no": 28028946, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)01:45:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28028907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28028907</a><br>Every time I get the opportunity, i keep thinking about all the ways this could get ugly.

For one thing it criminalizes perfectly healthy sexual relations that some teen girls inevitably have with older guys, forcing them to live with unnecessary shame and guilt and making some of them think they&#039;re literally victims of rape even when they would never think that if they lived in a more sane society that tolerated teenage sexuality as something natural and healthy. I think it&#039;s a serious problem that now even attraction to younger women is slightly taboo even when the woman is over 18. That creates a lot of unnecessary resentment in both sexes. Women with their hysterical outrage over men dating hot 20 year olds and men being denied opportunities to fuck the women they actually feel attracted to or having to pretend they don&#039;t fuck them or prefer to fuck them and nod along with hysterical women and brainwashed men.

I\u2019m the dacryphiliac. So, seeing a man cry is the most fetishistic thing for me - any image of a crying man will get me going, so in that way it can be outside the context of a relationship, but I am imagining a relationship between us automatically and imagining him as a person, so that\u2019s why I say it doesn\u2019t feel totally partial. It\u2019s not the tears, it\u2019s a man crying.<br>I\u2019ve also been involved with various kink scenarios because of that. A lot of men who are interested in being comforted while they cry are also interested in being tied up, flogged, etc. so I learned how to do those things. The interest seemed genuine on their part, and I liked it well enough, but it didn\u2019t directly arouse me except for some activities around orgasm denial and giving sexual orders. I eventually realized I wanted to be on the receiving end of those things and I enjoy being flogged and belted, and also knife play. I don\u2019t think it has much to do with seeing sex as a commodity or standing out as more kinky than other people, I just like it because I can feel how much physical power is being directed towards me. It\u2019s kind of like, \u201cIf he can hit me this hard, imagine how hard he can fuck me!\u201d And it feels intimate.

It&#039;s strange how much of these things end up leading to Freud! <br>Also, I certainly can get behind the idea of your fantasy; it occasionally appears as a theme in my own. <br>I have always been the way I am, I think. I live in a place where everyone is fat, but I wasn&#039;t and still am not. All of my guardians and parents were big... I even liked being held by them then, asking only to be carried by people who had &#039; big pillows&#039;... Large breasts. Despite where I lived and who I was raised by, I wasn&#039;t ever fed a proper diet. My grandpa was fixated on my weight, since I constantly fell behind milestones, so he weighed me daily until I reached 50 pounds. He fed me pancakes and pop tarts and soda, just to get me to eat. I still ended up not gaining weight... I&#039;m still, unfortunately, quite thin. It started, very distinctly, when I watched the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film, I had to have been maybe 3 or 4. Earliest memories... The blueberry girl did it... haha. I knew to be ashamed of it, even then, and I kept it a secret. I still thought about it nonstop, though. Until I reached puberty, I was solely attracted to women. The fattest people in my life were women, and I was attracted to them. The people who I was annoyed with the most were also my parents and my fat schoolmates... I was a very mean child, so I would bully the fat children because I liked them... Especially the girls. <br>It&#039;s all about control, the lack of it, and shame...<br>I do wonder, how does it affect your life? Well, I suppose as any fetish would... Making accommodations like that is a hard bargain for a lot of people...<br>Also, if it&#039;s not too much information, what is the rhythm of your fantasy, so to speak? Like... what gets you going, what&#039;s the peak, and what&#039;s the result, if there is a result... Just wondering. A fetish for crying men sounds, genuinely, very captivating.
