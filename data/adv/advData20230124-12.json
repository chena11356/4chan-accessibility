Everyone&#039;s told me to go to LA because Australia&#039;s fucking tiny and jobs are few and far between. <br><br>I&#039;ve been in an 8 year relationship with my high school girlfriend; in the 8 years that we&#039;ve been together we&#039;ve never had any massive arguments, we&#039;ve never broken up and we&#039;ve never cheated on each other - as far as I can tell. We share the same interests, humour and friendship circle. It&#039;s cliche but, she&#039;s not only my girlfriend, but she&#039;s also my best friend. <br><br>She doesn&#039;t want to go to LA and I wouldn&#039;t want her to sacrifice her dreams in order to facilitate my pipe dream. And ultimately, that&#039;s what it is, a pipe dream. Working as a professional writer is a bullshit, silly job where there&#039;s no money (unless you &quot;make it&quot;) and no job security. I completely understand that the liklihood of me finding average writing work (which has shit pay) in LA is tiny, the liklihood of me &quot;making it&quot; is even smaller. So, I&#039;m throwing away my savings, my social support network and the person who I&#039;ve fallen in love with in order to chase a dream I&#039;m statistically unlikely to succeed in. <br><br>I know that if I don&#039;t go to LA and try to &quot;make it&quot;, I&#039;ll regret it for the rest of my life, and I&#039;ll end up as another Uni lecturer showing a shitty short film they made 40 years ago.

I had friends from school and stuff, but ended up making an entirely new secondary group of friends. I did this by going to concerts in town. <br><br>Just go to concerts. Don&#039;t have to be big concerts, just stuff at bars and smaller venues. Talk to people. Also buy cigarettes and smoke them, even if that&#039;s only when you&#039;re at a show. Smoking cigs is the absolute easiest way to meet new people. You can pretend you don&#039;t have a lighter, or some other people will ask you for a smoke and you can strike up a conversation. Obviously having some beers and drinking helps loosen things up too. <br><br>If you end up making really good friends, maybe you can travel to a concert or music festival in another city with them. Partying and taking psychedelic drugs with people over the course of a weekend is a great way to bond and establish long lasting friendships. <br><br>Personally I recommend the jam band or bluegrass scenes, but EDM is okay too I guess if you actually like that kind of music. Unfortunately most other genres will have more boring people that aren&#039;t into doing drugs or whatever and as a consequence they&#039;re often more reserved and harder to make friends with. <br><br>Ideally you&#039;ll make some friends from going to local shows, and then you&#039;ll end up going to house parties/after parties at their place.

I don&#039;t know who my father is but my mom loved me and she did her best to send me to school and tried her hardest to raise me. Then my mom married when I was about 10 to a guy who we&#039;ll call Dave. Now, Dave was rich. He had two daughters himself (who we&#039;ll call B and C. B lived with us) Now, Dave was an awful awful man. He was physically and emotionally abusive. He changed my mom into hating me. I never had nice stuff to wear but B always had the cutest outfits. It gets worse, I had to litteraly beg my mom to buy me sanitary stuff so I could keep some stocked up instead of waiting till the worst possible day it. Their reasoning was that he&#039;s already doing me a favor by letting me live in his already gigantic house.<br><br>Dave&#039;s physical abuse was the most traumatising of the things he did. He always either beat me with a stick from a lemon tree we had in the yard or berate me with all sorts of foul language when something happened at school. One occasion I remember as the worst was when I was suspended from school because I pushed a bully and she hit her head on a desk. He broke almost half a dozen of sticks over my back. I remember waking up the day after and my pajamas sticking to my bottom because of the amount of skin he broke.<br><br>The first thing I did after I graduated from HS was moving to my own place. I hated all of them except my mom.<br><br>Now, a few years later my mom calls me saying that Dave&#039;s in the hospital. She says he&#039;s not doing too well. She says that he&#039;s feeling sorry for all the things he did and he wants to apologise. I asked her why wasn&#039;t Dave the one who&#039;s calling me then.

Sex isn&#039;t an equation, every partner will respond to everything you do differently.<br><br>As a side note to this: if she isn&#039;t touching herself while you&#039;re inside her you should encourage her to when you&#039;re getting into it a bit more. <br><br>A surprising number of girls I&#039;ve been with haven&#039;t felt comfortable with this, but it&#039;s pretty unlikely that a girl will come without some kind of clitoral stimulation and a lot of the time your hands will be otherwise occupied. <br><br>Final point on communication is tell her if you&#039;re getting close to coming. It&#039;s ok to slow down/stop if you need to. You can switch t up to making out/fingering/eating pussy till you get a handle on yourself and go again.

And I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m looking for a hobby. Maybe just a big button to reset my life with a better brain. Every aspect of my life feels completely out of my control.

My therapists say I&#039;m disassociated but I don&#039;t know what to do with that. They give me drugs but it feels like it&#039;s just so I don&#039;t hurt anyone. Many people think I&#039;m smart because I&#039;m quiet and have glasses. But my truth is that my head is just empty. I don&#039;t really seem to have any idea of anything. I once did a meditation and got praised for &#039;effortlessly&#039; being able to meditate. We went as long as 8 hours. It just went in a flash. I didn&#039;t think anything of it.

I&#039;m exhausted of everything to be honest. I can barely take care of myself. I hate the endless cycle of eating and shitting. I wish I never had to do it anymore. I&#039;d give up a lot to be free from eating and shitting. I really dislike where I live. Sometimes I just start screaming because of my life. I spend most of my time day dreaming about taking the train somewhere far away and trying to start something new. Maybe if im in a new place and have zero resources it will kickstart myself. I already feel like a machine. I run on diesel and cranks. I totter around leaking oil doing nothing useful. Until I stop moving. And then a therapist runs over to crank me moving again. I feel like a fool. I have nothing to compare my life too so it just seems even more pathetic. At the end of the day I think I never outgrew my childlike desire to be a hero and go on adventures. I&#039;ve talked about this. They&#039;ve suggested I travel. But I don&#039;t have the money to do it often. And when I have been a tourist it hasn&#039;t fulfilled me at all.

I spent tens of hours in coffee shops trying to find an opportunity to approach. It&#039;s not like a crowded drunken club where you can just go up to a woman. For several tens of hours all I got to show for it was maybe 4 approaches. Maybe coffee shops in America are different. I fucking hate that so many clubs deny me entry. Don&#039;t know why, probably think I&#039;m too ugly or look too poor. I was denied this Saturday at a club at which I got a number and date from a hot girl in August though so that&#039;s weird (it was outside the club, we were both walking from there, didn&#039;t see her inside, she would probably have had the same response if I had approached her and her friend inside the club). One idea I have is to go to some dive bar early in the evening before it&#039;s too crowded, they&#039;ll normally let every freak and cripple in, you chat up some guys there who want to go together to a club, when you&#039;re a few guys it&#039;s probably less risk of being denied than when being alone. I don&#039;t feel like ever going back to a club or bar that denied me entry once though, even if it&#039;s a different doorman.", "time": 1674481710, "resto": 28183092}, {"no": 28183234, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:54:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Dress appropriately, don&#039;t be too drunk, have confident body language, these should get you in", "time": 1674482083, "resto": 28183092}, {"no": 28183242, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28183234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28183234</a><br>Nah dumbass, I had the exact same clothes as in August and October when I was let in, hadn&#039;t had anything to drink, same body language.

I didn\u2019t even know that cold approaching had a name I thought that\u2019s just how you meet chicks. Of course approaching will vary in success depending on location and experience. The real chads can cold approach anywhere like on the street and what not but like i said it\u2019s pretty much expected at bars to just walk up to a girl you think is attractive.<br>As far as hobbies I\u2019m not the one to ask as far as women involved hobbies.

I love her and it feels so good knowing that nobody else has ever even seen her body. Her tits, her pussy is just for me and nobody else. I don&#039;t mind if we don&#039;t do anything sexual for a while, in fact I&#039;m just as interested in the emotional aspects of our relationship. Looking into her eyes, smiling, having cute dinner dates, watching TV together, having deep philosophical talks, getting to know her as a person. I think this is only possible because I respect her and she respected herself enough to not give her virginity to some random Chad. She has waited for a deep emotional connection, rather than letting other men use her for pleasure.<br><br>My ex was a slut though. It was weird, I felt a lot of negativity and couldn&#039;t trust her, knowing that other men had seen her vagina etc. But something about it did turn me on, like I just wanted to fuck this bitch 3 times a day. Madonna-whore complex? Though when she started refusing sex I began to hate her. So even though I was somewhat infatuated, I was only really in it for the sex. I don&#039;t feel bad though because she viewed sex casually, and even emotionally cheated. Unhealthy in the long run. Also her pussy was an outie, my current gf is an innie - coincidence?<br><br>My advice to foids is save your virginity even well into your 20s. To fellow moids, non-virgin girls can be a fun experience, and a way to lose your own virginity because male virginity is a turnoff. But you don&#039;t owe them anything long term. Girls who keep their pussy just for you deserve the utmost respect though, going against the degenerate modern cultural norms. They can pair bond and actually love you, and you should return that love if you are lucky enough to experience it.

He just cares about maximizing his own perceived benefits--he gets to fuck around, and then gets a &quot;high value&quot; woman. <br><br>Waiting until marriage filters out both overt manwhores and hypocrites like OP, because it requires them to buy into the ideal of marriage--selfish guys aren&#039;t willing to make that sacrifice for anyone else, not even their wives.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like. In my opinion physical improvement is the number one best thing you can do if you are unhappy with your life because it lays the foundation for everything else.

I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died.

You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

My last ex had sex with me on the first date. Our second date was a trip to the pharmacy because the condom split. That was how she lost her virginity (allegedly, but I believe it). After that, she went on the pill and we had sex a lot. The fact that she always wanted sex and would always provide sex was attractive to me because she was demonstrating that I was the man and was in charge. All guys want their girl to be a lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets, a personal whore who only has sex with them. It&#039;s just the way it is. And then you know, she would always moderate her behaviour so that she was nice, demure, and eager to please. I respected her for that because these days most women are like bulls in a china shop when it comes to relationships; they tend to lack any gracefulness, or at least tact. I don&#039;t want arguments, bargaining, complaining etc. in a relationship. Either I&#039;m the man or I&#039;m not, and for me feminine behaviour is about accepting that and behaving accordingly. <br><br>Kind of ironically, I find it&#039;s usually girls with fairly high body counts who don&#039;t give it up easily, because they&#039;ve been pumped and dumped and have built up layers of defence to prevent that. It&#039;s a bit like how actual prostitutes are difficult to get into bed without paying, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not whores. Doesn&#039;t mean you should just jump into bed with any guy right away, but don&#039;t use sex as a way of manipulating someone or as a bargaining tool.

The problem is in your mind, not in your body. Let&#039;s assume you go through surgery to mutilate your labia. Let&#039;s assume it goes well and you have no major scars and/or loss of sensitivity. Then what? I bet you&#039;re gonna decide you don&#039;t like the way your nose looks. Then your tips. Then your bellybutton or whatever.<br>Also honestly, read this thread again. You&#039;re I&#039;m one of the most misogynistic places on earth, and even here most guys told you they&#039;d like your pussy.<br>Really, you&#039;re fucking 19.

If you&#039;re not living together, making major financial decisions together, or having sex until you&#039;re married, then the only reason a guy has to stay is how much he likes YOU. And clearly, if he decides to marry you based off of that kind of relationship, he liked you enough to want to spend the rest of his life with you. That&#039;s a very strong basis for the marriage, because you already know he likes you without sex being involved. <br>This is a big part of why people who wait, even controlling for religion, both divorce less and have happier marriages.

I just turned 28. There\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve known for 10 years now. When we first met, she really liked me and I didn\u2019t really like her much. She was rather cringe, fat, and overall just not someone I cared to be around for a long period of time. Few years passed, talk about sex, decide to be FWB. We had sex a few times but that was it. She moved away, we still are friends. Been talking to her a lot recently and she\u2019s a lot less cringe and weird than she was. She\u2019s pretty cute too. Looks like a Latina Velma with longer hair. Still chubby but not fat. There\u2019s a strong possibility she moves back to my area. I\u2019m debating on asking her if she wants to be my gf so she doesn\u2019t get taken by someone else in the meantime. I know she\u2019ll say yes if I do. Now. I have some things loosely planned in the coming months that are giving me pause. In May I\u2019m going to be meeting a group of friends from online. One of them is a girl who I\u2019ve been sexting a lot recently. We\u2019re planning on having sex when we meet. It\u2019ll be a short lived fling for the weekend and that\u2019s it. We\u2019ve already set that. Then the month after I\u2019m going to see another group of friends and another girl is wanting to have sex with me. This girl in particular is super hot. Like out of my league hot. But she\u2019s very isolated and doesn\u2019t have a lot of options. She just needs dick and I\u2019m the one she chose. So, how do I play this?

And don&#039;t expect HR or anyone else to come to your rescue; that&#039;s not how it works. Even when managers are in the wrong HR will protect them right up until the bitter end.

I don&#039;t think the corporate environment attracts leaders all that much really, it&#039;s not the place for them. Of course the image of the corporate board room is that of real serious, well-dressed businessmen who evoke the idea of leadership. But that&#039;s about where the leadership begins and ends.

But don&#039;t just understand the varying personalities but also the systems, the tools, the workflows, the approval funnels and things of that nature. Take some time to observe people, how they interact with each other or how they don&#039;t. With a lay of the land you can better determine where the weaknesses are and where the landmines are that you need to avoid. A lay of the land will also allow you to make your own role for yourself as you can provide solutions to help fix weak areas.
