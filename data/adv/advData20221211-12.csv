If you&#039;re an American like me you have to study for your Part 107 FAA Airman&#039;s certification, study sectional charts, weather, aviation principles, and then pass the test with an FAA certified proctor, then you have to buy a drone (you&#039;re spending minimum $1,500 for a professional-quality machine), get it insured, and register the thing with the FAA. Then you have to really know what airspaces are legal to practice and work in, and how to get the proper clearances to do so. Say you have a client who needs you to take pictures of their house. But they live near a Class B airport? Gotta fill out an LAANC request for that shoot. <br><br>Honestly thoguh it was tons of fun just progressing throguh all that stuff and by the end of it you can make $200/hr doing real estate phototherapy, plus you can charge for your time editing photos and videos, and their are other lucrative subfields to explore like GIS mapping, building inspections, agricultural applications, movie production, etc. Fuck I know guys who rake in $10k/Day sitting on a movie set on standby just in case the director wants to get an aerial shot. If you go in the direction of film production you can also join IATSE Local 600 since it&#039;s considered a camera platform and it&#039;s one of the best locals to be a part of.

About halfway through our relationship she told me that while she worked in China as a teacher she stayed with a British couple that housed her for free. Apparently she started having one on one class with the super young son who was like 6. While she was there she ended up semi dating the dad as he was single and they had an emotional and physical relationship. They were about 17 years apart I think. Ever since I learned about it slowly over time it’s been eating me away that the woman I love was fucking this much older guy, currently we are 25 and 23 respectively, so what should I do?

I mean it&#039;s ok. My friend is built like a tank, she is tall, taller than a 5&#039;5 manlet like me and she goes to the gym every day and drinks protein supplements like running water. Plus most of our group of friends are fatso&#039;s and s*yboys so it&#039;s not like she is in much disvantage. <br><br>Well, today i tackled her to the ground, and she started giggling, so naturally i found it funny and got on top of her and started tickling her under her armpits. Just silly things that friends do to each other. <br><br>When i tackle my male friends sometimes i also tickle them for the lulz. We are all in our late 20&#039;s.

Part of learning to get along with people and have fun with them is to simply recognize that you aren’t interested in what they’re currently talking about, but that you can still listen to them so that they feel appreciated and cared about. Then they will probably do the same thing for you whenever you talk about what they aren’t interested in. Once you build that trust, you can explore things you both like and more easily have a pleasant/fun relaxed time together. You don’t even need to have ANY similar interests, honestly.
