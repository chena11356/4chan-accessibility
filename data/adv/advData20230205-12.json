Maybe you can try to be more outgoing and show a real interest in other people even if they don&#039;t always reciprocate back the way you&#039;d want right away.", "time": 1675577723, "resto": 28270175}, {"no": 28274437, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)01:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28274072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28274072</a><br>It doesn&#039;t feel like it.", "time": 1675578000, "resto": 28270175}, {"no": 28274446, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)01:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28274412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28274412</a><br>Woman response", "time": 1675578116, "resto": 28270175}, {"no": 28274447, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)01:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28274392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28274392</a><br>i myself had an ex-girlfriend who would often throw tantrums because she was upset about something and have me practically begging her to tell me what&#039;s wrong only for her to get more mad and just leave rather than accomplish anything constructive. i&#039;ve known guys who have gone into the military and overseas only for their girlfriends and wives to get bored and cheat on them and then try to blame it on them for not being around. it becomes a little ridiculous. i&#039;m not saying guys aren&#039;t capable of terrible things, it just seems that when women commit terrible deeds, we as a society tend to overlook them because we want to go easier on women. you just need to look at divorce courts taking men for what they&#039;re worth and giving half of what he owns to a woman who cheated on him or a woman who got drunk, had sex with a dude, regretted it the next day and cried rape (true story, that bitch was crazy). it seems like when a man does anything wrong it&#039;s magnified 50 times what the initial offense was and he&#039;s the biggest piece of shit in the world, but usually when a woman does something she gets a light slap on the wrist and goes on her merry way. you get the occasional amber heard but they&#039;re few and far in between. in summation, i think men feeling like women feel entitled comes from seeing the raw deal they get in society, coupled with poor treatment they receive from certain women they meet in their lives and the ridicule and admonishment they receive from venting their frustrations about it openly. it&#039;s a game impossible for them to win.

Part of the reason my sleep schedule keeps getting screwed up is because every weekend, like clockwork, my buddy who lives in Florida and I will hop on a Discord call with a mutual friend from Nebraska, who\u2019s two hours behind us, and we end up staying up really late watching tokusatsu and playing video games. Which is fine for Nebraska guy, since it\u2019s only like 1am by the time he hops off, but for us on the eastern side of the country, it\u2019s 3 in the morning. Florida dude has class during the week, so having that set schedule keeps his sleep regular, but I\u2019m hardcore NEETmaxxing at my dad\u2019s house right now, so the ONLY thing I have to wake up for is church, and I\u2019m the only one in my house who goes, so nobody else is even available to help me wake up for it, which is whatever since it isn\u2019t their job anyway, but like I said I\u2019m just rambling. I stay up too late on the weekends to hang out with Nebraska guy and since I have nowhere to be during the week I oversleep the next day and just keep that semi-inverted sleep schedule through the week, and I can only fix it by pulling an all-nighter and hitting the rack at a normal time.

Technically I approached her outside the club, we were both walking from there after they closed, she was with a friend, but I don&#039;t think that matters, I didn&#039;t see her and her friend inside, if I had approached them inside rather than outside their response would probably have been the same.<br><br>Also nightgame is clearly way more effective than daygame. I only did maybe 7 approaches on decent girls at clubs in recent time, meaning the last few years, but I did about 300 daygame approaches, of those I fucked only 4 girls and none of them was as hot as the girl I got a date with from nightgame, I did get a few instant dates with girls hotter than her from daygame though but didn&#039;t fuck them, also got one next-day date with a girl who was about the same hotness as the nightgame girl, might have been able to fuck her but I ruined it by being too sensitive to her behavior, she wasn&#039;t in the location at the time we had decided so I ghosted, but then she went there when I texted her and waited for me for an hour texting and calling, I didn&#039;t reply but I should have, I also should have confirmed the time a few hours before the date.", "time": 1675523939, "resto": 28267758}, {"no": 28269642, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)10:28:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28269446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28269446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the other one claimed to be a virgin but it might be a lie</span><br>Did you sleep with her?", "time": 1675524537, "resto": 28267758}, {"no": 28269652, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)10:31:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28269446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28269446</a><br>Oh so you rawdogged the virgin, how did you find a virgin these days?", "time": 1675524701, "resto": 28267758}, {"no": 28269661, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)10:32:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "only ever saw a cute girl this year in the bus<br>what do you even do <br>how do i even meet girls in general bro<br><br>like &quot;work on yourself develop x skills&quot; doesnt really do shit if i got no women to practice these skills on bro", "filename": "sorry for what", "ext": ".png", "w": 271, "h": 306, "tn_w": 110, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675524760643806, "time": 1675524760, "md5": "K7gvDmzSzfHtLO/PHRRIGg==", "fsize": 108828, "resto": 28267758}, {"no": 28269782, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)10:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How different is dating gonna be once I hit my mid 20s?<br>I&#039;m in my early 20s right now and theoretically it&#039;s pretty easy<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t need to have money</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;always meeting new people through school and social events</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no pressure to marry/buy property together/start a family etc</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As long as you&#039;re not totally uggo and are socially calibrated/nice enough you&#039;ll probably find someone right for you eventually just by existing in social environments regularly</span><br>The catch is that I was too mentally fucked up to take advantage of this so I&#039;m gonna be going into my mid 20s (gonna take 1-2 years to sort my shit out) with no experience... and I&#039;m scared.

Grainy, not flattering angles, bad grooming, generic mirror selfies, etc. I know I am more attractive than my profiles have made me appear in the past. <br><br>Problem is I just don&#039;t have very many good photos of myself. I have a lot from when I was younger but I look more boyish and it doesn&#039;t reflect what I look like now. I have one set of professionally taken photos that look pretty good, but I don&#039;t want to just use those. It would be better to have some more variety. One option is I could pay to get more professional photos taken. Would it look unusual if I have only professional photos and no more natural looking photos of me doing things or being with friends? I guess the optimal profile would be a mix of both.<br><br>That brings me to the other problem. I don&#039;t really have any friends to take pictures of me. That would make things quite easy if I did. Perhaps this is symptomatic of a larger problem I need to solve before dating. It has just been difficult because I moved to a new city and I work from home. I try going to meetups and things sometimes but I&#039;m bad at talking to people in situations where there&#039;s more than two or three new people I don&#039;t know. I think I&#039;m getting better at it gradually, but still no friendships as of yet. This is part of why I still want to use the apps. Because for someone in my situation, it&#039;s like, where the fuck am I supposed to meet women? It helps that on an app you know there is at least some mutual interest if the other person matched with you.<br><br>Or maybe I need to abandon the apps and go full on into trying to get girls from social circle and go to even more events and things to make myself get better at socializing so I can do that.

They&#039;re not going to settle for anything less than they feel they deserve. Women have a biological imperative to choose the best physical specimen for their future offspring, even if they don&#039;t actively want children, it&#039;s hardwired into them. Similarly, they will also seek a man who can provide them with comfort and security. Pretty much every relationship can be boiled down to this. Sure, personality and compatibility are factors but all relationships start with a hook. My best friend is 6&#039;6 and has chiseled features. He&#039;s never single for long. My other friend is short, chubby and has cerebral palsy BUT he has a well-paid job and shitton of savings. He finally found a girl to date him.

I think any part of the body(or any material or subject/object) can be represented in these ways. Instead of getting rid of your foot fetish, I would recommend expanding your appreciation toward other things too.<br>For me, it&#039;s the skin and varying structure of the foot itself. You have sharp and subtle creases, ridges, valleys, planes created by the joints, bones, and (soft)wrinkles. A lot of them softened by the subcutaneous fat. Then you have the smooth diffusion of the red, softly contrasting/blending with the color of the surface. Fingers are these round little tender poke-able things that you can use to make expressions along with the arch, although not as much as hands. The softer calf muscles pressing against the curvy but hard tibia, creating a solid contrasting impression. A lot of this could be explained as fertility indicators or some other factors -- not sure. Obviously there are traditionally &quot;bad&quot; looking feet too, just like everything else. Good feet(or any other subject/object) are good regardless, which is also influenced by your own personal tastes.<br>Thanks for the pic.", "time": 1675582083, "resto": 28273458}, {"no": 28275444, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)05:57:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28273458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28273458</a><br>pretty face but i dont understand why you like feet.", "time": 1675594646, "resto": 28273458}, {"no": 28275704, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)07:16:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28275444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28275444</a><br>Some people are into degradation", "time": 1675599404, "resto": 28273458}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28274691, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)02:18:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "tax questions", "com": "So I switched jobs in 2022 and worked for $37,918.71 from the first job, and made $17,108.08 from the second. <br><br>I&#039;m using turbo tax, and after putting in my first job, I was at a $10,000 refund.

But it&#039;s going to be more than enough to send your house of cards crumbling into the ground, and your entire life will be turned upside down because of this. I was just like you. I grew up a rather lonely childhood, no parents and bullied by my peers. Unlike you though, there was a kind girl out there who gave me a chance and we became friends, then some other guys slowly became friends in those childhood years, and I practically had nothing to do for myself. I never had the courage to step outside my comfort zone (socially at least) and I coped by drowning myself in vydia vydia and more vydia. unlike you, I was obsessed with success at an early age, and even when I was able to enter college early and start my career, I knew this was nothing but cope for having lived a coward and never standing up for myself, letting others take over my decision making. Whenever I wanted to talk to someone, I was invaded by a sense of dread comparable to seeing gangbangers approaching you on the streets, at 2am. The only thing that made me &quot;collapse&quot; was when I looked up that girl during a very low point in my life, and found out she got recently engaged and had moved on, while I was still stuck in a loop of maladaptive daydreaming, where I only imagined the perfect fantasy of us two together, like in a Disney movie. After that, I started changing as a person and putting more effort into taking chances; not wasting opportunities. This is just a warning, continue being a slave to your imagination and you will eventually fall and crash down into the reality you&#039;ve neglected all this years.

A little backstory, in my freshman year I lived with my sister off campus and commuted. When I would masturbate I would search by the university location on instagram and do it to a few random girls that go here, sorority girls or whatever. I found one girl here (that is my age) who I thought was so beautiful that I didn&#039;t even masturbate to her after awhile. I just looked at her profile from time to time and dreamed, knowing I&#039;d never find her in a city of 80,000 people with a university of 30,000. I expected the feeling to die off like any other girl I have lusted after, but it ended up never going away. After a while I followed her and she didn&#039;t follow me back, I sent her a message just saying hello but no response. This was to be expected as she was a sorority girl at the time and I was a bit of a loner who had just broken up with my high school girlfriend. So as I tried to be normal about this, I unfollowed her and didn&#039;t say anything to her for 3 years after that, but occasionally when I would lay in bed before I go to sleep/masturbate I would be on instagram and I would look her profile up and just admire her. This happened a few times a month for the last 3 years. I know this sounds extremely unhealthy but I did the best I could to not turn into an obsessive freak.

She is just beautiful, I can&#039;t help it.<br><br>Fast forward to two days ago. I moved from my old apartment to get away from my old friend/roommate who was turning into a bum. I moved to my new apartment two days ago which is right next to campus and I promptly started moving my things from my truck inside. This went on for about an hour as I would stop for a few minutes each trip and organize/set things up. When I was walking to my truck on my fourth trip or whatever, I noticed another truck parked a couple spaces away from me and 1 guy and 4 girls walking my direction all talking and laughing. <br><br>I looked at them as I approached them and IT WAS HER. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Same hair, same frame, same everything. It was getting dark outside but I knew it was her, she was walking in front of her friends leading the group. I couldn&#039;t help but stare for a second and she stared back at me as we walked past each other, and she was probably wondering what I was staring for. After they passed me and and were 50 yards away or so I leaned against the bed of my truck and pulled up her instagram again. Sure enough it was her. The guy driving the truck is the boyfriend of who I presume is her best friend, and those two live together a few apartments down from me. The other two girls were just her friends and they were all tagging along.", "time": 1675563664, "resto": 28273161}, {"no": 28273172, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:22:05", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28273164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28273164</a><br>Continued<br><br>As I realized it really was her my heart started beating like crazy and my thoughts raced in my head. This is a town of 80,000 people with 30,000 in the university. What are the odds that her friend lives in the same building as me, they started walking to the bf/gf&#039;s apartment AT THE SAME EXACT MOMENT I WAS WALKING TO GET MY THINGS. I think this must have been an act of God. I am at a loss and after two days I still have not been able to fully process it. I haven&#039;t seen her since as I assume she left a little bit after hanging out that night. I just feel like god/the creator set this situation up to happen.

I haven&#039;t done anything about this and I probably won&#039;t unless I get another act of god-level happening where I bump into her walking near my apartment and the conditions are favorable to start talking to her. That was obviously not possible the other night as I was alone, she was with a few friends, it was night, I had nothing to say, etc. <br><br>I mean if this was an act of god, what the heck did he mean by this?

Had blood work done to rule possible causes out. Testosterone was normal, 735ng/dl. Hormones also came back normal. Figure it&#039;s related to depression/anhedonia but don&#039;t know where to go from there. Remember my sex drive kicking in like normal at the start of puberty when I was 11/12. My emotions slowly started shutting down from age 10 onwards though. That&#039;s when I stopped going to public school because my parents had the intention of homeschooling me. Depression from social isolation, no more academic progress, no exercise probably played a role. Also with no supervision child me was just consuming entertainment, playing games, watching youtube, watching porn 16 hours a day which very quickly made me overstimulated and unable to enjoy shit because I was in a constant state of being burnt out which added to the numbing of emotions. Point being my libido started shutting down along with my emotions and I stopped really feeling &quot;horny&quot; the way you&#039;re supposed to at some point when I was 16 and it never really came back - or my emotions fully for that matter. I&#039;m 24 now. I no longer live that way and have a job and work out and such so I&#039;m not constantly consuming porn or anything like that anymore but it hasn&#039;t worked to actually reset my brain. I never really feel aroused like that anymore when I look at someone. And it&#039;s ruining my ability to form relationships with people that are interested in me these days.

You kids need to actually understand the system if you&#039;re going to use it. If you don&#039;t want to understand it, just use vague words like &quot;very&quot; so we know it&#039;s your subjective opinion and not an actual measurement. Subjective attraction is relative, it changes by individual based on all kinds of factors. <br><br>Leagues are based on symmetry, gender/racial based features and proportions. They aren&#039;t a measure of subjective attraction, but objective genetic superiority. Maybe you might call it &quot;classical beauty&quot; but it&#039;s really about the wholeness of their genome. <br><br>It&#039;s standardised measure. The kind of thing you can run through software to get an answer and indeed such software exists in abundance. You don&#039;t need software to figure it out, but it exists these days because why not, retards like you might need it. <br><br>You are born into a league and you stay there your entire life.

The OP girl is a 4-5/10, we could run her through software to be definitive on whether she&#039;s a 4/10 or a 5/10 but calling her in that general range is good enough. <br><br>A league tells you where you rank compared to others and whether you&#039;re even in the running to be a potential mate for them.

I feel like dating makes me focus so hard because its not natural to me that I end up using all this mental fortitude and can&#039;t maintain any of it.

You need to realize that meeting, dating, and loving women is not a game about being perfect and getting everything right. People are attracted to other people&#039;s imperfections because it means they can also be vulnerable in a safe manner.

This is just an example but lets say someone breaks into my house at night. If I were naked, I would feel far less ready to investigate what the fuck is going on(with firearm in hand). When clothed, I feel like if I ever had to do something abruptly, I could. This of course is could probably construed as some weird schizo urge but I don&#039;t think I am paranoid or anything. I just like being clothed. I feel too much discomfort being naked. It sucks because I have heard people make remarks like &quot;People who don&#039;t sleep in the nude are obviously fucking crazy!&quot; or &quot;When I get home from work, my pants come off immediately!&quot; Shit like that. I just feel very comfortable with clothes on. Particularly a nice pair of reinforced jeans. Maybe I am crazy. Don&#039;t know. <br><br>As far as texting women goes, I think my other issue is that I can&#039;t set up dates fast enough because I just have no idea what to do for dates. I also am very restrictive with my schedule. I basically don&#039;t ever do anything after work besides go to the gym or go home because I feel like its bad luck. Like if I were to go out for dinner after work instead of go home or to the gym, I&#039;d feel like fate would somehow try to fuck me over. Sounds absolutely insane I know but that is how I feel unfortunately. Its a weird line of thinking that I trap myself. Another thing is if I tell myself I will do something like &quot;I am going to go to the store today.&quot; and I don&#039;t do it, then I feel like bad luck will fuck with me. OR more accurately, I go to the same store every sunday and I buy the same kind of eggs and milk for example. If I don&#039;t go to that store on sunday at around the same time, I would like bad luck is going to fuck with me somehow.
