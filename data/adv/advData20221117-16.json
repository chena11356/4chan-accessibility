I wasn&#039;t studying something &#039;real&#039; or academically rigorous in their eyes, and business was problematic because capitalism, exploitation, etc. College student shit I guess. Overall, it was like the boarding school I went to had people who were more mature at a young age, while these college people were still mentally high schoolers.<br>And then covid-19 hit second semester. Friend groups fell apart, online classes and isolation began. I had a roommate at least so I had a reason not to just pig out.<br>For the last two years I have lived alone. I have a car now so I don&#039;t even have to walk to do groceries, so I&#039;m sedentary. I can buy as much pop and junk food and fast food as I want and nobody can see me for me to feel shame. I become aware of how terribly I live when I feel aches and pain in my body, but it&#039;s not a constant enough state of mind to override my cravings when they get strong. When I think about finding food, it&#039;s like other things don&#039;t matter.

The prototypical Chad and &quot;Chadlite&quot;, a man with genetic advantages, i.e. height, bone structure (broad shoulders, strong jawline), race, low hairline, etc. If a man possesses these physical characteristics, he can afford to be scrawny (although ottermode is preferred) or even out of shape (&quot;dad bod&quot;). He can also get away with being a little shy and socially awkward. A woman will make these allowances because he&#039;s hawt and good breeding material.<br>#2. A dangerous and roguish persona aka &quot;the badboy&quot;. Their profile is marked by impulsiveness, high-extraversion, low-agreeableness, low-empathy and hypermasculinity. They are not necessarily goodlooking, although at times they can be unconventionally attractive. They are possessed of superficial charm and excel at manipulating female emotions. Woman from all walks of life are suckers for badboys. They often ignore the red flags and make a calculated risk to date men like this, despite the risk of abusiveness. Of course, women will deny this but what women say they want is at odds with what they truly desire.<br>#3. Betabux. A normie with a good job and stable income. Women settle for these guys, particularly later in life when they&#039;ve been pumped and dumped too many times by #1 &amp; #2. Badboys typically don&#039;t make for the best providers, after all. The majority of relationships will fall into this category.<br>A combination of the above would be ideal. That&#039;s a woman&#039;s ultimate fantasy (e.g. Fifty Shades of Grey) but it&#039;s not realistic. For that reason, a woman&#039;s tastes will fall into one of the above, depending on her priorities and present situation. If you do not fall into at least one of these categories, you will struggle to ever have a girlfriend. There will be some nuance, but it&#039;s a pretty solid rule of thumb.", "filename": "unnamed", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668686714270515, "time": 1668686714, "md5": "KnGO1B39hgsV2mUUkAtiuQ==", "fsize": 124195, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-women-want", "replies": 26, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 21, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 27739150, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:42:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27738696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27738696</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STEM</span><br>a girl that requires STEM is a red flag.
