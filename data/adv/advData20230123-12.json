You have to be psychologically unwell in order to thrive in such an environment.<br>And there are really only two types of people who thrive in it: tyrants and bitches. If you don&#039;t at least partially fall into one of these categories then you&#039;re going to get chewed up. This is especially true when you&#039;re good at what you do because when you&#039;re good at what you do you become a threat to those above you. Most managers do 1/4 of the work of the floor staff yet they make at least double their salary. Don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to let you encroach upon their position without a fight.<br><br>Of course you can try to stand your ground but it will almost assuredly get worse if you do. Usually by way of the &quot;it&#039;s all your fault&quot; game: regardless of the extent of their role in the problem, they will somehow find a way to turn it all around on you so it&#039;s your fault and not theirs. And don&#039;t expect HR or anyone else to come to your rescue; that&#039;s not how it works. Even when managers are in the wrong HR will protect them right up until the bitter end. Now if you were a bitch you would be able to take this all quietly but for people like you you&#039;re going to eventually reach a breaking point where you either snap and tell these fuckers what&#039;s what or you&#039;re going to go home during your lunch break and blow your fucking brains out.<br><br>If you want to play the corporate game then keep moving jobs every two years, even if that means you have to relocate.

I love her and it feels so good knowing that nobody else has ever even seen her body. Her tits, her pussy is just for me and nobody else. I don&#039;t mind if we don&#039;t do anything sexual for a while, in fact I&#039;m just as interested in the emotional aspects of our relationship. Looking into her eyes, smiling, having cute dinner dates, watching TV together, having deep philosophical talks, getting to know her as a person. I think this is only possible because I respect her and she respected herself enough to not give her virginity to some random Chad. She has waited for a deep emotional connection, rather than letting other men use her for pleasure.<br><br>My ex was a slut though. It was weird, I felt a lot of negativity and couldn&#039;t trust her, knowing that other men had seen her vagina etc. But something about it did turn me on, like I just wanted to fuck this bitch 3 times a day. Madonna-whore complex? Though when she started refusing sex I began to hate her. So even though I was somewhat infatuated, I was only really in it for the sex. I don&#039;t feel bad though because she viewed sex casually, and even emotionally cheated. Unhealthy in the long run. Also her pussy was an outie, my current gf is an innie - coincidence?<br><br>My advice to foids is save your virginity even well into your 20s. To fellow moids, non-virgin girls can be a fun experience, and a way to lose your own virginity because male virginity is a turnoff. But you don&#039;t owe them anything long term. Girls who keep their pussy just for you deserve the utmost respect though, going against the degenerate modern cultural norms. They can pair bond and actually love you, and you should return that love if you are lucky enough to experience it.

Because men swipe right alot more than women do. But in reality it&#039;s not that hard. These men whining on not getting matches do not realise their profiles look like shit. Seriously if you&#039;ve ever swiped on a womans tinder, you&#039;d see how many bland and weird profiles men have. Not gonna lie, looks matter, but more importantly, you have to look interesting. Most women are not dating chads. They want someone that makes them feel special, and a guy posing with the fish he caught does not exactly portray that. All you have to do is stand out in the bland pool of tinder men. If i&#039;d have to give some tips on how to improve your profile i&#039;d say: <br>\u2022 include some analog pics, the cameras are cheap and you could ask some friends/family to take them. Girls love these cause they make you look mysterious/intriguing whatever, generally they add a feeling of nostalgia and they just look a lot nicer than some shitty smartphone cam<br>\u2022include a picture with your friends, preferably having fun, don&#039;t have any friends? Dogs/cats or family members also work, you want to give them the feeling that you&#039;re social/family material and not some untrustworthy loner.<br>\u2022if you&#039;ve got any hobbies, show them. They are great conversation starters and that way you will attract women that have the same interests, which is the best way of getting likes, people look for similar friends/partners to themselves.<br>\u2022at least have one picture where you laugh naturally, girls love a good smile, and it also makes you look more approachable. Only having serious mirror pics makes you look like a serial killer.<br>\u2022don&#039;t do bio&#039;s, if you do keep em short and simple, include interests and hobbies, but don&#039;t try one of those &#039;quirky&#039; oneliners, cause your not the only guy that uses them and it gets boring quickly.<br>\u2022if you have spotify, connect it to your profile, music is a great matchmaker, and having an interesting music taste is attractive, you can also select which ones spotify will show.", "time": 1674391263, "resto": 28174311}, {"no": 28176333, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)11:51:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28174966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28174966</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most women are not dating chads.</span><br>No, they&#039;re just fucking them casually and not dating at all", "time": 1674406305, "resto": 28174311}, {"no": 28176353, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)11:55:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28176333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28176333</a><br>Dating just means hooking up.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like.

My specific situation will not really relate to you.<br><br>The TL;DR is that I am an /out/ist through and through and nothing is going to change that.<br><br>I was in the army before college. Biology degree. Wildly depressed, and medicated for it. In college I did an internship with a conservation agency and it was fun, but I did the &quot;right thing&quot; and after school I just kept pursuing my &quot;career path.&quot; Nothing glamorous or financially enticing, mind you. At 27 I had a paradigm shift, some major life changes (sister offed herself and ended a toxic 6 year relationship) and I took some seasonal /out/ work in Alaska to try and clear my heart and my head. Quit taking Zoloft during this time.<br><br>Following this, I left and did a &quot;normal&quot; job for about 1.25 years before I again felt the urge to get the fuck back outside. I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died. I&#039;ve since worked for a few different agencies/places for the feds doing /out/ things. I do not make much money. My job security is tenuous. But I feel at peace and wouldn&#039;t change it.<br><br>The point of my story is simply that if you recognize something you are truly passionate about, you should just stick with it, because trying to convince yourself you are happier in some other capacity just results in you being miserable. I wouldn&#039;t do something just to feel like you&#039;re moving forward, if that makes sense. I wouldn&#039;t do something you aren&#039;t &quot;super passionate&quot; about.

Is going back to community college and transferring the best choice? Is there a way I could just apply and get into a bachelors program immediately? Getting some kind of certifications beforehand? I&#039;ve been looking but there really isn&#039;t any resources on what to do for people who have spent years doing nothing.

It has been 8 months. Short term (ignoring hair) side effects were increased libido, increased penis sensitivity, increased ejaculation volume, but decreased thickness, slight ball ache. More medium term I started noticing less enjoyment of alcohol, less desire to get drunk, reduced libido, decreased tolerance to stress, increased anxiety, some muscle aches and fatigue. Now 8 months in I&#039;d say overall the decreased desire and enjoyment of alcohol, the decreased libido, the reduced stress tolerance, muscle aches and fatigue seems here to stay. I am tolerating the side effects because they are tolerable, but I am not ignorant of them. My major concern is over time reduced executive function and drive. I&#039;m concerned that over 5 years I might be generally okay with the status quo were as maybe off fin I&#039;d have started a business, made some moves y&#039;know? If you are wondering why I tolerate any side effects what so ever I believe that everybody will get some side effects on fin, but whether you can tolerate them or not is when they become a problem. I used to jerk off 6 times a day and want sex 2-3 times a day, like I had a problem. Now my libido is a lot more matched to my partners and I&#039;m happy with sex twice a week and I jerk off a couple of times a week. I used to drink way too much, like it was bad for my health and now I drink one or two drinks a week and I rarely get anywhere approaching drunk which is also an improvement in my book. The muscle aches suck, like I get pain in my knee and I feel tired and I feel fucking old, but I&#039;ve started some daily cardiovascular exercise and I figure that losing a little weight and getting in better condition will help with that and also be a better idea in the long run.

My last ex had sex with me on the first date. Our second date was a trip to the pharmacy because the condom split. That was how she lost her virginity (allegedly, but I believe it). After that, she went on the pill and we had sex a lot. The fact that she always wanted sex and would always provide sex was attractive to me because she was demonstrating that I was the man and was in charge. All guys want their girl to be a lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets, a personal whore who only has sex with them. It&#039;s just the way it is. And then you know, she would always moderate her behaviour so that she was nice, demure, and eager to please. I respected her for that because these days most women are like bulls in a china shop when it comes to relationships; they tend to lack any gracefulness, or at least tact. I don&#039;t want arguments, bargaining, complaining etc. in a relationship. Either I&#039;m the man or I&#039;m not, and for me feminine behaviour is about accepting that and behaving accordingly. <br><br>Kind of ironically, I find it&#039;s usually girls with fairly high body counts who don&#039;t give it up easily, because they&#039;ve been pumped and dumped and have built up layers of defence to prevent that.

If you&#039;re not living together, making major financial decisions together, or having sex until you&#039;re married, then the only reason a guy has to stay is how much he likes YOU. And clearly, if he decides to marry you based off of that kind of relationship, he liked you enough to want to spend the rest of his life with you. That&#039;s a very strong basis for the marriage, because you already know he likes you without sex being involved. <br>This is a big part of why people who wait, even controlling for religion, both divorce less and have happier marriages.

In my experience, an easy way to go about it is to pick one eye and keep looking into that one, that way you avoid any possible &quot;which eye should I look at&quot; issues.<br>For sexual projection, second, start thinking sexual thoughts while around women. Make it a point to try to actually get somewhat physically aroused when you are out and about. And when you make eye contact with a woman, think about fucking her. This is sort of like you are &quot;flashing&quot; your sexual intent right into her through the eye contact. Make some longer-than-usual eye contact with her and while you&#039;re doing it think about doing some sexy things with her or to her. This will send the right communications to her and put you into the right sexual frame of mind. You can even do it while you&#039;re talking about stuff that is not sexual on the surface, or you can mix it with some sexually charged language if you want. You can do it from across a room or you can do it from a foot away.

Weed is really great it pushes the fun button in your brain and makes dopemine reward effortless. It makes just sitting and spacing out really pleasant, so it&#039;s good for relaxing. Too much and you get paranoid or you pass out and feel groggy. It can contribute to mental issues if you use it a lot for years, and it&#039;s very addictive, contrary to what some people think.<br><br>Alcohol is different, it gets rid of all of your anxiety. Like if you&#039;re having a panic attack, taking a shot of booze will get rid of that feeling instantly. You feel less restricted and more able to just go out and get things. Nothing feels impossible for a short 20 minutes or so. You can just chill and be charismatic and flow freely. But after like an hour you start to feel sorta bogged down, so you take another shot. After about 3 shots/beers/glasses of wine you feel drunk. After 4 shots it stops really helping your mood but you have to keep drinking to not feel the come down (which feels kinda bad). If I buy a bottle of wine I end up drinking the whole thing in one night just to keep the buzz going until I fall asleep. This drug is also addictive, but I&#039;ve never had a major problem with it. If I&#039;m in a bad mood it actually improves things and helps me reset. People learn to rely on it too much though and don&#039;t work on themselves enough because it&#039;s such a strong drug (like a prescription basically) that it can mess with your ability to function without it. It creates a coping mechanism inbalance. Instead of whining about having a shitty day, you drink.

If the therapist is woke (which many of them are), they often start babbling away about the neurotypical world and how the autism makes you not part of that world, again doing the opposite of what a diagnosis is supposed to do which is solving the issue.<br>Anyway, like 99 % of all &quot;autists&quot;, the therapies will teach you things that you aren&#039;t struggling with and therefore, it&#039;s not going to help you. If you were a child, they would just electroshock you and force you to obey commands by using a clicker or some other stupid device. Our liberal diversity-loving civilization surely is obsessed with ensuring total obedience in children that develop &#039;atypically&#039;. From my point of view, it&#039;s just a proof that all the talk around tolerance is a farce meant to divide people.<br><br>Anyway, it&#039;s precisely what happens when the private sector and a number of funny private corporations attain full control over a diagnostic category. You see the same shit currently happening with ADHD where they&#039;re now pushing for life-long stimulant treatment despite the fact that stimulant drugs are associated with depression, iatrogenic bipolar disorder and early-onset Alzheimer&#039;s.<br><br>Regarding your issue, all I can recommend is what I&#039;m doing myself. Deal with people, talk to people, don&#039;t isolate yourself. If you&#039;re not into the whole fake-smiling fake-empathizing thing, this really is just you being you and there&#039;s nothing wrong with you.

Personally, I wouldn&#039;t take those. I&#039;ll need to see what the pills look like (to confirm they are what&#039;s listed), the strength, and what your weight is in order to see how many you would need to take. As they&#039;re for fish, they won&#039;t be the same strength as the kind normally prescribed. Taking expired medication isn&#039;t too bad, but for antibiotics, I&#039;m not sure how viable those pills are now.<br><br>In regards to oral abscesses: I had one when I took was in the middle of nowhere and didn&#039;t have insurance. A friend told me to swish coconut oil around my mouth for 20mins daily (this is called oil pulling. Spit this out in the trash and NOT in the sink), gargle with warm salt water on the hour every hour, and keep a warm black tea bag on the abscess, preferably overnight too if possible. Cleared it up in a jiffy. However! This is risky. I would recommend that you see a doctor so then it doesn&#039;t get potentially worse.
