IT&#039;s like I could tell she wasnt&#039; into it but we still did it anyway. I should have just listened to her when she said no. Because in fact she did say no like two times, until I got a yes out of her and the whole thing ensued.

He had a really thick accent, and one time he came in school wearing a yellow shirt with a red stripe. His accent and the shirt reminded us of Rolf from Ed Edd n Eddy, so we started bullying him by constantly calling him Rolf after that and ostracizing him about it. It was pretty fucked up in retrospect. Eventually we were barred from recess for a week because he told the teacher about it. We all ganged up on him the first day we could go to recess again. He started to run away but I pinned him to the ground and I forced him to eat the sawdust on the ground while I screamed some joke about harvesting crops.

I did something during my cleaning that could have cause a very serious fire - I won\u2019t say what so as not to be too identifying, but I could have burned down the house and killed everyone. When I realized this, I was completely consumed with guilt. It got to the point that I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep and I felt too unclean to even go to the bathroom without having a panic attack. All I could do all day was be a nuisance to him. I also tried to shoot myself with his father\u2019s gun one night, but he never found out about that.

Please try seeing someone who specialises in victims of child sexual assault if you can afford that, you can build up a relationship over time and tell them what you need to. You can say you&#039;re not comfortable going into all the details right away. It will be scary because you carry a lot of shame and fear of being perceived as a monster, but you aren&#039;t.

When we talked about our relationship she said she doesn\u2019t want anything serios, but likes talking to me and \u201clikes me as a person\u201d (w/e that means). That was last year on the new year. At that time told her that I don\u2019t want to text her/talk with her anymore since I\u2019ll get attached for no reason. Last year in summer I had a talk with her again because she started giving off mixed signals, being flirty and hanging around me when we were in the same context. She said she doesn\u2019t like me enough to want to have a relationship with me, and that she still doesn\u2019t want anything serious from me. And basically that was it, however when we happen to meet she is still flirty sometimes. In live settings she\u2019s just moving from one guy to another, talking for a few minutes to get her attention then moves on to hang out with her friends or some dude that happens to give her more attention.<br>I want her\u2026 however I can\u2019t force her to like me, or trick her into being with me for a few months.

Remember that people don&#039;t just decide to break up one day, they think about it for a long time, often over 6+ months. By the time you get the news that your relationship is in trouble, it&#039;s often too late as a result. If she&#039;s not will to talk about it and her mind is made up, there&#039;s very little you can do.", "time": 1672918863, "resto": 28050326}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28050222, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)19:17:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i keep having delusions of a rich white blonde girl that wants to date me. why is this happening", "filename": "B4312079-5071-4186-B868-1DA2909EB4B1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 530, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 176, "tim": 1672877858913105, "time": 1672877858, "md5": "4JFnFCjve8aZdnl2Mg8KTg==", "fsize": 141414, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-keep-having-delusions-of-a-rich-white-blonde", "replies": 9, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 28050785, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)21:41:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1672886469, "resto": 28050222}, {"no": 28050793, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)21:43:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28050222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28050222</a><br>Let\u2019s start with some context.

I never thought I would be feeling the way I do towards my friend but here we are.<br>I think I&#039;m just going to let it fade. I had a really, really good time hanging out with her yesterday and I felt really warm and nice inside. Literally non-stop smiling. But this is unhealthy, I just have to assume she doesn&#039;t share anywhere near that same feeling and straight up asking her would just do more harm than good. Also I failed to mention that she off-handedly mentioned her boyfriend once but I literally know nothing about this dude and it really had no bearing on what I was feeling. Had no idea she had one before setting up the date (I&#039;m calling it that, fuck you) but I don&#039;t really care.<br>I&#039;m going to seriously evaluate my relationship with my girlfriend as well. I love her, I really do, but I do not know how much longer I can be the support system for her to not even be happy, but just to survive with her depression. It hurts me to see her like that but I&#039;ve given so much already that I don&#039;t know what else to give. I realize now this is why I felt so sidelined by the frankly amazing time I had with my friend. I do not want to let it fade, I want to hang out with her more, I want to get to know her more, I want to go on dates and I want to talk about gay nerd shit. And so on. But it is, in all likelihood, a bad idea. Maybe I&#039;m just trading a potentially devastating heartache for a less poignant one. Maybe I&#039;m missing out on what could be an amazing friendship regardless of feelings. I don&#039;t know.<br>Also, she lurks here.

I wished to leave in order to finish up high school, lasting only 6 months in total. It was a great way of delving into customer service as a whole, which came in handy later on. Afterwards I was enrolled in a similar position, albeit not in IT, working for about a year in X company, and then on changing to Y company for a total of 2 years. I went to college in 2018, hence the gap on my resume , but the pandemic made me change plans. I had to pause my studies to help out in the house, as well as taking care of some family.

I was working for a medical clinic downtown as a patient coordinator. Part of my job was to fill potential patients up with the grand scheme of things. How we operated, our prices and such, and ocassionally solving issues with scheduling. We usually get people from other cities wanting some cosmetic proceedure, and this lady called us distressed, talking about how the proceedure our main doctor looked &quot;off&quot; after a while, asking what to do. She was obviously panicking, and wanted some guidance. What I did was reassure her we could do something for her with no issues, being careful not to reflect her type of energy nor giving in to her anger, asking her for a complete list of events. After she explained, I asked her if she could, for legal paperwork sake, as well as for scheduling another proceedure, if she could send us an email detailingwhat exactly was she expecting, the issues she had with our work, as well as a timeline on what exactly did our doctor mention to her. At the end the entire ordeal was solved, with no major issues.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(4) I would say a bit of anxiety. I consider myself as self reliant, and can work lots of problems on my own, or at least would like to, but on ocassion there are certain matters in which I cant find a way of going around them, and I&#039;m usually overwhelmed by them. For those moments I usually depend on my superiors to give me a hand, and help me through the process. I think I could also benefit from being better at bulding rapport with people.

You will also need a tuner and a foot stool or support of somekind. I use a cheap On stage FS7850B. Its been working well for a couple years now. If you have a particularly long torso or something you can also pick up a ergoplay but try out the footstool first. You need a tuner too but I just use guitar tuna on my phone. <br><br>It is very very important to stretch your arms,wrists,fingers and warmup before playing and practicing do NOT skip this part I learned the hard way. You only need to practice 15 or 30 min a day starting. Make sure you have your fingering and posture down perfectly you need to have a very strong foundation on proper fingering and technique. <br><br>You do not need to take lessons books and youtube is more than enough if you do not plan on going pro I recommend &#039;This is Classical Guitar&#039; on YouTube.<br><br>I cant think of much else but if I do I will reply to my post. also listen to dis song :DDD.

Eat enough. Not enough people respect will power isnt as real as they think. Youre sharing control of your body with an animal who wants tou alive. Starve, and youlll binge eat before bed.<br><br>2) no fucking joke: eliminate all simple and processed carbs (sugars, white breads etc) and replace them with complex carbohydrates (if you dont opt for keto), whole wheat foods and such.<br><br>When yku eat high sugar or processed carbs you sugar spike and this causes a chemical chain reaction and not only puts on weight but also increases your appetite. Youll eat more throughout the day.<br><br>So a complex carb has a double effect. First your body actually takes time to get tbrough it, so the sugar produced is slow released and you actually *use* all those calories, you also dont spike, and your ghrelin hormone production normalizes. Youll be less hungry throughout today and less inclined to crave shitty snacks.<br>Anyway do keto diet. Follow it well.

Essentially, I (20M) have been close friends with a woman (19W) for just about 3 years now, with a cut in contact from Dec 2020 to Jun 2021, and from Jul 2021 to Jun 2022. My problem is, I&#039;ve loved her for 2 years, never once alluded to it, only recently confessed and proposed a few workarounds (long distance, cross-continent) and now we have planned to cut contact for good due to recent developments with her relationship status. I&#039;ve accepted (or at least coming to terms) that things will be over for us despite all of our struggles and personal development and long close friendship. The news is, soon after we started talking again, she met someone on a discord server in Nov 2022 and has agreed to be his girlfriend at the start of January, soon after I revealed my true feelings to her. I was rejected on her terms, noting personality differences, with her saying I could not offer her something that she couldn&#039;t develop herself. She has become incredibly involved with MBTI and it was actually on a server for discussing MBTI that she met this new guy. What really devastates me is not the fact that rejected me, but rather the fact that she thinks of all our experiences together from the past 3 years with this neutral overly analytical lens. She assured me that this was not the case, but everything she&#039;s said up to this point only serves to uphold this. As if all the things we did were for nothing, or more importantly, meant nothing to her other than as a vehicle for her personal development, like a &quot;test subject&quot;. I know my judgment is clouded by strong emotion, but I just wonder if things are not what they seem, and there was something more I could have done.", "filename": "rainiscoming", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1263, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 246, "tim": 1672872058694244, "time": 1672872058, "md5": "z0rM9tB7oGZZTXUapmzBWQ==", "fsize": 138768, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hi-all-it-would-be-immensely-helpful-to-get-a", "replies": 41, "images": 23, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 28049593, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:42:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28049586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28049586</a><br>Continued, I think one of the reasons I&#039;m still so hung up on this is because the guy she&#039;s now coupled with is pretty much exactly like myself, humour, interest in long and involved conversation, and listens to her actively. But then he&#039;s also geographically displaced (USA - Middle East, compared to me, Australasia - Middle East) and is fairly older, at around 23 or 24. He&#039;s been described as much less responsible than I am, and this is totally at odds with how she&#039;s described her life aspirations and careful planning. She told me about her new relationship and said she was actually wanting more self responsibility and notes her personality as &quot;spontaneous&quot; and doing things without much consideration for consequences, despite everything up to that point being completely the opposite, with her saying she has a large focus on being responsible and careful in her planning. But to get back to the point. I feel like this whole thing is a write off, but I still love her so much and I think that this period in her life is her having become reckless and rash. She is Muslim, and the original reason we cut contact (Dec 2020) was because she felt our close friendship was too close and typical to a full relationship, and was worried that if she were to get married it would be considered emotional cheating, I obliged, because I am catholic and I didn&#039;t want to dispute this because it felt fair and we were young.", "time": 1672872132, "resto": 28049586}, {"no": 28049604, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)17:43:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28049593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28049593</a><br>This was the case even in 2021 where we reconnected and I made a huge effort to be a better friend, before ultimately cutting contact for the same reason, although this time it was my decision. It wasn&#039;t until 2022 that she suddenly decided to be less responsible and messaged me, wanting to be close friends again, citing that her views changed and she was more relaxed with her religious and personal views. I think this is where I made a mistake and held back emotionally in the close friendship because I was suspicious but also wanting to hide my now very concise feelings of love and optimism, so that she wouldn&#039;t &quot;get spooked&quot; and cut contact with me before hearing what I have to say. When I did confess, that pretty much happened just as I predicted, although she was willing to talk through email and discord calls. I understand that of course she&#039;s not obligated to give me a chance at trying a relationship, but I felt as if I was offering so much to her only for her to not be willing to discuss this with me. I feel like it would be rather silly to be all like &quot;b-but i was such a nice guy!! why didn&#039;t she pick ME?? that BITCH&quot; but her relationship with this guy just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me. She would have also rejected him based on the views she has about relationships and long distance, but she didn&#039;t and I just don&#039;t know why if she was willing to try things with this guy, why not at least discuss the same with me?
