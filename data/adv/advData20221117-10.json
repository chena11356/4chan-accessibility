The prototypical Chad and &quot;Chadlite&quot;, a man with genetic advantages, i.e. height, bone structure (broad shoulders, strong jawline), race, low hairline, etc. If a man possesses these physical characteristics, he can afford to be scrawny (although ottermode is preferred) or even out of shape (&quot;dad bod&quot;). He can also get away with being a little shy and socially awkward. A woman will make these allowances because he&#039;s hawt and good breeding material.<br>#2. A dangerous and roguish persona aka &quot;the badboy&quot;. Their profile is marked by impulsiveness, high-extraversion, low-agreeableness, low-empathy and hypermasculinity. They are not necessarily goodlooking, although at times they can be unconventionally attractive. They are possessed of superficial charm and excel at manipulating female emotions. Woman from all walks of life are suckers for badboys. They often ignore the red flags and make a calculated risk to date men like this, despite the risk of abusiveness. Of course, women will deny this but what women say they want is at odds with what they truly desire.<br>#3. Betabux. A normie with a good job and stable income. Women settle for these guys, particularly later in life when they&#039;ve been pumped and dumped too many times by #1 &amp; #2. Badboys typically don&#039;t make for the best providers, after all. The majority of relationships will fall into this category.<br>A combination of the above would be ideal. That&#039;s a woman&#039;s ultimate fantasy (e.g. Fifty Shades of Grey) but it&#039;s not realistic. For that reason, a woman&#039;s tastes will fall into one of the above, depending on her priorities and present situation. If you do not fall into at least one of these categories, you will struggle to ever have a girlfriend.

I was similar in my second year, especially because it was 2020 and I&#039;m the sort of person who benefits from face-to-face teaching. I was taking a full course load, 4 units a semester, and dropped down to 3, since that&#039;s the lowest you can go without going part-time. It really helped me, I had more free time, I was more on top of and aware of when things were due. I was just too used to high school, where they spoonfeed you and constantly remind you about stuff, and was totally unprepared for how much self-motivation was needed. I got a 93 on an essay for one class and an overall 67 in the class because the weighting on weekly quizzes and class participation (two things I definitely did not do) was so high. Can you drop down to even one less unit? It will make your degree a bit longer, I went a semester longer than I should have and it delayed my masters plans by a full year since I want to start with the rest of the cohort, but it was worth it.

I have a suspicion that i&#039;m just there for validation. They flirt with me all they want but anytime I say anything flirty they stop me and say im being weird. They also said they have like another girl which no one would say if they liked someone. It just doesn&#039;t quite feel reciprocated, and I feel as though they sees me as a good friend.
