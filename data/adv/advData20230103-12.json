From her Instagram posts she looked pretty busty but angles are king. In real life she&#039;s just a fatass. We didn&#039;t have much chemistry, no harm no foul.<br><br>So now instead we turn to my cousins. The one (call her K) [22F] is my second cousin and is a 5&#039;2 blonde with petite features but thick legs. She&#039;s actually an identical twin but the other twin didn&#039;t show up to the party. She had an alcoholic druggie father and a prostitute mother, so in their childhood, I was basically like a surrogate father to them. I&#039;ve noticed K has gotten increasingly nervous around me as time has gone on and we&#039;ve grown up. Always makes a point to hug me extra long and tried to hug me several times throughout whatever family event we meet up at. Has always admired me like some sort of god, which is pretty nice.

Unlike K, went through a long period where I barely saw her. In that time all of a sudden she got really busty and very attractive. Super socially awkward. Has only been in one relationship in her life that was some weird-ass polyamorous thing with a strange couple in NYC. I&#039;ve known about K&#039;s crush for a long time but my ex-wife actually picked up on H&#039;s crush for me much faster than I did and she was sort of jealous of her. Since we&#039;ve started meeting together again semi-recently we&#039;ve become really close friends really quick.

When H arrived, I was pretty eager to catch up with her. Asked her if all was well in the polycule, but they had all broken up. Sort of light teasing and banter. She started to get really touchy feely. (Grabbed both my shoulders and leaned into me when she was laughing after making a joke, etc.) K noticed this and I could see she was starting to get pretty bothered by it.

First, a bit of context; Ex-gf of three years left me a guilt riddled mess after giving me the boot. Tore my head apart for weeks in self blame after she gave me the whole spiel about how great I was and how she&#039;d need months / years to get over me, that it was her fault and not mine and bla bla bla. Lo and behold, got a new guy in two weeks. Now that I&#039;m fully done with any feelings I had for the bitch, I want to make up for time lost agonizing by getting my head back in the game. As it stands I&#039;ve got two options: <br><br>#1 is a long time friend who everyone in my peer group has banged; she&#039;s extremely hot, (allegedly) great in bed and already pretty flirtsy with me. Extremely fun to be around, talkative as hell, we have a lot of shared interests, like the same music and understand eachother&#039;s terminally online dogshit humor super well. However, she&#039;s pretty much completely airheaded, incapable of taking anything seriously and has not the faintest clue about what to do with her life. Couldn&#039;t imagine her working / studying anything.<br><br>#2 is an old highschool pal (I&#039;m 22). Randomly met her on the street one day and decided we should grab a drink and catch up. Conversation went swimmingly, talked nonstop for three hours before she had to go to some family thing, but not before asking if I&#039;m free to meet again next week. Didn&#039;t act like she has a boyfriend, mentioned spending new years alone with a couple of gal pals so I assume she&#039;s free for the taking. She&#039;s pretty good looking and really sweet, trouble is we have pretty much zero shared interests. I&#039;m an Internet addicted retard and she&#039;s as normie as they get.

I just interacted with her, mostly asking questions, and occasionally chipped in when the group was talking. She had this lapdog, I was the only one interacting/playing with it, the dog made me feel more comfortable in the situation. Well I guess she thought that was attractive according to her, and we ended up hanging out a few more times after that, just the two of us.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she only wants to fuck</span><br>Same shit stg. I denied sex twice within a period of a few hangouts and we had this super fun day, she planned to take me to a pet store she wanted to go to but it snowballed into getting coffee and going to a shitload of other places too. Eventually she was like &quot;idk I don&#039;t like the whole boyfriend thing it scares me, but I know you don&#039;t want to just be fuck buddies. Idk if I want to keep doing this&quot; and I was like &quot;hahaha why? Isn&#039;t this fun? I like when we go do stuff together it&#039;s nice, right?&quot; That one line of dialogue put her on the spot so hard, she realized she was being retarded and decided to give it a chance. We had sex for the first time that evening I believe. Turned into a 2 year full-on relationship.<br><br>We all get nervous, even the dudes with killer game. I do not have killer game, but I was genuine and knew what I wanted, and she picked up on that. There will always be butterflies. You cannot avoid getting nervous. Just &quot;123 go&quot; it.<br><br>And don&#039;t worry about hunting women literally all the time, you&#039;ll find one quicker waiting for an opportunity to present itself than you will shotgun cold approaching or even fretting about it.

I feel ridiculous but I get incredibly jealous of my 11 year old stepdaughter when she cuddles/hangs on my husband. Here\u2019s some context: <br><br>So I came into my stepdaughter&#039;s life when she was 7. We get along fine but I remember even at that point having an intense feeling of jealousy one day when I came in and saw her and my husband spooning on the couch, taking a nap together. It should\u2019ve been sweet and cute to me, but it made me feel awful. Most of the time they never cuddle, it\u2019s usually limited to hugs and hand holding and tickling, so when the cuddling happens it feels out of place from what I\u2019m used to seeing between them. <br><br>It gets waaay worse when we are around others, almost like they are putting on a \u201cshow\u201d of affection for the audience. Recently, my father in law stayed with us over Christmas for a few days and the ENTIRE time it\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t peel off of each other. Every time I turned around she was draped over his lap, hugging onto his arm and constantly (like every 15 minutes at times) saying \u201cDaddy? I love you.\u201d <br><br>It should be sweet, I should think it\u2019s cute and be happy they have a sweet relationship. It\u2019s just so off putting to me especially when it doesn\u2019t happen 85 percent of the time. And man, I\u2019m so jealous! I want my husband to give me some of that attention when it\u2019s happening and it legit feels like he\u2019s hugging onto another woman sometimes, despite my brain screaming at me that I\u2019m being a terrible person for feeling that way. And it makes me feel weird when I try to hold his hand or touch him in any way when he\u2019s in that mode with her because I almost feel like I\u2019m intruding on something. <br><br>What can I do to get over this? My solution when this happens is to keep it to myself and act like nothing is wrong because I would feel so awful saying a word of this to my husband.

For one thing it criminalizes perfectly healthy sexual relations that some teen girls inevitably have with older guys, forcing them to live with unnecessary shame and guilt and making some of them think they&#039;re literally victims of rape even when they would never think that if they lived in a more sane society that tolerated teenage sexuality as something natural and healthy. I think it&#039;s a serious problem that now even attraction to younger women is slightly taboo even when the woman is over 18. That creates a lot of unnecessary resentment in both sexes. Women with their hysterical outrage over men dating hot 20 year olds and men being denied opportunities to fuck the women they actually feel attracted to or having to pretend they don&#039;t fuck them or prefer to fuck them and nod along with hysterical women and brainwashed men.

Love and lust aren&#039;t the same thing. That you don&#039;t get an erection when your wife walks in the room anymore doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re not attracted to her.<br><br> It means you&#039;ve been in a relationship for 6 years and have failed to put in the necessary effort to keep the relationship exciting and passionate. This happens with every relationship that isn&#039;t maintained. A long term relationship is hard work, and the infatuation of the honeymoon period is unsustainable beyond 18 months at the extreme limit. <br><br>You&#039;re getting bored, like the 10 year itch and that isn&#039;t unusual. I have no doubt in my mind that if you put in the effort to bring back the spark into your relationship that your view of your wife will change dramatically and you&#039;ll be initiating sex again. Maybe you should consider couples therapy, or one of those couples weekends. <br><br>One thing to definitely try with her is to have sex every day for 2 weeks, and when you&#039;re doing it each of your should be fully focused on the others body. Give that a try. <br><br>I honestly think divorcing your wife over this would be a stupid immature mistake.

Given the woman you are with, I&#039;m going to guess the answer to that is no, but please do correct me if that assumption is wrong.

Beauty is only skin deep, even the hottest person ages and with age metabolism slows. You are with someone because you enjoy their company as a person, they&#039;re your best friend and a part of your family. Genuine love feels the same on relatives as non-relatives, it&#039;s an unstoppable bond. To you care how your mates look? Are you only friends with &quot;smoking hot&quot; people? Do you care how your parents and siblings look, are you trying to turn them into trophies too? I doubt it. I think you have some holes inside of you that you&#039;re trying to fill through empty jestures like a trophy wife.

Like 2 weeks to a month on the couch? I mean we&#039;re in a job crisis too right now, so it&#039;s not that hard to find a decent position moderately above minimum wage that&#039;ll train you on site rather than require a degree. Your savings will cover security deposit on a place and at least a month of rent, if they give you shit for having no credit or cosigner, scrounge up another month of rent to put down. GTFO of Oregon, it&#039;s a shithole for living cost and homelessness is horrible there for a reason. Try Idaho or Nevada or even Washington. Apply for a job in another state, and start searching for an apartment, tell the employer and landlord you are moving to said city and you should be able to nail a job and a place to go to before you even get there.<br><br>You could look into being a flight attendant, lots of open positions that make decent pay, you&#039;d have places to sleep. They might cover some basic expenses working there idk you&#039;d have to research it. I worked for Valvoline as a technician for a while and they had great programs to move and keep your job in another city/state, coed staff, good pay, and the job was easier than you&#039;d think. I was able to make it work as a renter paying ~$650/mo too. Not in Oregon tho lol.<br><br>You can use gym memberships to shower and exercise, your pay right now could tide you into a new job by paying for food and toiletries to clean yourself at said gym, and give you enough time to funnel absolutely all of your excess money after basic expenses into savings, which will help you build a launchpad to get back up. They have wall outlets for charging shit, laundromats too. Plenty of those places have microwaves for food as well.<br><br>Don&#039;t drag your feet. I&#039;d be looking for a higher paying job like my life depended on it if I were in your position. You don&#039;t want to be homeless at all, especially as a woman.<br><br>Good luck, I mean it.

Even if you&#039;re in one of the few areas that has common-law marriage, you have distinctly fewer protections and rights because he isn&#039;t actually committed to you.

Ended up with a guy who wouldn&#039;t let me get my hair cut. I didn&#039;t get a cut until I was 35. Even though it was long and I could pull it back into a ponytail, it barely touched my shoulders after all those years and the ponytail thickness was the size of my thumb if that gives you an idea of how fine my hair is and that was before it all started falling out!<br><br>I went back to pixie about a year ago after keeping it around ear length for a while because once I had to stop dying it, it just looked odd at ear length. It was very thin even for that, but dyed black, it wasn&#039;t as noticeable.

If people can stretch their ears to like 3 inches across you can definitely stretch a part of your skin that is supposed to stretch anyway.<br><br>Every day, ideally after a shower, stretch your foreskin back as far as you can (shouldn&#039;t be painful, just some discomfort at most) for like 15 minutes. If possible apply some kind of hydrocortisone cream to your foreskin a couple of times a day while doing this, you can get 1% over the counter in the form of vagisil, or prescription 2.5% which presumably is better but the 1% still helps but it can be done without any creams as well.<br><br>Basically you just stretch it every day. Sometimes it can be severe enough to require basically these progressively larger soft silicone inserts to put in and keep stretching for longer periods. There is a blog out there somebody has that is like the most extreme phimosis case possible and even he managed to stretch it and end up normal in just a couple of months. Whatever you&#039;re imagining, that dude&#039;s case was 10x worse than the worst phimosis you can imagine right now.<br><br>Another anecdote about how resolvable this is. There are men who do &#039;Foreskin Restoration&#039; where they literally have already been circumcised but stretch their remaining skin back out to act as foreskin again.

I before that,in primary school i remember talking to a girl,she was one of the few people i really got along with back then and we used ro spend a lot of time alone...and somehow an idea popped into my head that i had &quot;made a brain exchange&quot; with someone from america,a hollywood actress from a show that was popular between 2014ish to 2016. The dog with a blog,thats how ut was called. But i never told the classmate the full name of the actress,just the family name. Thats just one of the many many many oddities in my life. I also remember knowing about the books of jonas,job and joil(?) From middle school Without reading the bible at all. Idk what that means. In fact i remember writing a short story in my notebook about how hitler conquered america and how i was hitler and by killing america i was butchering two people i absolutely loathed,a guy from primary school and a girl from middle school. On top of hitler there was heinrich himmler who was alive and was &quot;always at work&quot; and then there was a guy called mark leclerq (i took his name from a game called resistance retribution) and he was reading from the book of job. He also had a wife called jeanette. Now that i think in retrospective the three of them could have represented a mockery of the holy trinity...but i did not mean it like that. Oh and there was also goebbels who was &quot;the liar of the liars&quot; and this single line was cut with a line and above it there was written &quot;the best orator&quot;. I didnt read all that much about goebbels but i couldve skimmed over that somewhere. Idk.
