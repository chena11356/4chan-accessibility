You can learn discipline by creating a schedule based around what you want to accomplish and being consistent. You need to actually realize that the only way to be good at something is to stop complaining and do it though. That\u2019s not something anyone can help you with.

Goals and passions don&#039;t have to be some innate quality, it can be constructed, you can &quot;convince&quot; yourself to regard a mild interest as a worthy goal.<br>The goal doesn&#039;t need to be work, education or money related. I almost feel dirty for having to point out this -- to my eyes -- self-evident rejection of a wagedrone mindset. Maybe your goal is moving to Japan, whatever. <br>But you don&#039;t even try to conceptualize and, blogging here, articulate a possible concrete goal.<br>If you can&#039;t think of one, no one can help you. Visualize your life as a trajectory: if you keep doing what you are right now, you keep doing what you are doing right now. You said you aren&#039;t happy like this. Ergo, you need to input alternate target coordinates.<br>Yeah yeah I know &quot;at least others can come up with these kinds of goals as well&quot;, &quot;I know I am not ESPECIALLY miserable, but from my perspective, the difference to a &#039;true/cliched&#039; miserable state doesn&#039;t matter&quot;.<br>Shut up. Shut your internal monologuing. This is literally just ruminating. It accomplishes nothing. It&#039;s the hallmark of the 110 IQ word-thinker type (I am not trying to insult you). You don&#039;t NEED to monologue, or quasi-monologue by blogging here (I am not saying you should stop seeking this kind of dialogue about your problems -- or continue).<br>Also, I don&#039;t think what you expressed truly strikes me as ADHD (due to lack of information -- you sound like a rather generic NEET case, currently), but you might as well try to get diagnosed. I think at the very least you are such a borderline case that wouldn&#039;t need meds (especially if you don&#039;t have aspirations in very involving academic subjects), but with them you could be easily pushed over the edge to become successful.", "time": 1676289308, "resto": 28247009}, {"no": 28341043, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:26:38", "name": "Sean", "com": "<a href=\"#p28247009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28247009</a><br>Just get a job, savings, gf, maybe a few relationships of other kinds, and then find your passion for writing or studying islam or something.

For example, an insecure kid in school that\u2018s been called a giraffe for being tall and skinny might start to hunch over, wear baggy clothes, feel very unsure of their physical appearance and start to resent coming to school because of the bullying whilst a confident kid can get the same comment and react with \u201eoh yeah?

We orphans (or kids with both absent parents) want to have a family, and yearn to belong due to the abandonment we suffered from an early age, but it&#039;s also important to make sure we don&#039;t continue this cycle. Get in contact with your government in order to get food stamps or any welfare that can help your child move forward, and start working a part time job or something to maintain the kid once he arrives.

The honeymoon period will always be magical, but there is always a love differential in any relationship, and when the dust settles its always painful. You will grow to resent her if she loves you more than you love her, and viceversa. Love is fucked up man. Its in my personal opinion the most beautiful and intense thing in life, but its so tough to navigate. If you ever meet &quot;the one,&quot; please remember that you have to put effort into it consistently. Don&#039;t be overbearing but also enough rough-patch-ness will kill any relationship and there will always be one of you thats more interested in fixing things, and if that&#039;s you they you better work hard because, again in my personal opinion, there is nothing tougher to face than a hearbreak. Keep working on yourself and doing things that make you happy, soon someone will come your way, and when that happens best of fucking lucks.

This is a simple reality, but if your feelings are strong enough then you need to regularly keep her happy and keep the relationship fresh. Always make her feel special and loved, no matter how angry you get with her, which no matter how much you love her WILL happen. Her having a boyfriend means nothing, I promise you. Girls in relationships will always be receptive to men who make them feel happier than their boyfriends, and the sad truth is that you could be the best boyfriend but routine and mundanity will bore any girl (and guy). If you&#039;re ever feeling super connected to her, and you&#039;re looking into each other&#039;s eyes and smiling like idiots then just fucking kiss her, its either reciprocated or not that that point, whether she has a bf or not is irrelevant. Fucking women, but also fucking men, its not a gender thing its an options thing and hotter people will always have more options, its just the reality we live in.

I kept contact at a minimum and didn\u2019t chase her at all. The day of the date came around and she attempted to flake saying she was sick. Played it cool and she changed her mind. The date itself went well. Played my cards right to the best of my ability and she seems interested. Invited her over to my place to have some drinks and hang out afterwards (genuinely wasn\u2019t trying to fuck, I\u2019ve taken many girls to my place and usually don\u2019t pursue sex on the first date) to which she agreed. Got to my place and saw she had texted me apologizing and saying she went home because she really wasn\u2019t feeling well. Once again I played it cool and acted indifferent. Let a little over 36 hours pass before I texted her again saying I had a great time and that I\u2019m interested in going out again when we both have some free time (text was sent at around 10am this morning). Saw that she had seen the text a few hours ago. Feels like a definite game over to me. I only even texted her about a second date in case she got the wrong idea and though I was only wanting to fuck since I invited her over. At this point the only chance I see is that she trying to play games/hard to get (I noticed she is a bit odd), but I think that\u2019s just me being optimistic. Now granted she has taken several days to respond a couple times in the past when she seemed extremely interested. If she does end up ghosting me I just find it disrespectful as hell.

It&#039;s what&#039;s kept us alive as a species. If a man can&#039;t form an attachment to the mother of his child, he won&#039;t do all he can to protect them. If a woman can&#039;t form an attachment with her child, the child will die.<br><br>Men &#039;love&#039; women for their youth, beauty, purity, booba, ass, sexo. That&#039;s how they &#039;love&#039; women.<br><br>Women &#039;love&#039; men for his ability, resources, leadership, strength, reliability, assets and overall how he makes her feel. That&#039;s how they &#039;love&#039; men.<br><br>I am guilty of thinking &quot;she only loves me for my money&quot; &quot;she only likes me because I&#039;m funny&quot; &quot;he&#039;s only my friend because I listen to him&quot;.<br>You can get extreme one way examples of this, like a woman just using a ugly short man for his wealth and not caring for him, or a man using a depressed mentally ill woman purely for sex. <br>You also have to realize that as social creatures, we rely and survive on transactional relationships. The only real form of unconditional love I&#039;m aware of is perhaps the love a mother feels for her child. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for us to form relationships of unconditional love. Even familial &#039;love&#039; is still somewhat based in a selfish desire to ensure the survival of your genes.<br><br>But, here&#039;s the whitepill. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with this. I used to be sad from this, but now I&#039;m much better. Is it bad that a dog or cat &#039;loves&#039; their owner because the owner feeds them? Is it bad the owner &#039;loves&#039; the animal because they&#039;re cute and it makes them feel good?<br><br>So to answer your question, yes I think love is real but it&#039;s based on a two way transaction. As soon as I learnt to appreciate for what it is and let go of desiring true love I began to feel so much more free and not be so hard on others and myself. When I realized this I became social and opened up to people and people wanted to be with me.
