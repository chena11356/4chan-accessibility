She was an obsessive mother who was so afraid to lose her son, she put a fucking spell on him to ensure he could never be harmed, even though it ultimately drove him insane from the inability to feel ANYTHING. She loved her son to the point she would do anything for him and she was devastated over his death, especially because she knew deep down she was partially to blame for it for turning him into the the obsessive jackass he had become. Because of that, she doubled down on it being Kratos&#039;s fault as a coping mechanism. Her arc was about getting over her grief and coming to terms with it being her own fault that Baulder was unhinged and trying to kill her, thus prompting Kratos to step in and save her. The fact that you think it was poorly handled means you don&#039;t understand the concept of grief or what it can make people do, let alone the empathy required to understand how it may affect others.

The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the trigger buttons most of the traversal will go over a typical gamer&#039;s head. There&#039;s also Kojima&#039;s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his writing - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Hollywood movies, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these references, to realize that they&#039;re not just films - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Death Stranding truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the meaning behind Amelie&#039;s existential catchphrase &quot;Like Mario and Princess &#039;Beach&#039;&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to videogame classic, Super Mario Bros. 2. I&#039;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Kojima&#039;s genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Norman Reedus tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

There are some things where EU4 does things better on this count (EU3 has quite a few mechanics built around historical determinism, like Great Divergence being bound to happen, and that divergence not arising from simulation of any particularities of Western Europe, even flaunting its own mechanics like innovativeness&lt;-&gt;narrowmindedness -slider, but European technological advantage being hardcoded, whereas EU4 doesn&#039;t do a great job here with institutions and what not, but it at least tries), but overall I think EU3 goes for a more simulation-esque approach, which I think is better for its own sake because I like that sort of mechanics, but also because it&#039;s important for emergent narratives and alternative history RP.<br><br>Say, whereas EU3 tries to simulate population growth, EU4 has province development tied to the mana system: instead of provinces gaining population because of your good policies and booming trade, they gain what-kinda-sorta-maybe-translates-i<wbr>nto-population... because the ruler is good at diplomacy and just wills &quot;diplo development&quot; (translating into what probably ought to be some thousands of citizens) into existence with press of a button?

Despite the better foundation of EU3, EU4 is simply way more developed, particularly when it comes to playing non-European states, which increases the replayability quite substantially.
