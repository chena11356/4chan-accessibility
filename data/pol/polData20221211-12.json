There&#039;s three caveats to this mind you. <br>1.It&#039;s most definitely not just restricted to use against US citizens domestically. See ((pic related)) or for that matter is it purely used as a tool by alphabet agency glowniggers. After all remember there are such things now as PIC&#039;s(Private Intelligence Company). As well as certain NGO&#039;s, organizations, and even private individuals.<br>2. It&#039;s not called &quot;gaslighting&quot; but Targeted Asymmetrical Social Engineering. Which again has been around a lot longer and is in far wider use than you might think. Hell one could even make the argument that many social media &quot;influencers&quot; now act as part of a larger version. One that&#039;s more decentralized with a much less targeted instead focusing on a specific type of person or subject. Also another thing to keep in mind is the high and increasing number of Cluster-B personality nightmares are running around these days. Specifically those personality types where manipulative cunning is part of the package such as narcissists, APD(anti-social personality disorder), and BPD(borderline personality disorder). Add on top of the cluster-b nightmares all those Primary and Secondary Psychopaths that are also increasing becoming more common. For secondary psychopaths that&#039;s not surprising what with the state of modern &quot;families.&quot; What do you think some of the high functioning of all these predatory like people are like when they recognize each other huh?<br>3. While such practices do undoubtedly happen and as stated is more widespread than most realize. The reality is that most of those &quot;freaking out&quot; over it aren&#039;t actually the target of anyone.

They need to have it at the state level, too. Imagine how much better off California would be if the governor actually had to win a majority of counties in the state in order to get elected. Yet here you are suggesting that we take the same awful mistake that fucked California, and implement it at the Federal level. And how on earth do you expect it to do any good? You don&#039;t say, because you can&#039;t.<br>Furthermore California should also have a bicameral legislature, as mandated by its constitution, but it has been totally emasculated by a Supreme Court decision (Reynolds vs Sims I think?) that somehow was able to eliminate a state&#039;s natural right to have the same kind of legislature (bicameral) that we see at the Federal Level.<br>As for ranked-choice voting, surely you must know that it is a disaster that is responsible for Alaska electing democrats. Anyone pushing for a &quot;solution&quot; that causes Alaska to elect democrats is surely acting out of bad faith.<br>As for &quot;limiting the influence of big money in politics&quot; this is an old distraction trick. In reality, people do not have fair representation in the first place. That&#039;s why it&#039;s even possible for big money to buy political influence in the first place. Imagine if representatives actually had to meet with the people in their district and take notes on what they want. If representation was 30,000 to 1, this would actually be the case. But instead it&#039;s 700,000 to 1, and we all know those people do not have representation because it&#039;s physically impossible to represent 700,000 people.

Ten percent of them are considered violent, so last year alone 239 acts of violence were registered by Reich citizens.<br><br>&quot;We are not dealing with harmless crackpots, but with terror suspects who are all in custody now,&quot; said Faeser. At least 1,050 Reich citizens have already had their gun permits withdrawn, Faeser explained. The government will &quot;soon tighten gun laws further,&quot; she announced.<br><br>With a view to the arrested AfD politician Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, who was in possession of a Bundestag card even after she left the Bundestag in 2021, red-green-yellow politicians are also demanding better protection for parliament. The deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group, Dirk Wiese, wants to put the Bundestag&#039;s security concept to the test. &quot;This includes access authorizations for employees as well as for former MPs,&quot; said Wiese of the &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot;.

But there are large overlaps - from the rejection of our state to the pro-Russian attitude to hostility towards America,&quot; he said.
