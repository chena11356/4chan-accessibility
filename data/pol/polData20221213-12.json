Notwithstanding this clear ruling, it is possible to conceive of conditions in which a decrease in population levels is an urgent necessity and the use of an orally delivered contraceptive vaccine might be the only way of achieving that end without recourse to widespread sterilization.

It never occurs to them that they could be the masters of their own internal world. Yet, the Saint can maintain a sense of bliss even in the darkest circumstances. This is because the saint takes responsibility for his internal state.
