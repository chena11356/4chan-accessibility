You might use your five senses, measure data or design an experiment to test a hypothesis. Acquiring empirical evidence is a vital step in the scientific method, as it allows researchers to collect, organize and study data that results from their work. Empirical evidence is necessary for validating or disproving a claim, statement or hypothesis. A scientist usually begins their investigation by forming a hypothesis and then searching for empirical evidence that aligns with their educated guess. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s important for scientists and researchers to correctly recognize instances of empirical evidence, as this lends credibility to the research project or experiment. To ensure that you can accurately identify empirical evidence in an experiment or observation, ask yourself the questions below.

My sister and some of her dumb hoe friends got in trouble on a school trip (they ducked into a restaurant and got some food without permission) and our local pastor tried to make them do a humiliation ritual in front of the whole church. Public apology etc etc. My dad was okay with the school disciplining the girls but told the pastor to eat a bag of dicks because there are known cheaters (infidelity) and worse sitting in our congregation. Church is a hard institution to admire these days. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. real Christian</span>", "time": 1669646157, "resto": 406212731, "id": "qSzLocI9", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 406251804, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:37:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p406251189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;406251189</a><br>Niggers , actual black niggers, can go fuck themselves, you&#039;ve done enough damage and still continue to harass me , well fuck you !", "time": 1669646251, "resto": 406212731, "id": "ICeLFHh7", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 406253700, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:58:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p406212731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;406212731</a><br>Hire one of the slimy ambulance chasing kike lawyers to sue the family and the pastor for defamation.", "time": 1669647494, "resto": 406212731, "id": "hMyHgeO4", "country": "GB", "country_name": "United Kingdom"}], "last_modified": 1669647494}, {"no": 406233797, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)05:38:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "African showing his &quot;bbc&quot; to Irish people in the street since he imagine white men as non-treatening cuckolds and white women as something wanting a nigger in his mind", "filename": "1657257572589", "ext": ".png", "w": 539, "h": 592, "tn_w": 227, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669631918244661, "time": 1669631918, "md5": "U9tXLbnBXJHr/e/Lni7bjA==", "fsize": 280029, "resto": 0, "id": "ekylyIgQ", "board_flag": "CT", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "african-showing-his-bbc-to-irish-people-in-the", "flag_name": "Catalonia", "replies": 256, "images": 14, "omitted_posts": 251, "omitted_images": 13, "last_replies": [{"no": 406251990, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:39:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p406233848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;406233848</a><br>wow they paralyzed his ankle", "time": 1669646378, "resto": 406233797, "id": "NdWtgB2F", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 406252072, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p406233797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;406233797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anon browses /pol/ from Africa</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anon nootices BBC posts on first page </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;takes the bait posts seriously</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s my time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sells all his belongings</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;goes to bongland</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tries to offer his little pecker to female bongoloid</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets kicked in the dick</span>", "filename": "lel", "ext": ".gif", "w": 389, "h": 259, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1669646434158920, "time": 1669646434, "md5": "orOJMF+nhUTNA54+PMZQow==", "fsize": 1014883, "resto": 406233797, "id": "tMwp0EX+", "country": "FR", "country_name": "France"}, {"no": 406252089, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:40:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "you retards could have had a planet of human beings", "time": 1669646449, "resto": 406233797, "id": "NdWtgB2F", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 406253354, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)09:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p406251749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;406251749</a><br>We have only had 20 years of mass immigration and most are European and a good many western Euros who integrate and so do Eastern Euros who aren&#039;t just here to make coin and go home and build or buy a home.

Remember, I repeat myself for the 3rd time because people don&#039;t and won&#039;t realize this:<br>Corporations and internet didn&#039;t existed 20 years ago. That is literally in our lifetime if you are a millennial like me. We grew up without internet and mobile phones and now we are working remote. <br><br>Now I&#039;m not sure what are you referring to an enterprise. Is it a pasta factory? A pizza restaurant? I agree they are &lt;10 employees then. But an ENTERPRISE is a multi-national company with thousands of employees; what you want to say probably is that they have 10 Italians employees domestic and 1000 Romanians employees in Romania to avoid taxes or something. Remember again that your country is corrupt. That those 10 people would rather fill up their accounts with money instead of rising the salaries of local youngsters. <br><br>And remember what I said about computers and automation. A car engineer boomer was a real engineer, able to run calculus and differential formulas to get the optimal ratio of air and gas into the carburetor; a car engineer millennial or zoomer is just a CAD monkey, he just parametrize things in an already made software for him. <br><br>I also believe something more: that the millennial GDP is different of boomer GDP. The boomer GDP was based on railroads, roads, petrol and sky-scrapper construction. The millennial GDP is based on actors, NFTs, crypto, inflated real estate market. A cardboard shack in America costs half of million dollars; THAT IS GDP TODAY, folks. That&#039;s the &quot;wealth&quot; if you get my drift. While the equivalent of a half million dollars home in boomer time was a fucking castle.
