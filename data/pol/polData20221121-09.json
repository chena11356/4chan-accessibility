In 2001, Dr. Ariella Oppenheim, a biologist at Hebrew University, published the first extensive study of DNA and the origin of the Jews. Her research found that virtually all the Jews came from Khazar blood. The newest DNA research science from Dr. Eran Elhaik and associates at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, has confirmed that: The various groups of Jews in the world today DO NOT share a common genetic origin, and their genome is largely Khazar.<br><br>In fact, DNA research shows that the Palestinians actually have more Israelite blood than do the Khazar \u2018Jews!\u2019 These DNA research results should cause you to question everything you know about modern day Jews and the state of Israel. Today they\u2019re called Ashkenazi Jews, but they are a Jew by religion, not by blood. Most of them have Turkish-Mongol DNA. The 1905 Jewish Encyclopedia Vol. XI p 533, stated that \u2018probably 95% of the persons included in these estimates of Jewish populations are Ashkenazim\u2018.<br><br>The 1973 Jewish Encyclopedia documents that approximately 90% of the world\u2019s so-called Jews are Khazar. A.N. Poliak, Professor of Medieval Jewish History at Tel Aviv University, says that the majority of Eastern European Jews are Khazar and Japhetic in origin, not Semitic. Immigration statistics indicate approximately 90% of the world\u2019s so-called or self-styled \u2018Jews\u2019 living in 42 countries of the world are emigrants of Eastern European Khazar Jews.

For years I used to think it was me, my personality. But having thought about it I attribute being friendless to my mother beating me up every other day as a kid. It&#039;s kind of hard to put a smile on your face each day in school when you were physically thrown out the door in the morning and had your shoes and jacket tossed at you while you lay battered on the garden path. I hated everyone and everything and I saw everything in various shades of shit. Nobody wants to be friends with that guy. And if you leave school with no friends, it&#039;s devastating.

A bit of time goes by and they notice they&#039;re not hearing anything from upstairs- no footsteps, no music. Maybe they call their roomates on the phone and hear it ringing without answering. At this point, the girl that heard the thud gets anxious as she rememebrs the htud. What sounded like nothing much now seems sickingly suspicious as she htinks the thud she heard was a body hitting the floor, passing out from being black out drunk or soemthing.<br><br>Maybe they go upstairs and check the door and it&#039;s locked, maybe they just call a friend to ask what to do- it&#039;s been so long since she heard the thud it&#039;s not like a few more mins will change much, right? Either way, a third person (or a few others) arrive. Girl doesn&#039;t want to get in trouble for being a snitch but one of the visitors mans up and takes her phone and calls to report an unconcious person.", "time": 1669039128, "resto": 405355251,
