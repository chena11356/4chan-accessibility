They won&#039;t allow anyone to witness the search, oftentimes leaving victims standing outside on the street for the entire day in their underwear.<br><br>2.) They always take all of the telecommunications devices, thereby precluding the victims from exercising their Miranda rights.<br><br>3.) They always violate the civil rights of victims, peppering victims as they are handcuffed with degrading and often bigoted remarks. In cases where the victim is a member of a particular ethnic or religous group, they will make disparaging remarks related to their religion. Absent that, they find some other way to be insulting. Interrogations, which are supposed to be halted the instant an attorney is requested, stretch on for hours or days.<br><br>4.) If no evidence of a crime can be found, the FBI routinely charges victims of these illegal searches with everything ranging from obstruction to physically striking the agents. The idea that a dozen men in riot gear could be harmed by someone in their sweatpants not expecting a confrontation is laughable, but their word is treated as gospel while victims remain uncompensated and are often imprisoned regardless of guilt. Once arrested, the victims are pressured into taking plea deals, meaning that Americans have effectively lost their right to a speedy and fair trial. A person even having the option of taking a plea deal is an unbelievable injustice in and of itself and an absurd feature to include in a just legal system.<br><br>I am sure those of us who are old enough to remember recall this goofy dreamland website with the little drawings of the green men on it.
