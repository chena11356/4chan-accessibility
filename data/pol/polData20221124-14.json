Some traditonalist authors trace it back to the initiatic societies of ancient Egypt and specially to a sect worshipping the god Seth, whose symbols were the Crocodile and Leviathan [2] (i.e. aquatic animals), and also the Red Ass (see J.Robin Secret societies in apocalyptical rendez-vous, J.M.Allemand Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non and Seven towers of the devil etc.). Later the sect of Seth merged with various phoenician cults, specially with the bloody cult of Moloch. According to the French conspirologist of the XIXth century Claude Grace d\u2019Ors, this secret organization still existed many centuries after after the ruin of the phoenician civilization. In Middle Age Europe it existed under the name of \u201cMinstrels of Morgana\u201d, whose emblem was the \u201cDancing Death\u201d, or Dance Macabre. Grace d\u2019Ors affirmed that Luther\u2019s Reformation was conducted under the instruction of this sect and that Protestants (especially Anglo-Saxon and French) still remain under its influence. Jan Parvulesco believes that Giuseppe Balsamo, the famous Cagliostro, was one of the major agents of this secret Order which emerged at the surface at the end of the XVIII century under the mask of the irregular \u201cEgyptian\u201d Masonry of Memphis rite, later of Memphis-Mithra</span><br><br>Seth was the god of the Hyksos, who ancient Greco-Egyptian writers said were ancestors of the Jews. They also said that the Jews worshiped asses (Onolatry) and that Yahweh was a ass. The color red is associated with Seth because the Hyksos were foreigners who had a lot of red hair people and, curiously, Jews are one of the ethnic groups with the most red hair. Also, Crowley, Sebottendorff (founder of the Thule Society), HP Lovecraft&#039;s grandfather and Trotsky were members of the Memphis Rite.", "filename": "dugin-610x372", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 610, "h": 372, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1669297073334959, "time": 1669297073, "md5": "o4ZTTbhilxhWGZo0wmOdTA==", "fsize": 55593, "resto": 0, "id": "barGnm2m", "country": "BR", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-does-dugin-know-this", "country_name": "Brazil", "replies": 198, "images": 129, "omitted_posts": 193, "omitted_images": 129, "last_replies": [{"no": 405782753, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p405749612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;405749612</a><br>HES PART OF THE MYSTERY SCHOOL CULT LIKE ALL OTHER HIGH LEVEL ZOGBOTS", "time": 1669317760, "resto": 405749612, "id": "8cbD5o9S", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 405782870, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:23:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p405782433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;405782433</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fly and shit</span><br>I could but fuck you for putting words in my mouth.<br>You are a worthless piece of shit and will be throughout this life and the next.", "time": 1669317828, "resto": 405749612, "id": "y8YV9B7r", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 405783358, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:29:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p405782870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;405782870</a><br>I mean if the philosophy and teachings is all invisible shit or next life shit, or you have to do drugs to understand it shit, then, no, it&#039;s not real.", "time": 1669318153, "resto": 405749612, "id": "5gh5POu+", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 405783962, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:35:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p405780652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;405780652</a><br>My take is different than most.
