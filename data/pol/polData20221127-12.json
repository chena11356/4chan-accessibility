Despite this apparently niche future prospect of the internet, the kikes were already planning their fake pandemic - every year post 9/11 they got together in their globalist confab pandemic LARP wargames - Crimson Contagion, SPARS 2025, Event 201, Dark Winter, and so on. They had fake news casters, fake politicians, military and NGO jews literally roleplay out fake pandemics and create a wargame blueprint on what they want to do &quot;just in case&quot; such a cohencidence occurs. And just in case you&#039;re too lazy to look up and read through these documents, let me save you the time - EVERY SINGLE of these wargames had the same conclusion - gorillions died because the government didn&#039;t lockdown and vaccinate everyone quick enough.<br>Fast forward to 2019, where now every NPC boomer, braindead normie and vapid roastie is carrying a phone in their hand that&#039;s constantly connected to this internet, feeding them ZOGSLOP mind control 24/7.

And never before in all of recorded human history had such a plan even been possible - in the most unprecedented way ever, every single government, NGO, Big ZOGTech, mainstream media outlet launches the same constant barrage of propaganda, fear, lies, threats and gaslighting. ZOGBOTS start arresting people, beating them in the head with batons, locking them down in their houses, suspending any pretense of rights.
