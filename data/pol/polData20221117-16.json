Evil doesn&#039;t want to kill you, it wants to enslave you. It wants to use you. It wants you to do jobs for it while it sits in a mansion and enjoys luxury. The vaccine is not meant to kill. It is meant to preserve. It is a selection process for what I believe is the next genocide coming which will actually be us, the unvaccinated. More viruses will start coming and it is to wipe out the rebels who refused to conform. They gave out all those shots to protect their slave livestock. It is us, we are the freedom fighters. We are the naturals. We are the organic. But remember the one who makes the cure was the one who made the disease. They make you believe that viruses just appear out of thin air. I have accepted that I am cornered. I doubt any armed resistance will occur from a civil war, but I will admit I am prepared to die for what I believe in because everything has been taken from me anyway. I have nothing left to live for. However I am in the minority. I do not have children and therefore have nothing to lose. I know so many men who are not rebels or true freedom fighters. They are slaves and accept it. The same way niggers from africa became slaves. They were too scared to die in resistance. The nigger is too scared to die. As now a majority of Americans are. They are all so doped up they no longer have a conscience or willpower. They can no longer differentiate what is real from fake. The mainstream media controls the narrative. We are here in the virtual containment zone where everything we post is monitored. 4chan is the last and only place where true free speech is allowed.

The initial reporting was of an explosion... multiple people reported a loud explosion with their houses shaking. As soon as the family was identified as Syrian (with ties to Lebanon) the news articles immediately tried to blame natural gas. It was quickly apparent that it wasn&#039;t natural gas though, since that part of town doesn&#039;t use it. After that, they blamed an electric heater... the story is, the wife noticed a small fire behind the couch and by the time she went upstairs to get the husband, the entire house was on fire and none of the kids could get out. Obviously this is bullshit.<br><br>The top of the house was scattered everywhere, clearly in an explosion. All of the kids were upstairs, therefore perished. What was going on in that attic?<br><br>Within 24 hours all talk of the explosion was gone. Articles were swiftly and quietly edited and it was never mentioned again. The only traces of explosion talk (other than archives) are in foreign media articles.<br><br>Here is my question: Are there any laws on the books that would allow the government to lie about the cause if it were related to terrorism or perhaps even &quot;protecting minorities&quot;? If so, can you please name these laws for me?

And in AD 989, when Vladimir I converted from Slavic paganism to Greek Orthodox Christianity, the Russians became the \u201cChrist-bearing people,\u201d a character that would later give rise to ideas of Moscow as the \u201cThird Rome,\u201d following the fall of the first and the loss of the second, Constantinople, to the Turks in 1453. Out of this came the notion of \u201cHoly Russia,\u201d a mantle that, cynically or not, Putin does seem to be gesturing to, in order to give the Russian people some sense of identity and purpose, something that seems to have eluded them since the economic free fall of the late 1990s.

"You may not know it but an online proxy war is being waged online at this very moment in this very second on this very instance...I have analyzed hundreds of Doujins/hentai and 4chan boards /trash/ and /h/(entai) and seen thousands and perhaps even more posts of &quot;BL*CKED&quot; content. From my conclusion of these very doujins and posts on 4chan most of it seems to be from South Korea for some particular reason. If you look at nhentai.net most of the &quot;BL*CKED&quot; content are made by somebody that goes by the name &quot;r*t*t*t*t**&quot; (I censor it because of your own well-being) and he is from South Korea. This is strange, why? The Japanese has no specific taste towards race, a Japanese man might as be white and it does not originate from the supposed &quot;self-racial inferiority&quot; the Japanese is almost &quot;sterile&quot; when it comes to race, and the Japanese are white in their skin. The same goes for the Koreans but the strange phenomenon that exists here is that they are obsessed with colour of a Man. And they always paint the Man black. If you go the /trash/ or /h/ board you will see if you use SauceNao search function to trace the tracks of an image, the vast majority of &quot;arists&quot; who draw &quot;BL*CKED&quot; hentai are Korean. It&#039;s easy to dismiss this as a racial fetish thing. HOWEVER do you remember that I mentioned &quot;online proxy war&quot;, yes that&#039;s right, there are people who create this content in order to depress and cause mental health problems in White men and even Asians. South Korean &quot;BL*CKED&quot; battalions are being funded by the United States Forces Korea (USFK) under the United States Indo-Pacific Command. Yes the Army, the military. That&#039; why we keep seeing new content and content that have been edited. The USA and it&#039;s Army and SK counterparts are actively \u201csissyfying\u201d Whites and Asians by actively funding and creating ideological organisations and thinking, psyops and manuscripts like<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B*** Dictionary</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Slur Strokes/Earned Orgasms Program</span><br>and more disturbing ideological material.", "filename": "01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1078, "h": 1459, "tn_w": 184, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668714286172242, "time": 1668714286, "md5": "8p8t92Ovhjqe7qYD6raQZA==", "fsize": 581732, "resto": 0, "id": "+kFAlJD9", "country": "SE", "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-may-not-know-it-but-an-online-proxy-war-is", "country_name": "Sweden", "replies": 48, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 43, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 404895238, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:05:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404888088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404888088</a><br>Imaigne how disappointed OP&#039;s sissy would be after inviting a Turkish homosexual man named \u00d6zmur Pasha over and then seeing pic related.", "filename": "turkishman", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 652, "h": 941, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1668719136092947, "time": 1668719136, "md5": "FhsqTSaFkNHRZ22FjPjwsA==", "fsize": 64504, "resto": 404885050, "id": "jc/bhqG/", "country": "IS", "country_name": "Iceland"}, {"no": 404895438, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:07:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404885050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404885050</a><br><a href=\"#p404885144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404885144</a><br><a href=\"#p404885235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404885235</a>", "filename": "kneels", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668719234557099, "time": 1668719234, "md5": "m5mbofdjlV8GOY2ajo57xw==", "fsize": 226741, "resto": 404885050, "id": "nwxE1WhZ", "m_img": 1, "board_flag": "NZ", "flag_name": "Nazi"}, {"no": 404895680, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:09:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404885050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404885050</a><br>Its actually just fags and whores living/exploiting racist bdsm lifestyles it happens in every culture", "time": 1668719354, "resto": 404885050, "id": "ykdAJBlC", "country": "CA", "country_name": "Canada"}, {"no": 404896382, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404885050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404885050</a><br>Ways jews genocide goyim, must read<br><a href=\"/pol/thread/404866811#p404870266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404870266</a>", "filename": "1668578696121412", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 629, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1668719698050074, "time": 1668719698, "md5": "pbDJ9DlzvPN4RTZBJAwoGQ==", "fsize": 179629, "resto": 404885050, "id": "kSIdXBzv", "country": "AR", "country_name": "Argentina"}, {"no": 404896456, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:17:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404896382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404896382</a><br>Thank you.", "time": 1668719844, "resto": 404885050, "id": "+kFAlJD9", "country": "SE", "country_name": "Sweden"}], "last_modified": 1668719844}, {"no": 404864627, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)11:51:08", "name": "Mountain Lion 888", "sub": "GATE Thread", "com": "This is another gate thread.
