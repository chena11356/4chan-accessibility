I cannot prove or confirm this but considering I am quite the chess player I should share to you my theory. I think many of you have mistaken how evil works. Evil doesn&#039;t want to kill you, it wants to enslave you. It wants to use you. It wants you to do jobs for it while it sits in a mansion and enjoys luxury. The vaccine is not meant to kill. It is meant to preserve. It is a selection process for what I believe is the next genocide coming which will actually be us, the unvaccinated. More viruses will start coming and it is to wipe out the rebels who refused to conform. They gave out all those shots to protect their slave livestock. It is us, we are the freedom fighters. We are the naturals. We are the organic. But remember the one who makes the cure was the one who made the disease. They make you believe that viruses just appear out of thin air. I have accepted that I am cornered. I doubt any armed resistance will occur from a civil war, but I will admit I am prepared to die for what I believe in because everything has been taken from me anyway. I have nothing left to live for. However I am in the minority. I do not have children and therefore have nothing to lose. I know so many men who are not rebels or true freedom fighters. They are slaves and accept it. The same way niggers from africa became slaves. They were too scared to die in resistance. The nigger is too scared to die. As now a majority of Americans are. They are all so doped up they no longer have a conscience or willpower. They can no longer differentiate what is real from fake. The mainstream media controls the narrative. We are here in the virtual containment zone where everything we post is monitored. 4chan is the last and only place where true free speech is allowed. Once this is gone, there will be absolutely no hope.

From my conclusion of these very doujins and posts on 4chan most of it seems to be from South Korea for some particular reason. If you look at nhentai.net most of the &quot;BL*CKED&quot; content are made by somebody that goes by the name &quot;r*t*t*t*t**&quot; (I censor it because of your own well-being) and he is from South Korea. This is strange, why? The Japanese has no specific taste towards race, a Japanese man might as be white and it does not originate from the supposed &quot;self-racial inferiority&quot; the Japanese is almost &quot;sterile&quot; when it comes to race, and the Japanese are white in their skin. The same goes for the Koreans but the strange phenomenon that exists here is that they are obsessed with colour of a Man. And they always paint the Man black. If you go the /trash/ or /h/ board you will see if you use SauceNao search function to trace the tracks of an image, the vast majority of &quot;arists&quot; who draw &quot;BL*CKED&quot; hentai are Korean. It&#039;s easy to dismiss this as a racial fetish thing. HOWEVER do you remember that I mentioned &quot;online proxy war&quot;, yes that&#039;s right, there are people who create this content in order to depress and cause mental health problems in White men and even Asians. South Korean &quot;BL*CKED&quot; battalions are being funded by the United States Forces Korea (USFK) under the United States Indo-Pacific Command. Yes the Army, the military. That&#039; why we keep seeing new content and content that have been edited.

The initial reporting was of an explosion... multiple people reported a loud explosion with their houses shaking. As soon as the family was identified as Syrian (with ties to Lebanon) the news articles immediately tried to blame natural gas. It was quickly apparent that it wasn&#039;t natural gas though, since that part of town doesn&#039;t use it. After that, they blamed an electric heater... the story is, the wife noticed a small fire behind the couch and by the time she went upstairs to get the husband, the entire house was on fire and none of the kids could get out. Obviously this is bullshit.<br><br>The top of the house was scattered everywhere, clearly in an explosion. All of the kids were upstairs, therefore perished. What was going on in that attic?<br><br>Within 24 hours all talk of the explosion was gone. Articles were swiftly and quietly edited and it was never mentioned again. The only traces of explosion talk (other than archives) are in foreign media articles.<br><br>Here is my question: Are there any laws on the books that would allow the government to lie about the cause if it were related to terrorism or perhaps even &quot;protecting minorities&quot;?

I don\u2019t remember anyone else who was there. Headphones and drink both ring a bell<br><br>Sister was gate, too. Much smarter than I am in many ways.

Changed abruptly, became socially maladjusted and avoidant and a loner, which was after GATE was over. Became totally unambitious, figured out how to easily get B/B+ with minimal effort all the rest of the way though school, and that\u2019s how much work goes into everything\u2014 all that\u2019s persisted. <br><br>Maladaptive daydreaming began around middle school. Still daydream a tremendous amount but now very in control and appreciate it, use it deliberately for creativity reasons. Extremely visual imagination.
