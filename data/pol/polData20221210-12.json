What it is actually because of the coming transition of the gov-private relationship into the more gov ran industries like Russia and China has, together with a transition of fed relation to banking and media cartels (Jews). USA and EU will become more of a soviet union in the future, and because it&#039;s a recession in general to prevent a collapse of the economy by doing this transition. Jews will revolt and are revolting. This schism is becoming apparent for everyone to see. But people don&#039;t get it yet. This was in the works for several years. Main target - global transnational oligarchy which depends on a global trade and a cheap money issued by the fed. This is ending. Meaning a lot of Jews will be pushed and brushed aside for the mainstreet Jews takeover. Effectively triggering an infighting, like it&#039;s seen with a current propaganda. So you can expect a pre-ww2 scenario in global relations, considering some Jews with do business and finance the oppositions across the isle to challenge this transformation of the western system, while some Jews will be integrated into the new political system in the west. It&#039;s all about the economy, especially considering the media-military-corporate complex didn&#039;t succeed in couping Russia and achieving the geo political plans to control their competition - China. This schizm is now coming into full effect. So you can expect msm to start pushing truthful and based information, and against the US political establishment which is basically ran by the military industrial complex and fed. US in this process might end up being plunged into civil war or a full on tyrannical government.

It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man\u2019s genetic lineage\u2014the notion that a man\u2019s intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors. Racism claims that the content of a man\u2019s mind (not his cognitive apparatus, but its content) is inherited; that a man\u2019s convictions, values and character are determined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This is the caveman\u2019s version of the doctrine of innate ideas\u2014or of inherited knowledge\u2014which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. Racism is a doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version of collectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of animals, but not between animals and men. Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racism negates two aspects of man\u2019s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination.
