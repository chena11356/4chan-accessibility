This is apparently one of the most famous videos of a nuclear bomb test. Apparently this nuke was an UNDERWATER one (that&#039;s important), apparently below the surface of the water, underneath a barge. This footage is so famous that it&#039;s actually played multiple times in the &#039;Dr Strangelove&#039; final nuclear apocalypse scene.<br><br>Watch this video first: https://youtu.be/MWBMImBA6jE<br><br>In this video above, it looks like it&#039;s footage of something that has been publicly aired on TV or in some sort of video. Notice that there&#039;s a jump in the first few seconds of the explosion. This is important. Whoever published\\aired this video has deliberately cut the very first second or so, the initiation of the explosion from the footage. In this way the footage looks much more convincing as some sort of super scary &#039;super weapon&#039;.<br><br>However other footage of the same detonation exists elsewhere. Here&#039;s another video: https://youtu.be/YUd7tgIirBI<br><br>Now if you watch this video, you can clearly see that the initiation of the explosion starts ABOVE WATER, on the barge itself, as if the barge has been packed with explosives. But they claim that what we&#039;re watching here is a nuke detonating UNDERWATER. You clearly see a bright flash of explosion, so bright that there&#039;s a reflective flash on the clouds above. You don&#039;t see any &#039;flash&#039; below water, just an explosion that seems to be directed upwards from the barge, as if they were trying to draw water into the air with the explosion.<br><br>No matter how many times I watch this, I can&#039;t unsee that the explosion takes place either entirely or almost entirely ABOVE WATER.<br><br>If a nuclear bomb detonated below water, in theory the initial reaction should be so intense and hot that it should literally BOIL water.

TV Shows and movies made by Neocons started popping up in Netflix - House or Cards, Mad Men, Hell or High Water and such. These are men like Elon Musk who became a Chad when he was a faggot Paypal Nerd to begin with. Guys like Elon tried their best to resist the gay nigger faggot psyop. And he succeded, he reversed his balding, he got rich as fuck, and he started banging bitches and think about going to space. Of course, in the midst of getting rich as hell one does come across the jew, and they are one of those things he needs to &quot;watch out&quot; for. The jews need internal struggle in order to divide and conquer. So they place both sides of the fence. They&#039;ll install Trump for 4 years and then directly flip the coin on the other side just to give the right wingers a brief taste of freedom, and make them miss it so dearly that they would destroy anything in their path to get some more, like a dog trained in pavlovian response.

If there was a Jewish state next to Ancient Rome, and a Roman was killed in the Jewish state and the Romans demanded the Jews hand over the Jewish suspect to be judged in Roman court, the Talmud says they shouldn&#039;t hand them over, because it happened in Jewish territory and most likely the Jew won&#039;t get a fair trial, because a fellow idolator was killed. This isn&#039;t really that different from countries with non-extradition treaties refusing to hand over their citizen to be judged in Russia or wherever. Since it&#039;s a Sanhedrin verse, there is no Sanhedrin court apart from in Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods in modern times, Jews are still under secular law everywhere (including Israel) so they would have to hand them over anyway.
