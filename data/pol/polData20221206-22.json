It contradicts the Bible, which says man only dies once and then the judgement. I know your way sounds like a wild ride, but luckily that&#039;s not true. <br><br>To prove that the Bible is supernaturally authored, I wrote a 430 page book with 785 sources that irrefutably and conclusively proves that 9/11 was an inside job, the Bible is supernaturally authored, and the jews of today are not the Biblical Israelites, white people are. <br><br>Given that Biblical prophecy places us currently in the end times, this is all conducted by the Synagogue of Satan, prophesied to exist in Revelation. This cabal acts as an international criminal syndicate, loosely based around freemasonry and luciferianism. They facilitated 9/11 as a complex money operation, in order to conceal a massive amount of real-wealth that was looted from the world through planned and intentionally created World Wars, and used in the form of fraudulent security bonds to collapse the USSR. I prove that Lusitania and Pearl Harbor were conspiracies and false flags similar to 9/11. <br><br>The Bible was supernaturally authored, and I prove it through several ways, such as historically fulfilled prophecy, Equidistant Letter Spacing codes placed within the text, and knowledge present that is thousands of years ahead of its time, only possible through divine intervention. <br><br>Pdf can be downloaded here: <br><br>https://www.docdroid.net/R6I5wtJ/th<wbr>e-more-rational-worldview-pdf <br><br>- NEW - <br><br>Now available as an audiobook: <br><br>https://www.bitchute.com/video/t9j9<wbr>sAQxeBf3/ <br><br>Check out my sequel: <br><br>https://www.docdroid.net/KgC58z3/sc<wbr>ientism-the-one-world-religion-youv<wbr>e-been-waiting-for-pdf", "time": 1670384469, "resto": 407360343, "id": "ASFE3La6", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 407381468, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:41:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407379191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407379191</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Jew</span>", "time": 1670384485, "resto": 407360343, "id": "pdf1w9n0", "country": "GB", "country_name": "United Kingdom"}], "last_modified": 1670384485}, {"no": 407380641, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:34:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Oh no, conservative cuck bros, they&#039;re bullying us now", "filename": "8tk3henzy94a1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 826, "h": 1055, "tn_w": 195, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670384052064815, "time": 1670384052, "md5": "gesDKTmBhkTUuAyn8dNSxA==", "fsize": 76648, "resto": 0, "id": "OgFNYoAt", "country": "IN", "m_img": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "oh-no-conservative-cuck-bros-theyre-bullying-us", "country_name": "India", "replies": 10, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 407381185, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:38:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407380878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407380878</a><br>It&#039;s probably fake, but if I were a grandpa assembling a puzzle, I&#039;d start with the face (eyes/nouse/mouth) and work my way outwards.

You can&#039;t, because there isn&#039;t any and never will be due to certain races trapped in what scientists call &quot;evolutionary dead ends&quot;. Simply moving large groups of people from one geographic region to the next will not make their IQ increase by 15 points, nor will their childrens IQ reflect an increase. It&#039;s the whole proverbial water down the races and regression towards the mean concept. I suspect once whites go extinct in the west, much of the world will enter another another dark age due to collapse of society and the welfare state.", "filename": "1669775018649679", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 718, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670383115652167, "time": 1670383115, "md5": "kPIrcL71wyK2sU/3jO2z5Q==", "fsize": 103970, "resto": 0, "id": "mztBb8mb", "board_flag": "PR", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "diversity-and-the-coming-race-war", "flag_name": "Pirate", "replies": 8, "images": 5, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 407379231, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407378863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407378863</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;coming </span><br><br><br>It\u2019s here", "filename": "DE7AFDCD-B3AC-4726-AAE3-5CDD50E76AED", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 728, "h": 1021, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670383316274218, "time": 1670383316, "md5": "hYvDUkPGGIwDMje6kj9IdA==", "fsize": 226902, "resto": 407378863, "id": "NYLE0WCW", "country": "US", "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 407379247, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407378863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407378863</a>", "filename": "NatJewo", "ext": ".png", "w": 2063, "h": 3000, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670383325109481, "time": 1670383325, "md5": "lP327loAC0ZK2+RIw4GRjA==", "fsize": 771860, "resto": 407378863, "id": "YbUeuIQn", "country": "US", "m_img": 1, "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 407379415, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:23:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407378863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407378863</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beautiful </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Race War</span><br>Why even bother when you reach that point", "filename": "Kek 2", "ext": ".gif", "w": 160, "h": 160, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670383408432035, "time": 1670383408, "md5": "cgEnMpS/Ht1fpZitostkiQ==", "fsize": 688939, "resto": 407378863, "id": "bALSNhcq", "country": "NZ", "country_name": "New Zealand"}, {"no": 407379650, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:25:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p407378863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;407378863</a><br><br>Whites are pathetic and weak.

When the students come in, I will jump out of the closet and give an impassioned speech extolling the virtues of true communism and formal education. I will somdomize myself with my Beretta and then I will pull the trigger, turning my innards into pudding and hopefully opening a new fuckhole on the top of my skull.
