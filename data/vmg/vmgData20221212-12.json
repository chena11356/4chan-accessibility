Bots that are faster, more reactive, flexible and insta-kill and are just able and &quot;Better&quot; than all players. Be prepared to to be sniped and headshot&#039;d at very long distances by a &quot;player&quot; with an SMG. Hell, even players who run around melee knifing turn out to be bots sometimes given their unrealistically fast and quick reaction timing. Please do not dare tell me these are just &quot;good skilled&quot; players who use that three-fingered claw grab technique because there is just so much Adderall those sweaty gamer can chug without dying from drug overdose. And to segue to rant about ranked matches, I wish more people can just simply and humbly acknowledge that certain &quot;players&quot; you go up against in ranked matches are literal bots. So the guy who was originally complaining about sweaty gamers and so called &quot;potential cheaters&quot; is not completely wrong.<br><br>The only think he&#039;s wrong about is being unfairly paired against players with physical controller support. But the unbelievably &quot;good and skilled&quot; players in ranked matches are actually bots and I am guessing the reason why there are these Terminator Skynet bots in ranked matches and most likely in upcoming Warzone mobile. Is due to more pragmatic reasons, I guess there these bots in competitive multiplayer games is for the sake of filling up server numbers and providing some form of difficulty for the legit real players out there. But its double edge sword, one hand the reason for these bots running around is to fill up server number quotas and provide difficulty or &quot;challenge&quot;. But said difficulty and challenge from these bots is or can be insultingly artificial. I guess just deal with it and put up with meta, broken perks and mechanics and the bots in ranked matches. Though I guess the reason why you do sometimes end up loosing in ranked matches because your team mates are actually the dumbass stupid bots.

I had people literally telling me that money is not tied to gameplay in any way even though CARDS in this CARD GAME are locked behind a season pass paywall. Hell, it&#039;s even WORSE than free to play games I used to try to play because not only do you have to pay $10 for gameplay content, you ALSO have to do a daily grind to make sure you actually get the things that $10 entitles you to. Free to play games always used to be EITHER grinding OR paying, but this is a PAID GRIND.
