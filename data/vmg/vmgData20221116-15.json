There are 15 townhalls atm, you start at TH2. To upgrade to the next townhall the only requirement is to place all the buildings on your current townhall. Even if those buildings are all lvl1, if you have enough loot, you are free to upgrade. Essentially what I&#039;m saying is that you can play at your own pace and stil have access to whatever newest feature was added with the latest townhall. <br>A F2P player has essentially two ways to max:<br>1)For new players the usual advice is to max everything at their current townhall before upgrading because this way they get enough time to learn everyting. The main problem is the time that it will take you to accomplish this. This is not impossible, it all depends on how much you will stick with the game, how much time you can play etc. With each new townhall all the previous get cost and time reductions for upgrades, in fact you will get through low townhalls extremely fast, and trust me when I say that I was not like that before. The main issue are high townhalls to the point when upgrade time just doesn&#039;t make sense (we are talking 15+ days here).<br>2)Rushing. I won&#039;t go in details here because it requires a long explanation of the main idea that people usually ignore (and literally nobody will ever read it). I will just say that you focus on your offense and planning upgrades in a certain way, don&#039;t just rush in a dumb way. People usually don&#039;t even consider going this route and there&#039;s a debate to this day whether this an altenative or not.

If her S1 works like the panel-based boosts then you may even be able to stack them together on one unit. Plus her passive can give over 5k ATK to herself if you&#039;re good at keeping those LV3 skill panels going. Seems like one of the devs loves physical Fire types, seeing how many good units there are now.<br><br>Gareth is definitely a bit weaker but her buffs/debuffs are essentially permanent and pretty strong. Her passive and crash both essentially guarantee that her S2 buff (which itself has 100% uptime and is pretty hefty) will proc.

As in if you have 4 times atk vs def instead of 2 times, you deal double damage. So to get the same effect with atk buffs that you&#039;d get with def debuffs, you&#039;d need a LOT more atk buffs.<br><br>I dunno exact formulas, but it&#039;s pretty obvious that def debuffs get really fucking broken once you reach a certain threshold, likewise if you go up against relatively weak enemies, you don&#039;t even need that. <br>Last score attack I fucked up once and used wolf girls skills the wrong order, so only 3 tiles were absorbed instead of 5. She still had the 30% amp world fragment, and obviously her crash def down, so the difference is like -4000 vs. -5400 ish def down. Like that I didn&#039;t even deal half the damage, and instead of a comfy 2 turn experience with tons of overkill, I needed either 4 full turns or maybe even 5.<br><br>So yeah, ATK isn&#039;t unimportant, but a 10k buff does literally nothing if you can&#039;t massively shred defense. We always had Musashi for extreme crash damage multiplier and atk buffs (~8k) and the fire loli for insane amounts of slayers, but while they definitely deal more damage, it&#039;s not nearly having as much impact as massive def down. I think before atk buffs would compared, they&#039;d need to be like 30k-40k. I kinda hope they actually change the def bullshit. After all it&#039;s going both ways.

There&#039;s a method of doing them you gotta learn though in order to not have a full inventory 100% of the time while still doing all hexes that drop all the good stuff like material shells and 3 star kit shells. Most basic rule is to do all the blue hexes first, sell all the trash shells you get from them, and then do the red, yellow, and 3 area blue hexes(some 2 area hexes also drop good stuff so I remember them.) Once you get the hang of doing this, you won&#039;t miss any of the important shells that drop from those hexes due to a full inventory. Your battery stock will increase quicker than you are using them too. One thing to note is I also discard any S gear shells too since I have no use for them other than the medals you get from selling personal gear but I find that gear medal shells are more efficient. However, if I know I&#039;m going to end my run soon I leave S gear shells in my inventory and analyze them last before I close the game. <br>Another thing to mention is farming for quality blue gear to +99 your gear. For this I analyze any regular 2 star blue gear shells I get, as it is more efficient then analyzing regular 3 star blue gear shells. Also I check the map completion rewards for the glowing blue gear shells that are guaranteed to give quality blue gear. You may get an upward of 4 of these shells sometimes from fully completing maps. Usually I pay gold (you&#039;ll have plenty of gold if you are farming hexes constantly and I almost never run out unless I upgrade gear) to skip maps until I&#039;m on a map that gives them as a reward for map completion, but I don&#039;t skip the purple background maps that give more scout points than normal maps do. <br>I&#039;m not sure I mentioned everything but this is a gist of what I do.", "time": 1668092129, "resto": 848546}], "last_modified": 1668092129}, {"no": 1040734, "now": "11/03/22(Thu)15:44:09", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Android piracy", "com": "Is this a thing?
