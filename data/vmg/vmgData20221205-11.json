The second scale is used for above border stats and reduces the minimum damage even further as you approach the Effect Parameter Cap. Most of the time for harder enemies, the Effect Parameter Cap is so large that it&#039;s unfeasible for current teams to reach it and reduce damage to 1, which would be why you have the impression that stats above the border don&#039;t do anything, even though it absolutely does.", "time": 1670154189, "resto": 1047728}, {"no": 1064217, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)11:14:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1064128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064128</a><br><a href=\"#p1064136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064136</a><br>Could be.
