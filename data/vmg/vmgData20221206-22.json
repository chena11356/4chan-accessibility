But the unbelievably &quot;good and skilled&quot; players in ranked matches are actually bots and I am guessing the reason why there are these Terminator Skynet bots in ranked matches and most likely in upcoming Warzone mobile. Is due to more pragmatic reasons, I guess there these bots in competitive multiplayer games is for the sake of filling up server numbers and providing some form of difficulty for the legit real players out there. But its double edge sword, one hand the reason for these bots running around is to fill up server number quotas and provide difficulty or &quot;challenge&quot;. But said difficulty and challenge from these bots is or can be insultingly artificial. I guess just deal with it and put up with meta, broken perks and mechanics and the bots in ranked matches. Though I guess the reason why you do sometimes end up loosing in ranked matches because your team mates are actually the dumbass stupid bots.

The second scale is used for above border stats and reduces the minimum damage even further as you approach the Effect Parameter Cap. Most of the time for harder enemies, the Effect Parameter Cap is so large that it&#039;s unfeasible for current teams to reach it and reduce damage to 1, which would be why you have the impression that stats above the border don&#039;t do anything, even though it absolutely does.", "time": 1670154189, "resto": 1047728}, {"no": 1064217, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)11:14:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1064128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064128</a><br><a href=\"#p1064136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064136</a><br>Could be.
