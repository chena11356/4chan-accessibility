As much as your PC can handle (mine could only do 4). Otherwise, a tip is that you only need to really play the first few stages.

Even the final boss you can be completely AFK for and they&#039;ll always win. <br><br>Notable ones I remember where its partially manual are the very beginning of the sniper stage, it won&#039;t progress until you manually kill a few in the distance.

There are almost 2,500,000 million free gems in the permanent content, and it takes 150,000 to full pity a character&#039;s entire kit, but if you do that then the odds are incredibly in your favor that you will also have acquired 2 other character&#039;s entire kits as well. There are also easily over 10,000 tickets, which are basically the same as gems, but with gems you are building pity. Also, if you 10 pull, you get a bonus +1 that has increased rates, so gems are definitely better, but those 10,000 tickets lasted me for over 6 months, and I was pulling on everything with them, like literally every single banner I was spending hundreds of tickets, and for 2 different banners I spent 1,000 because impulse. Now that I only have 300 tickets left, I have 1,700,000 gems still. This new difficulty has shit all over my luck, and if I want something I have usually had to full pity it, but by now I have like 70% of the cast&#039;s entire kit, minus their &quot;burst&quot; which is the rarest thing. There&#039;s also like 400 tickets and 75,000 gems per month if you complete the content as it releases. Something like that<br><br>It used to be insanely f2p, and it&#039;s still f2p, but now they jew you with Enhancement Points.

If you pay 5$/month for the basic mogpass, then you are showered with so many Enhancement Points that you can completely forget they even exist, but the other stuff is still somewhat limited. EX books are kinda limited too, but there are like 75 of those in the permanent content or something like that, and there&#039;s only ~150 characters so it&#039;s not too bad. Just only max characters you like and/or are using and you&#039;ll be fine<br><br>A lot of people dont&#039; like this new difficulty though.

There&#039;s a method of doing them you gotta learn though in order to not have a full inventory 100% of the time while still doing all hexes that drop all the good stuff like material shells and 3 star kit shells. Most basic rule is to do all the blue hexes first, sell all the trash shells you get from them, and then do the red, yellow, and 3 area blue hexes(some 2 area hexes also drop good stuff so I remember them.) Once you get the hang of doing this, you won&#039;t miss any of the important shells that drop from those hexes due to a full inventory. Your battery stock will increase quicker than you are using them too. One thing to note is I also discard any S gear shells too since I have no use for them other than the medals you get from selling personal gear but I find that gear medal shells are more efficient. However, if I know I&#039;m going to end my run soon I leave S gear shells in my inventory and analyze them last before I close the game. <br>Another thing to mention is farming for quality blue gear to +99 your gear. For this I analyze any regular 2 star blue gear shells I get, as it is more efficient then analyzing regular 3 star blue gear shells. Also I check the map completion rewards for the glowing blue gear shells that are guaranteed to give quality blue gear. You may get an upward of 4 of these shells sometimes from fully completing maps.

There are 15 townhalls atm, you start at TH2. To upgrade to the next townhall the only requirement is to place all the buildings on your current townhall. Even if those buildings are all lvl1, if you have enough loot, you are free to upgrade. Essentially what I&#039;m saying is that you can play at your own pace and stil have access to whatever newest feature was added with the latest townhall. <br>A F2P player has essentially two ways to max:<br>1)For new players the usual advice is to max everything at their current townhall before upgrading because this way they get enough time to learn everyting. The main problem is the time that it will take you to accomplish this. This is not impossible, it all depends on how much you will stick with the game, how much time you can play etc. With each new townhall all the previous get cost and time reductions for upgrades, in fact you will get through low townhalls extremely fast, and trust me when I say that I was not like that before. The main issue are high townhalls to the point when upgrade time just doesn&#039;t make sense (we are talking 15+ days here).<br>2)Rushing. I won&#039;t go in details here because it requires a long explanation of the main idea that people usually ignore (and literally nobody will ever read it). I will just say that you focus on your offense and planning upgrades in a certain way, don&#039;t just rush in a dumb way. People usually don&#039;t even consider going this route and there&#039;s a debate to this day whether this an altenative or not. I think it is and allows to max faster and save a lot of time you would just waste otherwise, but if done incorrectly it will become a very unpleasant experience very fast and it will suck to recover.<br><a href=\"#p1049709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049709</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or will you never get banned as long as you don&#039;t let anyone know you&#039;re on an emulator?</span><br>This", "time": 1668536007, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049731, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:21:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1049724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049724</a><br>Which emulator do you use?", "time": 1668536515, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049757, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:54:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;install latest version of nox</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;install clash of clans and boom beach</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;clash of clans works, boom beach doesn&#039;t</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;both are supercell games</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;google doesn&#039;t have an answer</span><br>How the fuck do I fix this?", "filename": "1664812965263153", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1668538497519397, "time": 1668538497, "md5": "wpvl8im03qHPnQ2xGNMHDQ==", "fsize": 45058, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049760, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:58:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1049731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049731</a><br>I don&#039;t personally use them, but I know those who do and they use bluestacks, aren&#039;t emulators all kinda the same after all?<br>On a side note, can you emulate and use bots too?
