I won&#039;t miss the Hall of Fame, will I?<br><br>Blogposting now:<br>I found out the Methodical contract is great for soulstone farming. I wish I had event points to buy another one, so I&#039;d fill it with Skill Boost +20% and one Proficiency piece and wouldn&#039;t regret shit. I need to start doing Hunt dungeons (for things like Skill Boost +30%).<br><br>Methodical (2x Mining) + Skill Boost and Proficiency (3x) + Many Arms (2x) = 12 times<br>times 5 for the highest level dungeons plus other less relevant bonus (so 6 or 7) - so 60~84<br>times whatever the base mining value is (35? so around 3k per click?)<br><br>With Lunatic we have more time saved, as it can be set so only Mining is used (without Ninjutsu and its following Blood Armor, so more free slots), and I suppose a full turn would take (at minimum) around 10 seconds. So 1 million soulstones per hour?? This is going to be my next goal.<br><br>I also found out now, late in the game, I could be using the protection (star) feature to sort out new lab and contract parts. So buying many contracts at once and cleaning the mess of repeated crap wouldn&#039;t be a huge pain in the ass.<br><br>I also successfully isolated an HP/Lv and HP Boost contract pieces into spare Inferno (non-mergeable effect) ones. It works as I guessed it would. And bought everything I thought I could use in the future with dark studies. The only thing I missed was buying another Methodical piece.

There are 15 townhalls atm, you start at TH2. To upgrade to the next townhall the only requirement is to place all the buildings on your current townhall. Even if those buildings are all lvl1, if you have enough loot, you are free to upgrade. Essentially what I&#039;m saying is that you can play at your own pace and stil have access to whatever newest feature was added with the latest townhall. <br>A F2P player has essentially two ways to max:<br>1)For new players the usual advice is to max everything at their current townhall before upgrading because this way they get enough time to learn everyting. The main problem is the time that it will take you to accomplish this. This is not impossible, it all depends on how much you will stick with the game, how much time you can play etc. With each new townhall all the previous get cost and time reductions for upgrades, in fact you will get through low townhalls extremely fast, and trust me when I say that I was not like that before. The main issue are high townhalls to the point when upgrade time just doesn&#039;t make sense (we are talking 15+ days here).<br>2)Rushing. I won&#039;t go in details here because it requires a long explanation of the main idea that people usually ignore (and literally nobody will ever read it). I will just say that you focus on your offense and planning upgrades in a certain way, don&#039;t just rush in a dumb way. People usually don&#039;t even consider going this route and there&#039;s a debate to this day whether this an altenative or not. I think it is and allows to max faster and save a lot of time you would just waste otherwise, but if done incorrectly it will become a very unpleasant experience very fast and it will suck to recover.<br><a href=\"#p1049709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049709</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or will you never get banned as long as you don&#039;t let anyone know you&#039;re on an emulator?</span><br>This", "time": 1668536007, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049731, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:21:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1049724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049724</a><br>Which emulator do you use?", "time": 1668536515, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049757, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:54:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;install latest version of nox</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;install clash of clans and boom beach</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;clash of clans works, boom beach doesn&#039;t</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;both are supercell games</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;google doesn&#039;t have an answer</span><br>How the fuck do I fix this?", "filename": "1664812965263153", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1668538497519397, "time": 1668538497, "md5": "wpvl8im03qHPnQ2xGNMHDQ==", "fsize": 45058, "resto": 1008311}, {"no": 1049760, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:58:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1049731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1049731</a><br>I don&#039;t personally use them, but I know those who do and they use bluestacks, aren&#039;t emulators all kinda the same after all?<br>On a side note, can you emulate and use bots too?

Most basic rule is to do all the blue hexes first, sell all the trash shells you get from them, and then do the red, yellow, and 3 area blue hexes(some 2 area hexes also drop good stuff so I remember them.) Once you get the hang of doing this, you won&#039;t miss any of the important shells that drop from those hexes due to a full inventory. Your battery stock will increase quicker than you are using them too. One thing to note is I also discard any S gear shells too since I have no use for them other than the medals you get from selling personal gear but I find that gear medal shells are more efficient. However, if I know I&#039;m going to end my run soon I leave S gear shells in my inventory and analyze them last before I close the game. <br>Another thing to mention is farming for quality blue gear to +99 your gear. For this I analyze any regular 2 star blue gear shells I get, as it is more efficient then analyzing regular 3 star blue gear shells. Also I check the map completion rewards for the glowing blue gear shells that are guaranteed to give quality blue gear. You may get an upward of 4 of these shells sometimes from fully completing maps. Usually I pay gold (you&#039;ll have plenty of gold if you are farming hexes constantly and I almost never run out unless I upgrade gear) to skip maps until I&#039;m on a map that gives them as a reward for map completion, but I don&#039;t skip the purple background maps that give more scout points than normal maps do. <br>I&#039;m not sure I mentioned everything but this is a gist of what I do.", "time": 1668092129, "resto": 848546}], "last_modified": 1668092129}, {"no": 1036232, "now": "10/29/22(Sat)19:56:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Fire Emblem Heroes", "com": "Did you summon for Rearmed Grima or anyone else on her banner? <br>What Arcane weapon would you like to see next, and which unit would you give it to?", "filename": "1665988310994661", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3606, "h": 2183, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 151, "tim": 1667087763692278, "time": 1667087763, "md5": "cwR8aNMsUcDlhM+6H1YpnA==", "fsize": 3210251, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fire-emblem-heroes", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 670, "images": 144, "omitted_posts": 665, "omitted_images": 142, "last_replies": [{"no": 1051294, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)12:10:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1051275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1051275</a><br>Shez will be the second insta demote to appears on a banner", "time": 1668705052, "resto": 1036232}, {"no": 1051303, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)12:35:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1051140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1051140</a><br>I&#039;d say I dislike 3H banners the least in terms of the units they choose for these banners even if they have their weird duds (Ferdinand...).

On a side note I think 3H spam is a bit exaggerated, maybe it&#039;s a new player thing because I feel like early game Fates still outwins them in the unit spam.
