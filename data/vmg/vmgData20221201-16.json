If you play for a while you get your S upgrades eventually, but new people are.. new. <br><br>This change will do 2 very important things:<br>-SS without an S do no longer have massive disadvantages (think Miko, Mari or even some that only have a relatively recent S like Higuchi)<br>-SS lb1 is no longer weaker than ss lb0 but max lb S. <br>-SS lb2 also has more value as it bumps the level cap higher than what you can do with S<br><br>I&#039;m not sure if they massively bump the stat requirement. Yes, everything gets stronger to an extend, but I feel like a lot of it had to get stronger to deal with the 340 we have now. Easy example Yunyun. She dies turn 2 against hailhorses if they focus her, and there&#039;s literally nothing you can do about this. 10 levels will help.<br><br>This was a necessary change going forward. It&#039;s a really shitty situation to get a new SS and it&#039;s unusable because the level cap is garbage and you are only happy about those that have an event S. Now every SS basically has a former event S, and those with an event S still have a bit of an edge, just not as big anymore.
