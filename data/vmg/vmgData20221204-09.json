The second scale is used for above border stats and reduces the minimum damage even further as you approach the Effect Parameter Cap. Most of the time for harder enemies, the Effect Parameter Cap is so large that it&#039;s unfeasible for current teams to reach it and reduce damage to 1, which would be why you have the impression that stats above the border don&#039;t do anything, even though it absolutely does.", "time": 1670154189, "resto": 1047728}], "last_modified": 1670154189}, {"no": 1058200, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)23:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "D4DJ Groovy Mix", "com": "Hayate is truly the biggest dork in DJs.<br>HayaKoko cards doko?", "filename": "FifqQ0yUoAARbEP", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1300, "h": 1300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669609887851460, "time": 1669609887, "md5": "4SUYsoui0cs00MzIcAbreQ==", "fsize": 75649, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "d4dj-groovy-mix", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 144, "images": 38, "omitted_posts": 139, "omitted_images": 38, "last_replies": [{"no": 1064089, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)04:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1063962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1063962</a><br>Who has the key to Nagi&#039;s slave collar?", "time": 1670145727, "resto": 1058200}, {"no": 1064126, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:21:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So when are we actually getting the new units", "time": 1670152890, "resto": 1058200}, {"no": 1064130, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:31:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1064126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064126</a><br>2.5 Anniversary", "time": 1670153472, "resto": 1058200}, {"no": 1064133, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:40:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1064126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064126</a><br><a href=\"#p1064130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064130</a><br>May 2023", "time": 1670154012, "resto": 1058200}, {"no": 1064164, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:37:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1064006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1064006</a><br>It&#039;s not that hard IMO if you don&#039;t care about getting stat updates", "time": 1670161038, "resto": 1058200}], "last_modified": 1670161038}, {"no": 1021886, "now": "10/16/22(Sun)15:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Legend Clover", "com": "or Legeclo for short", "filename": "13448645121", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1680, "h": 950, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 141, "tim": 1665950071279440, "time": 1665950071, "md5": "Mylx4wCLzlv9exCnmi0rcg==", "fsize": 262978, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "legend-clover", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 58, "images": 9, "omitted_posts": 53, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 1057652, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)06:02:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1035350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1035350</a><br><a href=\"#p1056346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1056346</a><br>Use Google Lens or something similar and MTL?", "time": 1669546930, "resto": 1021886}, {"no": 1063744, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)12:45:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it even worth using master quest mats on supporters?", "time": 1670089551, "resto": 1021886}, {"no": 1063772, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)14:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1063744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1063744</a><br>Absolutely.
