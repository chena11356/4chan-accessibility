Hell, even players who run around melee knifing turn out to be bots sometimes given their unrealistically fast and quick reaction timing.

But the unbelievably &quot;good and skilled&quot; players in ranked matches are actually bots and I am guessing the reason why there are these Terminator Skynet bots in ranked matches and most likely in upcoming Warzone mobile. Is due to more pragmatic reasons, I guess there these bots in competitive multiplayer games is for the sake of filling up server numbers and providing some form of difficulty for the legit real players out there. But its double edge sword, one hand the reason for these bots running around is to fill up server number quotas and provide difficulty or &quot;challenge&quot;. But said difficulty and challenge from these bots is or can be insultingly artificial. I guess just deal with it and put up with meta, broken perks and mechanics and the bots in ranked matches. Though I guess the reason why you do sometimes end up loosing in ranked matches because your team mates are actually the dumbass stupid bots.
