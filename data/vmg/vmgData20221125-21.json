Saying you should get at least one Shaman and their S+ tiers are accurate enough being the best/most versatile DPS. S and below is where things start to get debatable, but for reroll tier lists you simply aim for the toppest tier which I would agree are S. Teruru, Rakion, Waemawa, and maybe Muzzle who&#039;s quite versatile, but isn&#039;t quite as overwhelming as the others. Though she&#039;s definitely up there. <br><br>I still don&#039;t understand the obsession Nips have with rating Neil so highly. While she definitely has her uses, her DPS and general output isn&#039;t very good with a 10/30 skill cycle and very low base attack. She solves a few problems, but I wouldn&#039;t say it puts her in S tier, especially for a reroll target where you&#039;d want stuff that is generally powerful. Okyu is also a bit strange, but it seems they&#039;re valuing the ability to farm Limit Break. Besides that I&#039;d bump Rafuka down and normal Atheel up. Rafuka&#039;s range really holds her back and Lauren is substantially more usable due to having range boost on skill. Atheel&#039;s redeploy reduction is just always useful and her burn aura is completely unresisted and can answer a bunch of things despite her main job being healing.

This is a double edged sword in that with less effort to acquire and build characters, there\u2019s not much motivation than to do the bare minimum if even that whereas in Dokkan once you\u2019ve committed to maxing out your LR Gohan it\u2019s going to take a few days at the least and then once it\u2019s done you move on to the next character; even though in both cases you\u2019re intended to login every day it\u2019s easy to see why Legends is seen as more of a chore than it\u2019s counterpart. I feel that this approach is better for this kind of game even if you have the occasional retard completely dumbfounded why they have no crystals when only log in occasionally to do all the content in one sitting.<br><br>I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201ccomplete all these missions to get the 1k crystals\u201d approach they\u2019ve been doing but they\u2019re trivially easy since there purpose is to get you to log in every day, same with the log in bonuses and free summons and daily mission pass. Doing what you\u2019re supposed to in this case doesn\u2019t make you a salaryman drone anymore than the guy working on his Dokkan collection (probably less since the latter takes a lot more time), but if you\u2019re someone who actively hates the game and yet still plays you\u2019re more of a chink slave than anyone.", "filename": "8791BE52-FE0A-4497-A76A-19EB23D5254C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 812, "h": 609, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1669378788449157, "time": 1669378788, "md5": "zOMjHt+SXb53TH79LE/tVw==", "fsize": 114215, "resto": 900795}, {"no": 1056637, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)08:16:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1056299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1056299</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It gives you adventure and co-op skip tickets, that\u2019s probably the most time sensitive thing in this game for people that only log in.</span><br>you cannot exchange the old z medals for them so its complete garbage", "time": 1669382203, "resto": 900795}], "last_modified": 1669382203}, {"no": 1044290, "now": "11/07/22(Mon)06:12:40", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Space Leaper: Cocoon", "com": "waiting for snake?", "filename": "101582360_p0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1667819560794117, "time": 1667819560, "md5": "tvgoHFCiu2YOWENxHadbcw==", "fsize": 984655, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "space-leaper-cocoon", "custom_spoiler": 3, "replies": 146, "images": 28, "omitted_posts": 141, "omitted_images": 26, "last_replies": [{"no": 1056043, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)10:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;got three defense losses overnight</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what the fuck happened</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two were just coincidence but the first was literally not even my team</span><br>how", "filename": "Screenshot_20221124-072108_Space Leaper Cocoon", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 2280, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669303353449396, "time": 1669303353, "md5": "ApVdp2DTMYpLbBVSKGBd2Q==", "fsize": 2384516, "resto": 1044290}, {"no": 1056081, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)11:25:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1056036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1056036</a><br>How do you cheese with Latika?
