Without either Seira or Kozue, or the SP- strategy with TONS of firepower, you will take a much longer time. I think Seira doing prisms a little better (with a lot of help) is just fair, when Kozue is actually not entirely trash in dungeons, and in fact pretty good for your SP upkeep.

This is why everything crit is so awesome -&gt; It makes things die a lot faster. SP recovery is the same. Sure it doesn&#039;t do anything if you have nothing else, but that&#039;s the same with literally anything. <br>Calling that trash is just completely wrong. That&#039;s like calling batteries in counterside trash, TP boost in pricon trash and so on. Kozue is a battery, just like S Yunyun. That is VERY strong.<br><br>Sure, there are cases where she doesn&#039;t do anything for you, as there are always specific chars that are simply outstanding in a specific field. Being really good in a lot of fields (other than OD strategies, where for example Seira is also trash), is however still good. I think calling that bad is really really wrong.
