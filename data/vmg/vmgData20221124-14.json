Saying you should get at least one Shaman and their S+ tiers are accurate enough being the best/most versatile DPS. S and below is where things start to get debatable, but for reroll tier lists you simply aim for the toppest tier which I would agree are S.

Okyu is also a bit strange, but it seems they&#039;re valuing the ability to farm Limit Break. Besides that I&#039;d bump Rafuka down and normal Atheel up. Rafuka&#039;s range really holds her back and Lauren is substantially more usable due to having range boost on skill. Atheel&#039;s redeploy reduction is just always useful and her burn aura is completely unresisted and can answer a bunch of things despite her main job being healing.
