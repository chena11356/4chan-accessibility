But I&#039;ll entertain you. <br><br>First, I&#039;m a fucking software developer, so I do know a thing or two about programming an AI. Also work on a company that deals with this kind of shit, although on a different field, not in generating some random &#039;artwork&#039; - But deep down it&#039;s all the same.<br><br>How the fuck can you say &quot;no images - no AI&quot;. Firstly, educate your fucking self. What we call &quot;AI&quot; nowadays, is just a buzzword for what is actually machine learning. A program where you train it with input to generate a desired output. You can have a motor and not have a car - The motor is the &quot;AI&quot;. You feed it fuel and it goes BRR, but without the fuel it&#039;s still a fucking motor. That&#039;s what the machine learning algorithm does - You write a program that given a number of inputs, spits out a &#039;prediction&#039; of what the output would look like. These Image generators work just in the same way, you feed it a prompt and it spits out an image. How that works is because it was trained on a model, like other machine learning algorithms - Feed it a data set, that associates each image with a text-based description, and the AI stores in it&#039;s memory that the word &quot;duck&quot; can look like the 3 million images of ducks it has stored. So when you tell it to give you an image of a duck, it looks at the &quot;knowledge&quot; of those images, and spits out a &quot;new&quot; duck image.<br><br>If I tell an AI do draw a duck, and it samples from 7000 different artists/photographers, should I credit them all on the final image? don&#039;t think so, and this is no different from you drawing a fucking duck. You&#039;ve seen ducks, you&#039;ve seen pictures and drawings of ducks, so you can probably draw a fucking duck.

That data just makes it work, but the algorithm is there. The training data is nothing without the AI either, so that motor/car example doesn&#039;t quite work.

Even with basic shit like photoshop neural filters. I spent years learning PS and even did a side gig restoring and colouring old photos. Photoshop does most of it with a single click now, and any 14 year old can do what took me years to achieve. Sucks to be me. In any case AI isn&#039;t going to stop just because of some copyrights grey area. I&#039;m making the argument that what an AI does is not much different from learning by yourself, during some years of studying light, composition, framing, anatomy, etc etc, condensed into a neatly packed &quot;training data&quot; package.

AI is just the next one in line, and sadly artists are the next to go, for the most part.<br><br>It&#039;s also a really fucking dangerous path if you ask me. I like AI, I like writing some shit and seeing a cool image pop out, but millions other people are doing the same right now. There&#039;s so many AI generated images right now that in a few years time, most of digital images will be AI generated, and that will just lead to a loop of training data, where AIs are being trained on AI generations - original pieces and criativity will be a niche thing, and maybe that&#039;s were artists can re-emerge?

I recommend watching Rob Ager&#039;s series on AI from his website. So AI will stay at its current fucked up state for a decade, maybe more. It won&#039;t be a radical shift. The other thing is that this does not at all really free art from the artist and give it to the autistic engineer. You, at the very least, need an artist to go in and fix all the obvious mistakes that AI art makes. Unless of course you &quot;see nothing wrong&quot; with it because you are an autistic stemcel creature that thinks art = formulaic marvel movie. All AI art can do is reproduce basic artistic memes from a database, it can&#039;t create anything new. It can&#039;t even do it perfectly. Like not even close to perfect.

A good mix between styles that feared the coming years and ones that eagerly awaited it. Forgot that they had urban styles in too, with skate culture and rap going strong. Also had those 70s throwbacks that were a lot more materialistic like the smileys, colorful swirls, the curves to the clothes, etc. <br>I can&#039;t really pinpoint a single look to the era, but it at least felt as if the era was unsure of itself, unsure of the future, and each aesthetic was a sort of answer to that.

history of design aesthetics and how it coalesces over time into what can be called recognizable stylistic categories, this entire discussion is pretty bizarre...<br>The idea that a roughly 1/2 decade of commercial design exists as some distinct and unique aesthetic that must be separated from what was happening five years before it is ludicrous. So is the idea that any visual reference to it a handful of years past some arbitrary cutoff point is nostalgia or retro...perhaps some people see it that way or are motivated by that when following those stylistic cues, but as you point out this style hasn&#039;t even gone away yet.<br>The whole thing points to the fact that like clothing and music, graphic design has become more and more fashion-ized as the means of creating and distributing it have become more accessible. As the practical considerations of old methods and networks becomes more relaxed, novelty for its own sake can become a primary goal. Notions of design/art that stands the test of time and/or timelessness as an aesthetic ideal are not just ignored, shallow trends that come and go are idealized and any organic history/connections outside that niche that overlaps is rejected as meaningless. To acknowledge that recent history/connection is to declare that something isn&#039;t &quot;fresh&quot;...yet as you point out, truly fresh ideas are rare; aping the trend accurately is the mark of excellence.<br>It&#039;s not going to kill good design or anything, any more than retarded &quot;high&quot; fashion like picrel is going to make sensible clothing go away just because hipsters act as if keeping track is Serious and Important.<br>Aping trends and fashion cycles isn&#039;t new, but the speed of the turnover has definitely accelerated in the digital age in almost all creative fields.

Step one is forgetting the logo and focusing on how to exploit the cultural niche the site represents. Anonymity and memetic repetition are primary themes; the chan format and other modes of discussion (actual convos, baiting/trolling, etc.) are secondary; the history of the board is the least important - it&#039;s not a salable brand and if you don&#039;t like it buy a pass. <a href=\"#p423598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;423598</a> is on the right track UX-wise by emphasizing post numbers but his UI is fucking garbage and should be almost all in-text without the bullshit. He should also make mockups with text that wraps or breaks instead of imaginary optimal scenarios. <a href=\"#p425339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;425339</a> despite being just a logo this at least thematically understands the piss-bucket functionality of the board.

Cool ideas and good arguments.<br>Personally I&#039;d probably reduce even further. At least for now / as an exercise. By my understanding often times logo design is about finding the most elegant way of describing - which can be achieved through simplicity (allthough that is not a necessity: think medieval emblems which are elegant but the opposite of simple). So one not only has to carefully decide how but also what to describe. <br>In this particular case &#039;badge&#039; might even be enough to ask of the logo?

You know what I mean? What do you guys think? Am I stretching things too far? It could also be interesting to introduce an image of people one desires to sell to.

Having illustration skills definitely can be a plus as a designer, but most designers don&#039;t do illustration. I know layout people who have never done any illustration in 20 years of work experience, like one I know who does book layout. Some designers specialize in image editing. Some specialize in business graphics, like charts and infographics. Graphic design is a vast field, designing everything from packaging design to page layout to ad design. Part of it is creative, part of it is technical, like knowing how to set up a template for packaging, like using Tetrapack templates, or setting up die layers for custom packaging. Or indexing a catalog. Or designing the layout of a website. You can work as a freelancer locally, or for a company, or for a marketing agency. I met a designer once at a Adobe conference who worked for a big health organization who just did the brochures they hand out in office, he managed a library of over 1000 pamphlets, updating them and getting their fulfillment house up to date and in stock. <br>My first steps into graphic design were working for Aquent, going into ad agencies to fill in for people on maternity leave or on vacation, and I spent my time doing edits and resizing ads for different publications.
