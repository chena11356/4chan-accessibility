I recommend watching Rob Ager&#039;s series on AI from his website. So AI will stay at its current fucked up state for a decade, maybe more. It won&#039;t be a radical shift. The other thing is that this does not at all really free art from the artist and give it to the autistic engineer. You, at the very least, need an artist to go in and fix all the obvious mistakes that AI art makes. Unless of course you &quot;see nothing wrong&quot; with it because you are an autistic stemcel creature that thinks art = formulaic marvel movie. All AI art can do is reproduce basic artistic memes from a database, it can&#039;t create anything new. It can&#039;t even do it perfectly. Like not even close to perfect.

history of design aesthetics and how it coalesces over time into what can be called recognizable stylistic categories, this entire discussion is pretty bizarre...<br>The idea that a roughly 1/2 decade of commercial design exists as some distinct and unique aesthetic that must be separated from what was happening five years before it is ludicrous. So is the idea that any visual reference to it a handful of years past some arbitrary cutoff point is nostalgia or retro...perhaps some people see it that way or are motivated by that when following those stylistic cues, but as you point out this style hasn&#039;t even gone away yet.<br>The whole thing points to the fact that like clothing and music, graphic design has become more and more fashion-ized as the means of creating and distributing it have become more accessible. As the practical considerations of old methods and networks becomes more relaxed, novelty for its own sake can become a primary goal. Notions of design/art that stands the test of time and/or timelessness as an aesthetic ideal are not just ignored, shallow trends that come and go are idealized and any organic history/connections outside that niche that overlaps is rejected as meaningless. To acknowledge that recent history/connection is to declare that something isn&#039;t &quot;fresh&quot;...yet as you point out, truly fresh ideas are rare; aping the trend accurately is the mark of excellence.<br>It&#039;s not going to kill good design or anything, any more than retarded &quot;high&quot; fashion like picrel is going to make sensible clothing go away just because hipsters act as if keeping track is Serious and Important.<br>Aping trends and fashion cycles isn&#039;t new, but the speed of the turnover has definitely accelerated in the digital age in almost all creative fields.

Also work on a company that deals with this kind of shit, although on a different field, not in generating some random &#039;artwork&#039; - But deep down it&#039;s all the same.<br><br>How the fuck can you say &quot;no images - no AI&quot;. Firstly, educate your fucking self. What we call &quot;AI&quot; nowadays, is just a buzzword for what is actually machine learning. A program where you train it with input to generate a desired output. You can have a motor and not have a car - The motor is the &quot;AI&quot;. You feed it fuel and it goes BRR, but without the fuel it&#039;s still a fucking motor. That&#039;s what the machine learning algorithm does - You write a program that given a number of inputs, spits out a &#039;prediction&#039; of what the output would look like. These Image generators work just in the same way, you feed it a prompt and it spits out an image. How that works is because it was trained on a model, like other machine learning algorithms - Feed it a data set, that associates each image with a text-based description, and the AI stores in it&#039;s memory that the word &quot;duck&quot; can look like the 3 million images of ducks it has stored. So when you tell it to give you an image of a duck, it looks at the &quot;knowledge&quot; of those images, and spits out a &quot;new&quot; duck image.<br><br>If I tell an AI do draw a duck, and it samples from 7000 different artists/photographers, should I credit them all on the final image? don&#039;t think so, and this is no different from you drawing a fucking duck. You&#039;ve seen ducks, you&#039;ve seen pictures and drawings of ducks, so you can probably draw a fucking duck.

You can have a car without a motor and still look at it and &quot;yep, that&#039;s a car, it just doesn&#039;t go very far&quot;.<br><br>As for the AI using everyone&#039;s knowledge to produce images, that&#039;s just the way it is. It sucks for artists that worked hard on developing those skills, and I can sympathise as I was a graphic designer before switching to software dev ( better pay and design clients fucking suck ). Even with basic shit like photoshop neural filters. I spent years learning PS and even did a side gig restoring and colouring old photos. Photoshop does most of it with a single click now, and any 14 year old can do what took me years to achieve. Sucks to be me. In any case AI isn&#039;t going to stop just because of some copyrights grey area. I&#039;m making the argument that what an AI does is not much different from learning by yourself, during some years of studying light, composition, framing, anatomy, etc etc, condensed into a neatly packed &quot;training data&quot; package. Humans have that training data as well, it just takes longer to learn and practice vs an actual machine.", "time": 1668173735, "resto": 434812}, {"no": 437841, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)08:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p437840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;437840</a><br>2/2<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and I am really curious how you think it would be fair for real existing people with real existing jobs and real existing children should be ripped of like that &#039;because cool toy that draws my dnd characters&#039;</span><br><br>It&#039;s not, like most new tech.

I&#039;m already very acquainted with PS so illustrator seems like it would be a slight adjustment, but I&#039;m still unsure which is better suited for digital projects. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 &quot;just keep getting cracked versions&quot;</span><br>If I could get stable versions without the risk of installing malware or getting sued I wouldn&#039;t be posting this lol", "filename": "gendopose", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 150, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674064727404776, "time": 1674064727, "md5": "CdIvjU299yXx6oTAV3fT1w==", "fsize": 4897, "resto": 429863}, {"no": 440076, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:18:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are there any good alternatives to fiverr for commissioning designs for a brand or business logo?", "time": 1674101918, "resto": 429863}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 423588, "now": "12/14/21(Tue)01:20:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Redesign this from the ground up.

You got some people going hard in on white and/or black from different sides: you got that black for the punkish elements, the dark tech/apocalyptic feel, and on the other side, you have this optimistic retro-futuristic white and blue, or whichever other colors added in. A good mix between styles that feared the coming years and ones that eagerly awaited it. Forgot that they had urban styles in too, with skate culture and rap going strong. Also had those 70s throwbacks that were a lot more materialistic like the smileys, colorful swirls, the curves to the clothes, etc. <br>I can&#039;t really pinpoint a single look to the era, but it at least felt as if the era was unsure of itself, unsure of the future, and each aesthetic was a sort of answer to that. Hope that doesn&#039;t sound too pretentious!", "time": 1653315302, "resto": 424227}, {"no": 430568, "now": "05/25/22(Wed)07:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_2916", "ext": ".jpg", "w":

In their heyday, both the rough fill and more precise brickwork was additionally covered by smooth limestone stucco, which was then painted, often with elaborate murals (often the true fresco technique, the paint applied to the wet stucco before it sets so the color is fused into the stucco rather then a paint layer) and engraved reliefs, sculptural facades and panels or friezes, and other accents and decorations. <br><br>Ruins also represent a tiny bit of the actual cities: You&#039;re generally only seeing a few temples that happen to be left standing or aren&#039;t still buried. In reality, Mesoamerican cities generally had urban cores, with dozens or hundreds of temples, palaces (refers to both elite residences and administrative buildings), ball courts, and other ceremonial, civic, and communal buildings and infrastructure (roads, aqueducts, reservoirs, etc: Complex waterworks systems were pretty common) built of stone and painted, organized around large open plazas to maximize public viewing and movement, as well as ritual alignments between different structures. <br><br>Around this, you then had suburbs of commoner residences (usually thatch or adobe brick, in sets facing a shared small plaza/patio, called &quot;patio groups&quot;) interspersed with agricultural land, with the suburbs radiating out and gradually decreasing in density often without a clear endpoint.

The text at the top should be more centered and probably a little bit smaller. With that chess piece it seems like its gonna fall off the edge. You could keep the button where it is but make it a little smaller, I&#039;d probably move that to the center too, makes it feel less like a browser window. <br><br>2. Use a better typeface/font, maybe something more condensed and bold? Something you&#039;d see on a sports ad or something. For instance Acumin Pro or Knockout are ones I use.<br><br>3. Color. The purple and yellowish green you have there looks a little plain. Look up color palates on google for inspo.
