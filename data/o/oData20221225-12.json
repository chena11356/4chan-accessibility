There are many places that having a convertible is a danger to you and those in your car. You don&#039;t want to be in a convertible around a lot of the &quot;homeless encampments&quot; say in many of the cities in California. Also in areas with a large basketball american population. Convertibles also are going to attract a lot of very jealous poorfags that hate the fact that you have something they don&#039;t.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003. They are all different rule sets.", "time": 1671899764, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26193240, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)13:41:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26192651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26192651</a><br>the Renault RS Spyder is my carfu<br>thanks for posting the HYPERRARE GT1 model", "time": 1671907282, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26193360, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)14:43:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190494</a><br>Where can I watch these races?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

Everything ultimately must be done. <br>Cars are simply one of the first on the agenda because they have a relatively short service life, the tun-around time to designing them is shorter, the technology to achieve 100% replacement with BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs already exists, and countries have jurisdiction over new cars sold in their territory. <br>Unlike for instance ships where the technology exists but ships often fly a flag of convenience and aren&#039;t subject to local laws, or Airplanes where hydrogen and battery based aircraft are still in early development.<br><br>The phase out of internal combustion engine cars as daily use vehicles, and fossil fuel power over the next 30 years, in favor of clean nuclear power and vehicles run from that will eliminate about 20GT of annual emissions. This includes secondary effects of eliminating fossil fuel use like a 1/3 reduction in the amount of oceanic shipping, and reductions in fugitive emissions from fossil fuel extraction.<br>That&#039;s not all emissions, but it is a significant amount.<br><br>Even if batteries did only last 5 years before they needed to be recycled, the production cost of the battery in emissions is significantly less than the production cost of a whole car, and right now with only 27% of the US grid being clean baseload energy the pay back period for a whole 100kWh car is less than 2 years. In a few decades when nuclear power is more than 40% of the grid that payback period will be even shorter.<br>Especially when you consider that in fact current generation EV batteries last 20+ years in their automotive phase, and then a decade or more longer in home storage applications.", "filename": "c6q4p9bfxtr71", "ext": ".png", "w": 3436, "h": 2146, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671771466547174, "time": 1671771466, "md5": "6pZnJ/3TJH1rpkuRpcXjgw==", "fsize": 2664925, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189365, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189098</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;average car</span><br>Leaf is a shitbox and not average.<br>Now factor in increased electricity prices and battery replacement cost.", "time": 1671779474, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189368, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:12:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189102</a><br>Nobody cares, take a deep breath.", "filename": "want a smoke", "ext": ".webm", "w": 864, "h": 992, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671779546463768, "time": 1671779546, "md5": "67p9TjkKSGmAi0tG8H0Hvg==", "fsize": 1231876, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189506, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26188071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26188071</a><br>wrong", "time": 1671784066, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189609, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:22:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189141</a><br>That infographic is a heaping load of shit, quit spamming it at every opportunity no one believes your blatant shilling", "time": 1671787368, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189627, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:34:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189141</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IEA</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global Carbon Project</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IPCC</span><br>Oh gee I sure am willing to gobble up and believe all the bullshit that pro-EV goyim organisations put on my screen!
