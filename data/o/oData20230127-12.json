I think the last time Codies remotely gave a fuck about livery design, was Dirt Rally 1, given how they got some obscure BRC liveries in from 2015-2016 and the other liveries still resembled some IRL liveries from other racing series. (Example, the standard Evo X livery in Dirt Rally 1 resembled the Ohlins Racing livery from Grid 1&#039;s DLC Evo X). After Dirt Rally 1, they just tossed any sort of livery in a quick livery editor, and called it a day there.<br>That said, Spyker Squadron was pure SOVL, and it is sad that they went under in a desperate attempt to save Saab in 2011.

If you remember, Porsche had an exclusive licence with Electronic Arts for the Need For Speed games at the time, which meant that while the AI could drive Porsche 911 GT3 RSR cars in GRID 1, the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event. The three teams running the Porsches in the game are all driven by licenced drivers, there is not a single fictional team allowed to drive them. Ferrari also was considering an exclusivity deal around that time, and decided to jank their licence for GRID 1 at the last minute, leading to the Ferrari 430 GT2 and Ferrari 550 Maranello GT1 cars to be cut just for release, which meant traces of those cars were still in the game files at launch, despite being unusable for anyone in the game!", "time": 1674694125, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296332, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;re never getting P2P back</span>", "filename": "TOUGE", "ext": ".webm", "w": 852, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694126443080, "time": 1674694126, "md5": "bk4tjgtmh7KCvFJhv3lI6Q==", "fsize": 2983497, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296341, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event.</span><br>yeah that&#039;s what I was talking about, codies must have had the elms licence , this is exactly how gtr2 got away with porsches and ferraris too", "time": 1674694336, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296321</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ui is ass</span><br>did every ui designer get lobotomized at the same time?", "filename": "1647449061758", "ext": ".webm", "w": 789, "h": 444, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694339879101, "time": 1674694339, "md5": "SA99oqca3AJECLWvgciM6w==", "fsize": 3001982, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296349, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296342</a><br>Why aren&#039;t we allowed actual needles on our gauges anymore?", "time": 1674694445, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296364, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:56:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296143</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t know if they edited out logos.</span><br>Nope, right there on the fender.", "filename": "Race Driver Grid Screenshot 2023.01.13 - 21.07.38.82", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694614565671, "time": 1674694614, "md5": "hmRw+N/dt7C/FDGGdh1Agw==", "fsize": 2208422, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296383, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296349</a><br>devs in big cities traumatized at the sight of a needle", "time": 1674695134, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296387, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:06:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26295633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26295633</a><br>Ugly fugly 70&#039; Challenger.

But if electric cars are still $.04 a mile even with all the extra fees they pay then its no question why people are switching.<br>Simple economics.

If you live in an area with a lot of salt then chances are parts of it can corrode internally. Is the alternator not charging at all? You should try to stick a multimeter to the battery poles with the car running and check the voltage. If it&#039;s less than 14V you probably have a bad alternator.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

To be fair, you have to have a high degree of technical skill, and driving ability, to understand the nuances of the M60/M62 platform. But once you do, the twin overhead cam, 4 valve per cylinder, monster of a V8 can fully come to life. The four-and two fifths liter engine produces an incredible 292 horse power, and slams down 440 newton meters of torque into the rear wheels. This refined German beast has the power of variable valve timing, of VANOS, which is the most reliable and effective way of keeping torque through the entire power band. Therefore, the superior German engineering shines through in this incredible V8. Let\u2019s not forget about the unbelievable quality and weight savings of the plastic dual-row timing chain guides, and the extra high-quality lightweight all-aluminum block. The m60 and m62 really offer an unrivaled refined German V8 muscle car experience found in not a single other engine.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost.

First, the old truck in the first pic is 2wd vs a 4wd new truck. If you got a 4wd truck back in the old days it came with a factory lift. As an aside, compared to today&#039;s &quot;it snows where I live so I need 4wd&quot; in the old days 4wd trucks weren&#039;t even in the same catalog as the main product line. It was assumed normal people bought 2wd trucks, even if they had to sometimes go a little offroad. Then you had the special catalog for loggers and hunters with the 4wd trucks.<br><br>Second, in the second pic they&#039;re comparing a long bed old truck vs short bed newer trucks. Beds didn&#039;t magically get shorter in 1980. You always could choose an 8&#039; or 6.5&#039; bed. You can still get a single cab, 8&#039; bed truck even if they&#039;re not big sellers. And the newer trucks in that pic are crew cab models which by default.

It sold poorly, being panned for being too small and too slow for Americans, and not competitively fuel efficient or cheap compared to subcompact competition.

The iQ was seen as a smarter Smart car with more maneuverability, but ultimately did not succeed since even Europeans don&#039;t really need a city car this small unless they&#039;re a city slicker.

My dad surprised my mother with one in 2000. Neighbors would be in the driveway pressed up against the glass. I was 12 and also thought it was rhe coolest thing. Acquired my license in it. It worked for over 14 years as far as the powertrain. The back adjustment lever on the seat snapped and broke off right at the base, maybe 8-9 years in. Dad never got it fixed. The seat is still locked in that very same position to this day, across 3 semi-permanent drivers since. Including the time my younger brother cosplayed as a part-time drug lord and semi-crashed it in the parking lot of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store two states away and got it impounded two states away. Dad had to tow it 400mi back home but I refused to go with him to help. He died shortly after and I wish I had gone with him to have that one last chance to bond with dad, over this absolute piece of shit Fischer Price Tupperware Amerishit car. It&#039;s just rotting away behind mom&#039;s garage now, like a redneck memorial to him and our family.

Normal fags such as Doug demuro mistake this for \u2018understeer\u2019 and indeed it can contribute to understeer.

The engine is in the back. You get better traction on the rear wheels but when the gas is applied that extra traction is taken from the front wheels. The result is understeer. <br><br>And 911s and mid engines also have a higher risk of oversteer which can be very expensive if it goes wrong unlike understeer which is easy to manage. Go down the grid at an Indy or F1 race where the cars are \u2018neutral\u2019 by design and you\u2019ll find drivers still prefer under or oversteer dialed in depending on their style. <br><br>The upside to Audi is power and traction. The downside is weight and where the weight is. Idk if Audi has ever made a light weight car. The real downside is the computer and traction management in an S car will constantly be fighting you on track in little ways. It\u2019s too aggressive. It works very well but at the cost of your brake pads.
