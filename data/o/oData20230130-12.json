turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

Right now most BEVs have the equivalent energy of 2-3 gallons of gasoline which translates to about the same range that similar gas cars get from 12-15 gallons of gas.<br>Next-generation solid-state batteries will probably be the choice for high performance BEVs in the near future since they&#039;ll enable both 6+ gallon equivalent batteries, with similar range and refill times compared to 20 gallon fuel tanks, while also bringing a new level of safety.<br><br>When its possible to put a 2 gallon equivalent 68kWh battery pack into a Honda E, or a 3.5 gallon equivalent 120kWh battery pack into a car like a Model 3, its probably all over for internal combustion.<br>Battery pack density has already increased to 200 Wh/kg. That&#039;s a 70% improvement from the original Tesla Roadster&#039;s 117 Wh/kg pack. Both of the capacities I just mentioned would be possible with just a 250Wh/kg pack density.<br>That may not even require a revolution in technology like the upcoming 500 Wh/kg structural solid state battery packs.", "time": 1675014135, "resto": 26298466}, {"no": 26307980, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)13:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26301330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26301330</a><br>Possibly the only good thing he has done.", "time": 1675018113, "resto": 26298466}, {"no": 26308109, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)14:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26299653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26299653</a><br>Thank u for bringing our hopes up lad", "filename": "1672678516861890", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1102, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1675020889665465, "time": 1675020889, "md5": "w8GuciiVVD5Obj0vYolNtw==", "fsize": 177727, "resto": 26298466}, {"no": 26308634, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26299653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26299653</a>", "filename": "SecondhandMadeupFireant-size_restricted", "ext": ".gif", "w": 268, "h": 170, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1675033436709915, "time": 1675033436, "md5": "zvYD8Tn1YnXwndR6IIrDzQ==", "fsize": 1265622, "resto": 26298466}, {"no": 26309492, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:13:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26307775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26307775</a><br>tldr and reddit spacing<br>Cope and seethe", "time": 1675048385, "resto": 26298466}, {"no": 26309593, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)22:41:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26299653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26299653</a><br>I guess what happened was that Akio saw that their was a growing movement to oust him and to turn the company into.
