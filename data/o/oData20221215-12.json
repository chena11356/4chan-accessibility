I dunno what to think anymore but I&#039;m pretty tired of it. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s Oculus, but is it maybe Kunos&#039; fault for not providing enough support for the CV1? I mean, other VR games I&#039;ve played run decent to great, so... is it maybe AMD&#039;s fault? Their drivers have kinda been sucking dick lately. Either way, feels bad man.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door. My hope is that between a coolant system flush, a heater core backflush, a new blend door actuator, and a new blend door heat to the cab can be restored.", "time": 1670472295, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26146386, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)23:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>This has to be a troll.

I say &#039;almost universal because while my throttle housing had one M8\u00d71.25 thread that fitted perfectly the throttle return is a M10\u00d7 1.25 thread, I figured out I could just drill and tap the end of the old cable. However the only way to buy a M10\u00d71.25 tap on a Sunday is as part of a 40 piece tap and die set at any given hardware store.<br>But after all of this and some more &#039;Magic hands&#039; I have a fully functioning bike with zero throttle slack. Those &quot;universal&quot; cables were a mm or two short, so if you as much as breathe on the throttle it revs to 6k. There&#039;s no excess tension on the cable it&#039;s somehow perfectly to length. And it&#039;s great, she feels more responsive than ever, in fact it&#039;s soo much better I&#039;ve almost stopped complaining about the final drive ratio being too short.<br>Anyway good luck with your oil changes or whatever.", "filename": "20221212_175412", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1960, "h": 4032, "tn_w": 60, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670823227477288, "time": 1670823227, "md5": "mt+/+eoBYYxgG8aJeP04iA==", "fsize": 915123, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26158803, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)10:23:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26157677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26157677</a><br>gxp&#039;s aren&#039;t v6, it&#039;s an ls4.", "time": 1670858611, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26159628, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)15:52:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And it&#039;s cleared out, tomorrow I&#039;ll wake up early to put up the remaining dust covers.", "filename": "9A5586CF-658A-485E-9C5D-754FE481F615", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 490, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 47, "tim": 1670878334541733, "time": 1670878334, "md5": "nepYHg0pV3HI9cFVPCUczg==", "fsize": 166239, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26159756, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)16:32:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Chased down a few small vaccum leaks but it&#039;s still having a bit of trouble when clutching in near idle.

To be more accurate: Bacteria developed in the lacquer pools. They changed the behavior of the lacquer so it hat a lower cohesion especially at very narrow parts like the underside of the doors. <br>That being said: <br>1) Not every 210 had this problem. The lacquer pools got refilled every week or other week. Only cars who went through the pool when the lacquer was already a few days old (= lots oc bacteria) had this problem.<br>2) Every 210 who had this problem has already rusted away many years ago. We are talking about the 00s and early 10s. Don&#039;t forget that the 210 only ran between 1995 and 2002.<br>So today there&#039;s honestly no reason to be overly afraid of rust since what&#039;s still left has a normal rust-level just like you&#039;d expect from a 20+X years old car. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;electronics are a mess</span><br>Somewhat true but then again: Every car&#039;s electronics are a mess if they have been designed and built so many decades ago. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you manage to preserve a good AMG</span><br>Most if not all AMGs on the market have had many users and are more than often beat to shit. Stay away from AMGs and other large displacement 210s.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is this a classic?</span><br>It depends who you ask. I for example really adore the lines of the 210, especially the rear part. But just like back in the days there are also lots of people who hate the headlight design. <br>It will be a good investment if you take care of it. They are still really cheap because they are too young to be considered real classics, unlike 124s. But I guess we&#039;re only a few years away from a time where 210s get that attention too.<br>Never forget: Back in the days NOBODY thought that 123s or 124s would become sought-after classics in the future. Now take a good look what you gotta pay for a plain jane 124 station wagon for example.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims.
