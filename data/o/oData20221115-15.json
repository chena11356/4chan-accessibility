At the top measuring location (closest to the head) in the non-thrust direction my bore gauge is reading a diameter of 74.92 mm (the nominal diameter is 75.00-75.02 mm). I&#039;ve never seen this before and I still can&#039;t even wrap my head around how it&#039;s possible for a cylinder to shrink. In the thrust side the diameter is 75.05 or so which is normal and then down the bore it&#039;s also normal. It&#039;s just in the non-thrust axis at the top that the cylinders are smaller than nominal diameter. I am not measuring at the absolute top where there is carbon deposit, I&#039;m measuring below the deposits.<br><br>Anyone have any idea what&#039;s happening here? I checked this shit like 5 times and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not my tools because cylinders 1 and 4 are fine as well as 2 and 3 as you get down the bore. Should I take it to a machine shop to get checked? Or just overbore it to be safe? Pistons are looking pretty good which is why I don&#039;t want to overbore it if I don&#039;t have to. Is there any possibility that the block is warped in such a way to affect cylinders 2 and 3 and squish them?

I&#039;ve never seen this before and I still can&#039;t even wrap my head around how it&#039;s possible for a cylinder to shrink. In the thrust side the diameter is 75.05 or so which is normal and then down the bore it&#039;s also normal.
