Pre-orders are gone, and we don&#039;t want to create a 6 week lead time (pre-order + production).<br><br>- I worked briefly with desuprint who informed me of issues with production, a large one being that Taiyo works in Inkscape primarily and the design would have to be completely rebuilt in Illustrator along with the white ink layer. desuprint also had the foil we wanted to do it on, however he has told me a while ago he is unable to reproduce it. The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass. Paying over $10 for a sticker is stupid, and that&#039;s ironic because my store will only offer tracked shipping in the future and I apologize for any international orders because shipping is literally going to eat people&#039;s asses.<br><br>- Many things have been on my backlog for a while. In the past 6 months, nearly every original Taiyo design has been under renovation along with new(er) projects. I reflected over my FOTM drop and figured it wasn&#039;t something I wanted to force myself to do like I did before after Grandmasterslices gave me input that made me realize I was pushing myself way too hard and getting frustrated over nothing.<br><br>tl;dr no thanks, see you when the store is open someday.", "time": 1674111193, "resto": 26265022, "trip": "!!VDR3ijdJ5Rz"}, {"no": 26274151, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)02:01:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26273846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26273846</a><br>Damn you right.

People assume that a Japanese (or Euro) sports car that competes with an American car should basically have the same performance and qualities, as they are competitors. In reality, Japanese and Euro brands CAN&#039;T compete with American sports cars because they are born from an entirely different legal world. Japs and Euros face stiff taxes on displacement and in some cases outright bans due to emissions bullshit. This means you either literally CAN&#039;T make a V8 car or if you do it has to be so expensive due to taxes/fees that it is a luxury car by default. Consider a Mustang GT which in Netherlands costs something like $80k... if you&#039;re going to spend $80k on a car most people would rather pay $100k and have a non-dogshit interior, whereas adding that additional $20k in price to an American mustang (going from $40k to $60k) is a much different proposition. However, the other thing people don&#039;t realize is that comparing 0-60 times and such as if faster always means better is the definition of bench racing.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

Modern VW is not that bad reliability wise. the B7 era was very good. Not sure about the B8. Really, VW hate is overblown. Even when they had timing chain issues it was above 100k, and fixing it wasn&#039;t over 3 grand. These deluded JDM fags think a 3k repair bill is the end of the world. <br><br>But I would do it.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

The reasons engines lose power towards redline is down to piston distance and total volume as the piston moves faster and faster. 10,000 foot view being you can imagine the piston essentially moving so fast it starts to outrun the explosion so less torque is transfered to the pistol face and crank. If a vehicle still makes more power right up to redline then the redline has been engineered to be lower than the engine can handle usually for longevities sake.<br><br><a href=\"#p26319442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26319442</a><br>I know that pain. 798 here.
