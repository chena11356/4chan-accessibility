Just because it was just that little bit closer.<br><br>On coming out I saw some lady in a car backing out, very poorly, but obviously backing out and some dude in a Tacoma just drives right up bumper to bumper behind her despite being on a road wide enough for 3 cars to pass and he just sits there and waits, perplexes and agitated that this car is in his way, until she drives forward a little enough for him to drive arrow straight still going within inches of her car and then rolling down the window to scram at her while blowing his horn and then zoom off.<br><br>I then realized that the AI in GTA4 was in fact accurate.", "time": 1676545649, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362110, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BMW driver refuses to find another spot because he knows his car might not last another 50 yards</span>", "time": 1676546550, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362148, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:50:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359606</a><br><a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw black</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have asian gf</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to mall</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sends me out to hold parker spot three banks over while she drives over</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;karen going wrong direction in parking lane instantly appears</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;you cant stand there sir&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stare at her while saying nothing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she discombabulates into threatening to call the police and mall security</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she gives up deflated and attempts to go wrong direction</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;has to back out the entire lane</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;asian gf finally arrives and almost scrapes the car next to her</span>", "time": 1676548236, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362179, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:11:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362148</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;asian gf finally arrives and almost scrapes the car next to her</span><br>this is what you get for not driving yourself", "time": 1676549476, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362188, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:18:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362148</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw black</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hold parker spot three banks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;threatening to call the police </span><br>Bruh you&#039;re lucky she didn&#039;t, pigs would have rolled up and shot you for no fucking reason.", "time": 1676549903, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362200, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:25:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360406</a><br>The fucking DeVry shirt.", "time": 1676550312, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362203, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:25:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br>she soo fucking fat, she need to park her fat ass in parking spot XDDDD LAMOOOO", "time": 1676550342, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362215, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:30:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360423</a><br>Marrying a hologram of your favorite anime girl doesn&#039;t count.", "time": 1676550628, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362223, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362179</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gf wants to drive everytime we take my car</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;always take my car because hers is boring</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refuses to get non boring car &quot;its too expensive&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pays $800 a month with an insurances for a honda accord</span><br><br><a href=\"#p26362188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362188</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no raisin</span>", "filename": "1599819312775", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676550874014484, "time": 1676550874, "md5": "iQmfiHw/RhgHvLPel1ZfvA==", "fsize": 558551, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362227, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:35:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360406</a><br>lose some weight.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support.

Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers.

Its much easier for Europe and the United States to stabilize their electricity prices by investing in clean nuclear power than secure any other energy source. <br><br><a href=\"#p26360736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360736</a><br>The &quot;ban&quot; on sales of new pure internal combustion engine cars 12 years from now is really just a Sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the legacy car makers that they need to keep up with Tesla and BYD because they aren&#039;t going to get another bailout.", "time": 1676500993, "resto": 26360185}, {"no": 26360784, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360775</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They certainly aren&#039;t making any effort to update it</span><br>The US just approved its first new nuclear reactor in quite a while, with wind and solar deployments rolling out at record pace.", "time": 1676501159, "resto": 26360185}, {"no": 26360841, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)18:15:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360712</a><br>batteries are made by chinks<br>they hold 90% of the rare earth metals required<br>they&#039;ve already started to sell their bug pods in europe<br>they have the knowhow required to build electric cars at a massive scale<br>this is a chink takeover of europe<br>also every country bare france has become hysterical about nuclear and i&#039;m sure they will make up some another catastrophe so they ban it there too", "filename": "Xev-YOYO-colours-electric-blue-ext", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 501, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1676502951863835, "time": 1676502951, "md5": "W4AOQUAgO7BOCpkhEuULpg==", "fsize": 54447, "resto": 26360185}, {"no": 26360843, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)18:17:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360712</a><br>hahaha, germany already shutting down their nuclear reactors and going back to coal fucking kek", "time": 1676503053, "resto": 26360185}, {"no": 26360847, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)18:19:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360784</a><br>Nice, one reactor after half of them have been shut down, wind with unrecyclable blades that need to be replaced yearly and take 40 gallons of oil every 6 months, and solar that takes huge amounts of rare minerals that are extremely polluting to extract that last maybe 10 years before they have to be replaced and can only be thrown in a landfill.

Crime and drug/alcohol usage spiked in 2020. And they haven&#039;t really come down. People didn&#039;t get sober during covid, they developed addictions. Part of it is simply that there are a higher percentage of intoxicated drivers on the road today than any time in recent memory. Then there&#039;s also people engaging in social media. Used to be people worried about texting and driving, now the main concern is trying to record video or take pics while driving in an effort to go viral. <br><br>And then on top of that, cops have pretty much backed off in most places and are not policing as aggressively as they were pre-2020. You either get caught in a speed trap or you basically have free reign. People are exploiting this. In the downtown area of my city there are regular &quot;sideshows&quot; where black and hispanic &quot;car enthusiasts&quot; take over intersections and do burnouts while a crowd of onlookers smoke marijuana and consume alcohol, among other substances. This is not something that happened even a decade ago. <br><br>I would also somewhat blame the abundance of high powered cars today.

Being surrounded by trees while climbing to the top of a narrow, twisty mountain road, to then be greeted by a scenic outlook over the 1/3rd of the island is a vastly superior choice. I&#039;ve been driving for 12 years and have never crashed or been ticketed. The only thing I&#039;ve paid for has been gas and parts. Also, the nearest track is over 2k miles from me (I live on an island,) and it would cost a minimum of $4k just to ship my shitbox round trip before even considering travel expenses. I have no interest in wasting hours in a day researching the best prices for hotels, tickets, and shipping costs, and then needing to wait for it to get between destinations, and then take days off just to go driving to drive during their operational hours on whatever days they allow, when I can just immediately go out for a drive whenever I feel like it for free and also come back to the comfort of my own home at any time. As I said, it&#039;s possible to speed responsibly. I don&#039;t care if that makes your butt hurt. Yeah, there are a lot of shitty drivers on the road, but drunk drivers are significantly more hazardous than some people going for some spirited driving in the mountains or dragging on a lone straight.

In my province of British Columbia they implemented this over 10 years ago. While it was mainly chinks in their high powered exotic cars racing around Vancouver that led to civil forfeiture being a thing, here&#039;s the problem with that: Around the same time they also implemented short to longer term impounds of vehicles for street racing. So you&#039;ll lose your ride for at least 7 days, pay a hefty fine plus towing/storage costs, and possibly lose your license if you have prior history of racing/stunting. I believe this to be more than enough to handle anyone that&#039;s a problem. Now, while I have no problems with rich Hongers getting fucked here, police are given a wide margin of discretion on when to simply impound, or seize for civil forfeiture. Stunting/street racing here encompasses a variety of things... Simply burning rubber could technically get your shit seized for forfeiture, although I&#039;m not aware of this happening. Simply spinning your tires on a slick wet street could get your shit impounded, whether you meant to or not. The law here is very vague, in what you can do and can&#039;t do, and what repercussions you may face. Of course we all have our chance in court here to &#039;tell it to the judge&#039;, but never before has civil forfeiture been a thing here for vehicles unless they were proven to be bought by proceeds of crime (drug dealers), or utilized in a serious crime (robbing a bank). The threshold for forfeiture has dropped too low now, where spinning tires in the wet could be considered stunting, which is now considered stunting, now considered a serious crime, leading to possible seizure.", "time": 1676457728, "resto": 26357406}, {"no": 26359193, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:05:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26358964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26358964</a><br>The laws we have are put in place by people elected by the majority.<br>Laws change depending on what&#039;s required at the time.<br>You are welcome to try and convince the majority to be soft on crime, see how that works out for you.", "time": 1676466302, "resto": 26357406}, {"no": 26359198, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:09:57", "name": "Bepis", "com": "<a href=\"#p26357523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26357523</a><br>Agree with this<br><br>But that\u2019s also not really a Florida facist law, that shit happens all over.

Full story:<br>I jumped another car a few days ago. My battery (3-4 years old) had a ton of blue corrosion stuff around it. A couple days later it wouldn&#039;t start and couldn&#039;t even be jumped. I used baking soda to clear the blue corrosion enough to get the battery out since I couldn&#039;t even disconnect it first.<br>Then I put the new battery in and it started 3 times without problem since then... But now it&#039;s completely dead and not even lights are coming on. What&#039;s the problem? My plan is in the morning I&#039;ll take the battery out and then put it right back in since when I installed the new battery at first it worked 3 times before dying.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

Should I buy a used car in the 10k-15k range or just opt for something new in the 25k-35k range? either way, what are some of the best used or new cars in my price ranges and what are some cars new or used that i should definitely stay away from?", "filename": "buying-car-online", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1676435816987789, "time": 1676435816, "md5": "TF5Wl1UazXLgs68YOiWmbA==", "fsize": 227798, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "so-ive-been-driving-a-2001-nissan-altima-since-i", "replies": 10, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 26358614, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:38:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26358612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26358612</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my Altima is on its last leg</span><br>What&#039;s wrong with it?", "time": 1676435905, "resto": 26358612}, {"no": 26358638, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)23:51:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26358614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26358614</a><br>well, besides the aesthetic stuff like the paint peeling off and multiple large rust spots on the roof, A/C doest work (i live in california), sun roof leaks whenever it rains, suspension on the passenger side is shot and the car is noticeably lower in that side, ignition switch will sometimes decide not to work and im stuck there trying to turn my key for like 5 minutes until it finally decides to turn, and there has been tons of other things ive fixed through the years.

Have you considered the middleweight jap advs? the vstrom has the same crazy long maintenance period and reliability as the sv650, the versys shares the ninja 650s power plant just like the vulcan s and then there&#039;s the honda cb500x which is the forgotten budget little brother of the Africa twin", "time": 1676489192, "resto": 26358434}, {"no": 26360085, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:27:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360071</a><br>DR650 just werks even better, is more simple and basic, also had loads of spare parts, and will go more places.", "time": 1676489248, "resto": 26358434}, {"no": 26360089, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:27:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359954</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the one thing you diyd on your bike that looks okay</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drilled holes through it then wire tied into the frame</span>", "time": 1676489277, "resto": 26358434}, {"no": 26360091, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360066</a><br>Monster Rehab", "time": 1676489286, "resto": 26358434}, {"no": 26360092, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360066</a><br>WHISKY!!!", "filename": "Suspension", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1672, "h": 1254, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676489311336618, "time": 1676489311, "md5": "PuOhk7rhe+fDeyekdw3UzQ==", "fsize": 246719, "resto": 26358434}, {"no": 26360100, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:30:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360012</a><br>The DR650 is also underpowered and has &quot;doohickey&quot; type stuff too, but the DR650 is still better allround.

He said he knew but wanted me to test drive it anyway. Dealership was next to a couple of freeways. We both took it out. Was mild with the throttle at first. He told me to rev the shit out of it. So I did. Was actually impressed with toyotas version of vtec, but the body had too much roll to it in turns. Up and down the freeway revving the hell out of it. Pulled back to the dealership and the engine was clunking. Both looked at each other wide eyed and walked away. Later I told him I was sorry. He said he didn&#039;t know what I was talking about.
