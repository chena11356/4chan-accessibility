Get rid of it.<br>Also we could re-zone much of the car suburbs to return them to the farms they were originally built from.

Most young people don&#039;t want to live far from work anymore, since it doesn&#039;t usually save money. <br>After that, we could build rural streetcars and build up bus routes in the country. Again the east coast of the USA had these interurban electric railways, so it&#039;s literally just going to take reclaiming the land and building it back. It should have never left, since that handled the commute for farm workers prior to the &#039;60s when they were ripped out to make way for temporary foreign workers, corn syrup farms, and bloated car infrastructure.<br>And of course there&#039;s going to be people who don&#039;t want to take public transportation, but I don&#039;t care.

It is not only about taxing us to poverty, there has to be something else. My two cents: I believe that maybe they will turn this (entirely artificial and self created) energy crisis into an excuse as of why we need to adopt a forced public transport lifestyle.

I&#039;ve worked in the EV industry, specifically LEV&#039;s, and the batteries are just garbage. They don&#039;t hold a charge worth a shit, they die after a few years, they&#039;re incredibly expensive, and if you touch them wrong they explode. No thanks! I did an internship with a guy whose whole thing is he just forces EV batteries to explode under different conditions (he had this whole armored trailer filled with cameras and shit, it was wild) and after watching enough of those videos I decided I was never, ever going to charge an EV battery inside of a habitable structure again. They&#039;re literally incomplete bombs, waiting for something to disturb their structure just enough to go off. Terrifying. However, the practical advantages of electric motors are pretty profound when you really think about it - the instant torque, low maintenance, less points of failure etc as you mentioned are really an incredibly engineering leap. I used to tell people &quot;Think about how long a ceiling fan lasts. They basically never break, right? It&#039;s like that.&quot; and it is. My fantasy future vehicle though is a diesel-electric drive where a diesel generator charges a battery pack which drives electric motors. All of the advantages of ICE and all the advantages of electric motors. They probably wouldn&#039;t even cost that much more than current designs once we figure out the right mix, since it&#039;s all proven technology that already exists at the size and scale we&#039;d need.

The lawyer wouldn&#039;t give me a number after me repeating the question 3 times. She only gave an example of a similar case she did; hit and run, but with no real damage and the victim asked for 10k.

Sounds like a bullshit story though.<br>The lawyer didn&#039;t seem particularly enthusiastic when I spoke to her. Seems like she just wanted a number so she can tell me whether or not her client can afford it. I told her I&#039;ll get back to her next week after I crunch some numbers. Since the max penalty is going to be 6, 250 anyway, I was thinking it&#039;s fair to offer something around or below that as long as I can show proof (I don&#039;t think I have to though, since it&#039;s a settlement). We get nothing if it goes to court, since we aren&#039;t suing, we&#039;re just pressing charges. I honestly don&#039;t know how all this works legally, but I believe if we don&#039;t settle to drop the charges, she just goes to trial with us only showing up as witnesses. Most likely she&#039;ll be convicted, since the evidence and is pretty air tight.

I owned one for two years after having a cheap ass jeep patriot i got at 17 that lasted 11 years. The patriot was ok and it could offroad just enough. BUT the compass &quot;trailhawk&quot; was the biggest peice of shit. The brand new engine burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which I only found out because one day driving down the highway my engine shuts off at 60 mph after a &quot;low oil pressure&quot; warning flashed up for 5 seconds. This happened the first time aound 10k miles. And several times after that despite me pouring a fresh quart in once a month. I was then told that the oil consumption rate was normal by the dealership. Aside from that I had shit break on it constantly. Half the parts are from a fiat 500 and it&#039;s 4wd is actually just AWD. The final nail in the coffin was when my battery died, but it wasn&#039;t actually my battery.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA. During the BPR years Ratel would form the SRO which has been shaping GT racing for almost 30 years.", "time": 1671993842, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195774, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190601</a><br><a href=\"#p26190626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190626</a><br>I never get why europoor teams get so butthurt by large displacement engines in racing. like if your angry about murricans making 12L v8s and winning, maybe use larger engines your self instead of running on 1L v6s in your cars and expecting everyone else to do the same", "time": 1672002141, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_4518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672005636401813, "time": 1672005636, "md5": "gew40DwLhFVqlT44++al1Q==", "fsize": 192286, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26196163, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)19:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26195529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26195529</a><br>The Short-Tail F1 GTRs were nerfed throughout the 1996 season, to the point that they were heavier than the Road Car versions and only making about 400-ish Horsepower at best.

flinging shit at each other without actually knowing whose shit it is. <br><br>The GTS/R originally raced as a GT1 car when it debuted in 1996. Back then the main deciding factor of which category a car belonged was based on engine displacement. The Viper being 8.0L was firmly designated for GT1. When the FIA revised their rules for 1997 (mainly to allow for more exotic cars and technology like the CLK GTR), Chrysler had the GTS/R rehomologated for FIA&#039;s GT2. For the US races, they would race under the SCCA&#039;s GT2 category for USRRC races and IMSA/ACO&#039;s GTS category for ALMS. When USRRC gave way to Grand-Am, the GTS/R was in the GTO category until they renamed it GTS (many of the same cars as ACO, but under GARRA&#039;s rules) until Vipers were no longer running in the series. These different categories in different series were basically analogous to FIA&#039;s pre-&#039;97 regs.<br><br>When ACO adopted the FIA&#039;s newly revised GT regs essentially adapting the old GTS and GT classes as new GT1 and GT2, the GTS/R was categorized as a GT1 under the new rules.
