Ford&#039;s &#039;49 models, the result of wartime design work, were an upgrade in every way except the drivetrain which for the time being was still the same old roster of flathead V8s plus the I6. Ford&#039;s slab styling was roughly midway between GM&#039;s sleek aircraft designs and Chrysler&#039;s staid boxes, and it was the most favored of the three by European automobile designers. The antiquated solid axle and leaf spring suspension was replaced by a modern independent suspension with front coil springs and rear leaf springs.

The &#039;49 Fords had been rushed into production and numerous quality defects soon became apparent, so efforts were made to correct them on the &#039;50 models. Issues with the front end components were corrected and more insulation to reduce interior noise. The door locks were also improved after numerous issues with them coming open easily on the road. Sales increased to 1.2 million for the model year. Ford had not been able to bring out a true hardtop coupe in time to match Chevrolet so they made do with the Crestliner, a pseudo-hardtop with a padded vinyl roof. The soon-to-be-familiar Country Squire nameplate appeared on station wagon models.<br><br>The 1951 model year was the last of this generation of Fords.

Live For Speed. There are many reasons that it is still untouched to this day in terms of realism. It&#039;s not perfect, but physics wise it is more well-rounded than almost any other game. I actually gave up on sim racing shortly after getting into it, because I just couldn&#039;t get over the lack of &quot;butt feel&quot; considering I also had a car that I tracked in real life as well... but the ONLY game I could actually tolerate was Live For Speed. One of the main reasons is that the force feedback just felt better, couldn&#039;t really pinpoint why, but I was 100% sure. It was smoother, and never did anything unexpected. You can drift low hp cars without mods, and it felt just like doing it in real life. I tried other games, even with mods, but they all felt &quot;off&quot; in more than one way, and the force feedback would occasionally do wonky shit. Live for Speed is very basic in terms of content, it&#039;s old so the graphics are shit... but the feel is extremely good. Just trust me. Anyone I knew who actually tracked real cars agreed with me, regardless of what YouTube racers might say. This was back before Assetto Corsa and such, so I can&#039;t comment on it... but in my opinion, if all these games need tons of monds to enhance the actual feel or physics, aside from content/visual stuff, they must be lacking. The only think I vividly remember that was a negative in Live for Speed is that the tires get worn out and turn to ice quickly when drifting, but that&#039;s about it. Watching a replay where your tires flex and you lift a wheel if you drop a tire off track on such an old game just shows how ahead of it&#039;s time it was.", "time": 1670373480, "resto": 26141410}, {"no": 26142390, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:40:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;same image and thread as last week</span><br>Why?
