Rear main is unlikely, but if it is leaking it\u2019s a transmission out. Thermostat? Nah, that\u2019s no big deal especially on an M54. N52 powered ones are more of a bitch but I\u2019ve done it on jackstands without too much drama. Just make sure you do it at the same time as the water pump. Oil pan gasket is somewhat likely but they usually just weep. VCG is very common, not too bad to do either, especially on an M54, N52 is a bit more involved.<br>I kind of miss my E70 X5, had the 260 HP N52 in it. It was overall a pretty good vehicle. If you end up with one just preemptively replace the water pump and thermostat, not bad unless you\u2019re a wrenchlet. The DISA valves like to take a shit too, just don\u2019t buy Amazon chinkshit to replace them. Get the ones from FCPEuro, they\u2019re priced decently and decent quality. It\u2019s pretty obvious when they die, the car gets sluggish especially at part throttle and a lot of times you can hear them rattling. <br>They\u2019re not Toyota simple reliable vehicles, they have their quirks, but if you know what to pay attention to they\u2019re pretty good.

If a $160 Duralast 3yr dies at 2 years 9 months, they will give you $40 towards the new battery. It pissed me off so much the one time I called to see if a dead battery was still under warranty, guy on the phone told me it was, but it was only like 2 months left and I got $25 towards the new one, it would\u2019ve been cheaper to go to Walmart where the battery was like $40 cheaper.<br><br>Also Walmart has easy returns. They will go by the sticker on the battery if you don\u2019t have a receipt, and most of the time they don\u2019t even test it.

You&#039;re only hearing about it so much now because of the Internet and the fact that Cost of Living has never taken up more income than ever before.<br>It goes beyond the dumb rhetoric like avacado toast, lattes, and &quot;just get a roommate&quot; you make significantly less than your parents did at the same age and you work MORE hours.<br><br>Your parents bought a house far younger than you, you don&#039;t make anywhere near enough at such a young age to even attempt the same thing. Even if you could, your parents house was FAR better than what ever you might get into.", "time": 1673111437, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235708, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235689</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Largely because they can&#039;t afford NOT to.</span><br>They don&#039;t HAVE to adapt the &quot;AYO FUCK YALLZ I BE GETTINZ MINE MADE IT FROM BOTTEM NOW HERE&quot; jewish constructed negro-hebrew cringe attitude though", "time": 1673111797, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235713, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:17:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235708</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;AYO FUCK YALLZ I BE GETTINZ MINE MADE IT FROM BOTTEM NOW HERE&quot;</span><br>litterally zoomerspeak", "time": 1673111866, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235716, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:19:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235713</a><br>Yes retard<br>I&#039;ve also seen millennial women use &quot;fr&quot; and &quot;tho&quot; just like zoomers", "time": 1673111953, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235742, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:28:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235483</a><br>i can literally buy a del sol for 1000 euro and hang around with a bunch of 18-23 yros who race around in their cars at night here youre either stupid, dont go outside very often or a blackpill crusader and should kill yourself immediately", "time": 1673112522, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235755, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:34:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235663</a><br>You can thank boomers and Reagan for making school so expensive through the school funding cuts and privatizing all that shit.<br>The US actually paid for most of the tuition costs but the moment they stopped and handed off funding to banks the price skyrocketed.", "time": 1673112867, "resto": 26235175}, {"no": 26235767, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:41:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235674</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ESL</span><br>Not everyone is an English speaking Amerimutt<br>Besides Generation X is still the driving force that still working, harder than the following generations.

Comedy is a shield and a sword, it bypasses most people&#039;s defense and offence, so its the comfortable tool. Even when tis cringe.<br><br>2. Self loathing. Everyone is human, the side effect of acting like a scumbag is self loathing and self deprecation. Its natural. This feeds into insecurity which in turn is heaped ever harder upon comedy, and back to insecurity.<br><br>3. Insecurity. From self loathing comes Small dog syndrome. Small dogs bite and are violent and miserable, because they are so small as to be insecure in their role. The small dog always seeks to establish itself as greater than it is.<br><br>4. Seeking power. From insecurity comes power seeking, in this way it is expressed as acting atrocious in public or private settings UNDER the guise of comedy. By showing that you fully control the room and can subvert people&#039;s normal behavior and virtues, you establish perceived power, even if its through subconscious pity and disgust.

He was superstitious about their red hair, disapproving of their rambunctious lifestyles, and embittered over their considerable contribution to the success of the Ford Motor Company. In the early days of the Company the Dodges produced most of the Ford cars, everything except the bodies and tires and contributed ten thousand dollars toward the initiial capital of Ford, while Henry failed to contribute a cent. Ford planned to squeeze the Dodges out of the Company by diverting income to produce increasing portions of parts in house.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the Dodge brothers left the Ford Motor Company to produce their own cars in 1914, they adopted as their logo two interlocking deltas with the initials DB in the center. The logo in place resembled the Star of David, giving rise to the rumor around Ford that the brothers were Jewish. Ford notoriously disliked and distrusted the Jewish race.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The interlocking delta design was actually an ancient middle eastern insignia, that was popular among masons, including the Dodge Brothers. To the Dodge brothers, it also reflected the unity, fidelity and brotherhood shared by the brothers who were so close that they refused to accept any mail not addressed to both of them. The Detroit Saturday Night magazine commented on the Ford rumors that \u2018[T]he theory that they [the Dodge brothers] were Jews is quite as sane as any other we have seen in the anti-semitic antics of Ford\u2019s paper [The Dearborn Independent]\u201d The Dodge brothers both died in 1920 and were laid to rest in a shared mausoleum of an Egyptian Revival Architecture.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The emblem contains the design of the interlocking deltas, (without the DB) capped with Egyptian style metal latticework and a crescent moon on the top.

The team that year aimed for overall victory and as such acquired a car that could bring them that. That said car was the 2002 GT500 spec Honda NSX. The mid-engine car was already a proven victor in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship thanks to the three wins earned by Nakajima Racing, and one each by Mugen and Dome in the 2002 season.<br><br>The #3 Honda NSX was entered under the Sport Auto banner and was driven by Armin Hahne, Robert Lechner, Markus Oestreich, and Robin Liddell. A few changes were done to the car to accommodate Nurburgring and the length of the race. One of those changes was the V6 engine being down tuned from the JGTC regulated 500hp to 420hp for reliability. Other changes include endurance lights and Michelin tires of which the car never ran on in the JGTC. The NSX weigh a minimum of 1200kg as par the rules of A6, the class the Honda competed in at Nurburgring.<br><br>The #3 Sport Auto NSX had a small amount of kilometres under its belt before contesting the 24 Hours of Nurburgring. Lack of testing however didn&#039;t stop the German squad from placing inside the top 15 in qualifying, showing the potential of a JGTC car in uncharted territory. The NSX successfully started the race keeping up with the cars ahead of it which included DTM derived machinery from Audi and Opel. The car however experienced technical problems early in the race and completed 38 laps/7 hours before retiring. https://youtu.be/LRKIAK5Yw3w", "filename": "1280px-Honda_NSX-R_(24h_N\u00fcrburgring)",

The leash on the Group 6 prototypes was already loosened to allow manufacturers to run new engines and/or cars a year early. Porsche used this opportunity to test the engine for the upcoming 956 Group C car in anger during the 24 Hours of Le Mans. One of their privateers, Kremer Racing used the same loophole for Le Mans, not to look ahead but to bring an old legend out of retirement; the Porsche 917.<br><br>The Group 6 regulations of 1972, which stipulated a three-litre displacement limit, had rendered the 917 obsolete from World Championship event. In the following decade, Kremer Racing actually restored one of the original 917s for a customer, so they had intimate knowledge of the twelve-cylinder engined racer. The two Kremer brothers reckoned there was life left in the design, especially if it was updated to suit the latest tyre technology. So, instead of bringing one of the existing cars out of retirement, Kremer Racing decided to build a brand new 917, with support from Porsche.<br><br>One of the main reasons to start from scratch was that Kremer reckoned the original all-aluminium spaceframe chassis would no longer be up to the task. Already stressed to and at times beyond its limits, the lightweight frame was likely not capable of dealing with the much higher loads produced by 1981-specification, slick tyres. Using the drawings supplied by Porsche and a higher gauge material, a new, sturdier frame was built. The new chassis tipped the scales at 65 kg compared to 50 kg of the original. The suspension geometry was also altered to make the most of the latest tyre technology.", "time": 1673360057, "resto": 26233298}, {"no": 26245056, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:14:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Porsche offered Kremer Racing a choice of two versions of the Type 912 engine.

While the second option was obviously more powerful, it was also thirstier. Taking into consideration the particular needs of the Le Mans track with its long straights, the Kremers understandably opted for power over frugality.

Naturally, the original design of the 917 was carried over but again changes were made to incorporate the latest ideas in aerodynamics. Ideas was the best description as there was no time to actually test the final package in the wind-tunnel. Among the most obvious alterations were the removal of rounded lower sections of the body in favour of slab sides to help generate some ground effect. A full width rear wing was fitted, mounted between two sizeable tail fins.<br><br>With backing from French real estate company Malardeau Enterprises and BP, the 917 K/81 was fielded by Kremer Racing for the all-French line-up of Bob Wollek, Xavier Lapeyre and Guy Chausseuil. With the exception of a brief shakedown at the N\u00fcrburgring, the car was untested. As a result, it suffered from a variety of problems, in particular on the important long straights where the 917 barely breached the 300 km/h barrier. This was partly addressed by changing the gear ratios but it was also obvious that there were also aerodynamic problems.<br><br>With a qualifying time that was a full 17 seconds slower than the pole-sitting works Porsche, the new 917 started the race back in 18th.

The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800\u2013900 kilometres (500\u2013560 mi) per day. &quot;Amateurs&quot; typically struggle with the event. The rough terrain and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.<br><br>The Dakar rally features a much greater variety of vehicles than traditional rally&#039;s, including bikes, quads, and trucks. Dominant manufacturers within the Dakar Rally are KTM for bikes, Yamaha for quads and Kamaz in trucks. Out of the big three Kamaz are most notable as they have won using the largest variety of vehicles instead of sticking with a select few models. In 2006 a tracked vehicle category was proposed and rejected due to the necessary volume of sub-divisions to ensure fair competition. In 2018 an EV category was proposed, this to was rejected as &quot;there currently exists no electric vehicle capable of crossing the most remote stages of the Dakar unsupported and it would place an unnecessary risk on support crews to enable them to do so&quot;, despite annual reviews and counter-claims this continues to be the case. In 2020 Volkswagen proposed an all-electric entry for the 2021 race and although accepted as a non-competing entry, failed to appear.", "time": 1673222623, "resto": 26238344}, {"no": 26240347, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:12:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can anyone give a quick rundown of the car and truck standings?

When John and Horace Dodge adopted the interlocking-triangle theme for their company logo in 1914, it wasn\u2019t solely regarded as the the symbol of Judaism as it is today. More broadly, it was interpreted simply as a sign of good fortune. In iconography and numerology, the symbol is ancient.

The D and B in the logo are also interlinked, which lends some weight to the theory. (DB symbols can be found on millions of Ford parts manufactured by the Dodge Brothers between 1903 and 1914.)
