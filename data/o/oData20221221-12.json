Extending the shock and the nature of adventure riding will put excessive torsional stress on the current set-up. <br>If I were designing it from the ground up I would have a stiffer aluminium swingarm with dog-bone linkage suspension mounted to the centre of the frame.", "filename": "D9D21962-BC3B-4903-A2A8-7A98216073E8", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2350, "h": 1910, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 101, "tim": 1671598818204254, "time": 1671598818, "md5": "arbV9Z2GE3y2PwYpcAW83g==", "fsize": 470546, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183567, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:04:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26183558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26183558</a><br>Sound like you want a Scrambler 1200", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 533, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671599079079294, "time": 1671599079, "md5": "veiDLtTERmFa+wNqGYMuVg==", "fsize": 893381, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183569, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:05:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "riding snowboard tomorrow. its like a bike with no tires", "time": 1671599109, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183571, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:06:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26183569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26183569</a><br>nothing like a bike and you&#039;re late to the game<br>should have picked up skiing instead", "time": 1671599193, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183572, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:06:47", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_20221221_002811", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671599207736019, "time": 1671599207, "md5": "915byxcxLCnm53zUJWQfnQ==", "fsize": 1247730, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183573, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26183571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26183571</a><br>actually i been snowboard since i was a child, im late to motorcycling", "time": 1671599222, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183575, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:08:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26183573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26183573</a><br>makes sense, snowboardings popularity peaked in the mid 2000s", "time": 1671599330, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26183576, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:09:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26183567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26183567</a><br>I do.

Supercub with a rider dressed as Tanjiro from Demon Slayer. The 2,000 shipyard workers flocking to and from work? Supercubs wearing their matching shipyard safety vests and chainsmoking while riding. <br>The main roads are impeccably maintained but the countryside can get a bit rough, lots of extremely narrow roads and unforseen hairpins, but they usually have a convex (or concave, dunno, failed physics) mirror at the corners so you can see who&#039;s coming.", "time": 1671623144, "resto": 26182719}, {"no": 26184071, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Has anyone bought a bigger motorcycle then realized they missed shifting?

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.

If it&#039;s low miles or otherwise &quot;preserved&quot;, flip it to a boomer and go buy a driver one and pocket the difference. They&#039;re very fun cars and definitely one of the worst to lock up in a garage as a pseudo art piece in this clown market where they sell for double what they&#039;re worth.<br>Assuming it&#039;s not a museum specimen, start modding it. This is your life now. I recommend at least a catback and probably headers. Not sure about the NA2s (assuming yours is one and not a facelifted 95-01), but the 3.0 cars are very quiet from factory and slow anyway, so you might as well wake it up and enjoy one of the better-sounding V6s. If you have the cash for a supercharger kit and can find one, I hear the extra few horses make the car not-slow. Turbos make them actually fast, but good luck finding kits for reasonable money.<br>Also: you should either start hoarding parts or praying for a recession, because everything&#039;s ricetaxed through the roof on these, even stock stuff.

Incredibly simple, yet it works on multiple levels.<br>For one it tests if you have a concept of delayed reward. Reverse parking is slightly more difficult and time consuming than forward parking for a novice. Yet when you come to leave, driving forwards out of a space onto a busy street or parking lot is infinitely easier than backing out and being unable to see what&#039;s coming. The payoff is well worth it.<br>But that&#039;s not all<br>Reverse parking is easier than forward once you practice, but more difficult initially. So it is also a laziness test. Someone who gives no shits about what is better in the long run or improving themselves will always choose the lazy option of badly forward parking because it is &quot;easier and quicker&quot;, and they will spend their entire life doing that.<br>For those that aren&#039;t filtered by the laziness and intelligence test it actually works out even better once you practice due to the way cars turn. While going forwards the rear end follows the front and cuts the corner trailing behind you. You have little control over this. So to forward park properly, you have to swing the front out wide (which you don&#039;t always have room for) so that the rear end can cut the corner and end up in the right place. Most forward parkers are too stupid to realise this, so they end up backing out and in again multiple times or they just leave the car at a stupid angle they initially pulled in at.<br>On the contrary, while going backwards your car becomes rear steering. By thinking ahead you can make very tight turns and still end up placing the rear of the car exactly where it needs to be then correcting the placement of the front of the car in the same motion<br><br>Tl;dr being able to rear-park is a retard test", "time": 1671364524, "resto": 26174170}, {"no": 26176243, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There are a few reasons why backing into a parking space may be considered better than driving into a parking space head-on:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Improved visibility: </span><br>When you reverse park, you have a better view of your surroundings because you are facing the opposite direction.

They tend to put packages together and advertise their package horsepower. They make ok power but never the power that a ported AFR, Brodix, Trick Flow, or others make. For one reason is their port cc size is usually on the smaller side like 180 or 295cc when the others make monster ports of 220-240cc. A 240cc Small block would make great peak power but wouldn\u2019t drive well on the street.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated?

As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door. My hope is that between a coolant system flush, a heater core backflush, a new blend door actuator, and a new blend door heat to the cab can be restored.", "time": 1670472295, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26146386, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)23:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>This has to be a troll.

But I managed to remove the old throttle cables with a combination of ring spanners, poking utensils and what girls refer to as &#039;magic hands&#039;. My original plan to just replace the internal cable was foiled by the damaged English (oxford) and their refusal to include any of the cable ends that LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE JAPANESE BIKE USES in their &quot;universal throttle cable kit&quot;. Luckily I&#039;m God&#039;s favourite NPC so the go to bike bits shop had two (almost) universal throttle cable kits that ( were Japanese and) they sold for the price of one because I was wearing overalls and told them I ride a tiny Honda. I say &#039;almost universal because while my throttle housing had one M8\u00d71.25 thread that fitted perfectly the throttle return is a M10\u00d7 1.25 thread, I figured out I could just drill and tap the end of the old cable. However the only way to buy a M10\u00d71.25 tap on a Sunday is as part of a 40 piece tap and die set at any given hardware store.<br>But after all of this and some more &#039;Magic hands&#039; I have a fully functioning bike with zero throttle slack.

The 12V stubby is like a replacement for a 1/2\u201d ratchet, it\u2019s not going to do anything you can\u2019t do by hand. There\u2019s a huge difference in power if you get down on some of the mid torque 18V 1/2\u201d guns and they\u2019re only a couple inches long. Plus a compact 18V isn\u2019t much larger than the 12V tools and you can use the $100 batteries on tons of other useful tools.<br><br>Also as far as stubby impacts, they\u2019re not that powerful overall, and 90% of the jobs you would grab the stubby for, you could use a 1/4\u201d impact driver with a socket adapter and get the same results. So if you\u2019re just buying into a cordless platform, skip the 12V stubby and check out something like the DeWalt 20V Atomic drill and impact driver kit, they\u2019re real affordable when they go on sale. Then save up and get DeWalt\u2019s newest 20V XR 1/2\u201d mid torque, it\u2019s a beast for the size and you won\u2019t even need a high torque for all but the most stubborn rusted shit.

All it does is makes it natural to plot the two curves against each other for the range of a typical automotive gasoline engine at the time the convention was established.<br><br>Don&#039;t drop out of high school next time.", "time": 1671516273, "resto": 26173437}, {"no": 26180979, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)01:11:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26180972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26180972</a><br>Ok fucks it got to do with the Richter scale?", "time": 1671516695, "resto": 26173437}, {"no": 26181001, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)01:24:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26180979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26180979</a><br>You&#039;d have to ask him, but I suspect he&#039;s talking about logarithmic scales like Richter. In a typical traditional engine setup where maybe care about some kind of racing application where acceleration is really the important thing, then neither torque nor horsepower tells you how fast the engine is going to be able to keep turning faster and faster, let alone how that affects the vehicle&#039;s ability to go faster and faster depending on gearing and what range of road speeds you might care about.<br><br>But, as a bit of aphoristic wisdom, it is true that you might hope you can keep the engine engine somewhere in the &quot;power band&quot; (i.e. hoursepower) if you want to maintain a high degree of acceleration or at least high speed where more power is needed to overcome fictional losses like wind resistance the rest. Whereas torque is often the more informative thing when it counts for truck or tractor action where you want to be able to begin acceleration from a lower RPM by being able to impel a lot of force on the drive line to get the vehicle up to speed speed where you&#039;re better able to expend the total work output (power output) capacity of the engine. It&#039;s a bit of a difficult subject if you you&#039;re not a math nerd, but I suspect that he&#039;s making a reasonably correct analogy that torque tells you more about a categorically lower RPM (think a diesel engine that doesn&#039;t typically spin all that fast) vs. a categorically higher RPM (think a gasoline engine where the lighter and faster-burning fuel will tend to expend more of its energy at higher piston speeds.)

Just running a voltage through a coil and then disconnecting will technically build a substantial transient voltage, but it&#039;ll be short and weak compared to how much energy builds up in a resonant circuit, and how long the spark will last since it takes a short but important amount of time for it to loose all of its resonance by continuing to pulse the spark plug.<br><br>But yeah try a new module if it&#039;s not expensive.

Obviously you have to get used to the extra weight and the concept of keeping steady wrist position with your right hand when turning, etc., but beyond that for all beginner low speed stuff it&#039;s just a heavy motorized bicycle. Once you go faster around 20-30 mph then you will need to be more conscious of counter steering (literally turn the bars the opposite of where you want to lean, turn the bars to the right slightly to lean left, etc). It&#039;s the same on a bicycle, but few people go fast enough to really get a feel for it. Just remember to play with turning the bars the first few times you go faster on a motorcycle and it will make sense immediately. Make sure to also study the physics of riding from Mike on Bikes and Yamaha Champion School so you don&#039;t do dumb things out of fear or misinformation like only using the rear brake or thinking you can&#039;t brake during a turn, etc. I&#039;d estimate probably 95% of motorcycle riders actually do not use proper techniques because they literally don&#039;t understand the physics of it and their lack of knowledge won&#039;t show until an emergency situation comes up and they &quot;hadda layer down&quot; because they don&#039;t know shit about handling.", "time": 1671563577, "resto": 26180171}, {"no": 26182253, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)14:14:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26180450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26180450</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;motorcycles steer, lean and brake differently from bicycles</span><br><br>Literally 100% false.

You know how in movies most of the important characters are attractive? Good-looking people exist in real life too, but you&#039;re unlikely to find such a concentration of beautiful people in real life as you do in Hollywood movies. It&#039;s kind of like that with the cars in those movies. Yes, you could see cars on the street like the ones in the movies, but it would be unusual to see so many that take it quite so far as the ones in the movies. For what it&#039;s worth, I consider that style to be more of a 90&#039;s thing than an early 00&#039;s thing, by the way. By the early 00&#039;s, it was already on the way out, and the dotcom crash / small recession around 2002 killed it in the US, imo. For a positive portrayal of that scene, visit your local library and see if they have old copies of Sports Compact Car magazine from the late 90&#039;s.
