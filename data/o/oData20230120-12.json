Country is divided in 16 of these, but law is the same everywhere, as Poland is a republic and there is central government in Warsaw) police station. You leave your application there and after few days you can expect background check. Local policeman visits you at home. Will make an interview with you, your family and neighbours (won&#039;t reveal purpose though) and will check history of your crimes (which has to be zero xD).<br>Once he&#039;s done with his paperwork, you will finally get your weapon permit. When you complete this path they cannot deny you. Police gives you certain number of certificates which allow you to buy gun. You can apply for 5, 10, 15 whatever. They usually suggest you how many is best, it depends on the chief of police, how many he&#039;s willing to give at beginning. Those certificates are only way to buy a firearm. Every seller will need them from you, as he has to inform police about selling his gun and return this certificate to the police. You also have to register your weapon within 5 working days since you buy it. It will be noted, with serial number, in a little red book (picrel), that certifies you&#039;re a legal gun owner. You have to carry this book on you anytime you got your weapon with you.<br>Ah... don&#039;t forget to buy safe! It needs to be certified steel safe where weapons and ammo will be kept at all times. Nobody else but permit holder can have keys or combination to it.<br>Important: Whenever you use all your certificates, you can apply for more and you will get them. Your local policeman will come again, check whether all registered gun are still in your posession (better be ;), storage conditions are correct and you&#039;re not beating your wife ;) There are no limits in number of guns.

GM V6 engines are solid like the LFX and LGX. Shouldn&#039;t have any reliability issues. Ford gave V6 engines a bad name unfortunately with their trash V6 engines that they had to scrap them and no longer make any V6 Mustangs. Chevy however uses V6 engines all across their lineup. Then you have the manual transmissions for the Mustang which have been notoriously bad that people recommend the 10 speed auto which is actually a good transmission Ford uses. In your case you want manual so again it&#039;s better to stick with the Cammy Whammy. The V6 makes more horsepower than the Ecoboost and since you&#039;ve found it powerful already no point in downgrading to a more stressed out smaller turbocharged engine. Ecoboost also sounds like dogshit compared to the V6. You won&#039;t get around the fact that it sounds distinctly like a 4 cylinder engine which it is compared to the more muscular sounding V6 engine. Camaro is on the outstanding Alpha Platform chassis too. I&#039;d say trust your gut and go for the Camaro and don&#039;t get dissuaded, there&#039;s a reason why you were thinking of going with the Camaro and you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br><br>Here is a LFX swapped Miata doing the burgerking<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eiJ8p<wbr>LIZnJs<br><br>Sound<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8A-7b<wbr>Bn2GKU<br><br>POV drive<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fTRP<wbr>dJkdp4", "time": 1674024037, "resto": 26266775}, {"no": 26271424, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)07:04:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The 4cyl camero is better than the ecoboost as a track car but worse at being just a regular comfy car with good visibility.

The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

Place the boards in their fully deployed position. In most cases, it may be easier to remove the motors from the motor linkages to allow the steps to fully deploy, and proceed with the rest of the process.<br>2. Verify that the pinch weld holes are lining up with the holes for the linkages. You may need to enlarge the holes in the pinch weld if they do not line up or are catching the bolt threads as you install the steps.<br>3. Verify that the rear of the running board is flush with the rear linkage. If it is not, adjust the running board forward so that the end cap is flush with the linkage.<br>4. Make sure that ALL HARDWARE IS TIGHTENED PROPERLY.<br>5. Have someone walk the length of the board, taking bouncing steps or shifting their weight up and down as they walk. DO NOT JUMP on the running boards. Only shift your weight up and down while moving the entire length of the running board, like you are performing a suspension check.<br>6. With the boards still in the down position, loosen the button head Torx head bolts that go through the pinch weld. DO NOT loosen the hex head bolts on the back of the rocker panel. Then, either have someone sit on the center of the board or put some weight on the center of the board. While there is weight on the board, retighten the button head bolts going through the pinch weld.<br>7.

Americans would rather pay twice as much for a bigger vehicle. Rangers are smaller than their wife&#039;s Explorer, only poorfags bought them and companies moved to Transits for fleet vehicles. Eurovans won in this case.<br><br>2. Because Americans want big trucks. For all the bloated dimensions today, most of it is cosmetic. My &#039;85 F-series is a fucking road hog and it doesn&#039;t even have duallies. It&#039;s also hard to control and slides everywhere if you&#039;re not careful shifting. Which speaks to how much better truck transmissions are now and how ECS/ABS has made truck driving easy enough for the layman.<br><br>3. Kei trucks don&#039;t pass emissions or crash testing laws, so they&#039;re defacto banned on that basis alone. American road laws do not consistently make categories for &quot;low speed&quot; vehicles or very small utility vehicles as Japan does. Just in general, Americans want a vehicle that can reliably go on a highway. 4-cyl Rangers have a hard enough time making it to 55 under load, let alone a normal freeway speed at 75. Most people would rather get a bigger truck in this case. Additionally, cabover trucks that do fit all this are much bigger and already sold by Isuzu, often with a full size cargo van and a liftgate.<br><br>4. Americans are fat and have been getting fatter. This is an actual problem, Californians might be able to fit into a Ranger without trouble but when most of your buyers are from Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois your little truck won&#039;t be able to fit one of them let alone two.

I have big mechanic sausage fingers and it makes removing the belt sprocket bolt annoying.<br><br>Oh yeah and to explain to those who don&#039;t know the 2.0 thermostat/coolant pump:<br>It&#039;s a mostly plastic body with a metal pump bolted to it on the transmission side - the pump being driven by a tiny timing belt off the balance shaft which sticks out towards the rear of the engine for this purpose. I&#039;ve never seen a pump go bad but everyone I&#039;ve seen has codes for the thermostat (either sensor or actuator).

Muttcars usually have terrible gas mileage and their parts are scarce and expensive compared to other brands.

Generally, avoid mercedes and bmw if you care about reliability and don&#039;t want to fix electronics every single month. Audi is alright, though once sonething breaks it&#039;s a bit expensive to fix if you&#039;re not doing it yourself; it still is the car that fits your criteria the most though, might want to check the A3. A good all-rounder is <a href=\"#p26271466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26271466</a>, I own one myself and besides regular maintenance nothing needed change after 300k km. If something happens to break, parts are cheap as fuck since it&#039;s all local. It is less luxurious than the audi, but much cheaper too.<br>If for whatever reason vw is not for you, look to the east. Toyota &amp; Honda are the go to if you want reliability, otherwise check out Kia and Hyundai, they have some good shitboxes like the i30 or the veloster for under 10k used. Don&#039;t fall for the Saab meme, it&#039;s a dead company with expensive parts. As for the market, it depends on your country.
