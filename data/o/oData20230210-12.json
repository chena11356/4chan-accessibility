I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support.

A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers. They also outsource the printing like many other vendors (including me), so there&#039;s always going to be blems unless you&#039;re the one handling production or paying them enough money to give enough of a shit.", "time": 1675752309, "resto": 26329663, "trip": "!!VDR3ijdJ5Rz"}, {"no": 26336242, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26336014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26336014</a><br>Idgaf i would rather EVERYONE on the page and just notes or whatever, even if they are outright scams.

I&#039;m debating what was the reasonable thing to do.<br><br>To many, the Mini driver was an asshole for slamming the brakes too early on Yellow, and many drivers would not expect that to happen. This will only be an annoyance if you didn&#039;t tailgate and had enough time to stop or change lanes (our situation with the SUV), or absolutely dangerous if the driver behind was tailgating and had no time to brake or switch lanes.<br><br>Meanwhile, the trucks didn&#039;t do anything illegal, probably, but the front truck made a needlessly wide turn in the middle lane when the turn could have been done no problem completely on the right lane. In addition, the pole was blocked from the view of the SUV driver, so the SUV driver made the most likely and reasonable assumption that the front truck driver wasn&#039;t doing something stupid in the middle lane. In the perspective of the SUV driver, the middle lane was clear.<br><br>Also the SUV driver was already well in front of the chase vehicle that was already almost in the right lane, so why would anyone assume that the front truck was still hugging the middle lane.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost.

the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

There could&#039;ve been a few more tuners, but it was &#039;DUB Edition&#039; and going more for that blingy theme. V8 Dodge Chargers and Lotus Esprits are definitely not tuners by any means however.<br>The Tokyo setting was also added as an afterthought in Remix and it itself was a rehash of the Tokyo map in MC2, though I found it rather disappointing that you don&#039;t even win any Japanese cars there outside of the Nissan concept car (and the Infiniti G35 technically, though it&#039;s in USDM form)<br>The customization is still top tier, however.

Look up ACTK-fr - I recommend them as the go-to for cars in general since they don&#039;t just collect and reupload them, but add LODs and fix some issues here and there, making them immediately better than what a lot of the original authors post since they can&#039;t bother to optimize their shit, specifically all the asshats that just try to sell their garbage on Patreon, not that there aren&#039;t good (free) car mods to be had on there and other similar sites. There are plenty of street cars and tracks on RaceDepartment, if you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for on either of those sites, look up Totsugeki - mostly Japanese cars and better presentation of what to expect. Assettoland would probably be the next place to check, though IMO it&#039;s kind of a disorganized clusterfuck after it got shutdown like three times for sharing payware cars. As for people on Patreon: Dan Bucsa, MacedoSTI, VR driving, Jerry Wei/\u4f2f\u745c \u9b4f, DanielDi, Just Kapi, etc. You can find a bunch of cars and shit searching on jewtube too. I&#039;d say don&#039;t bother with the Cut Up No Hesi servers unless you really want a specific car and have space, most of the cars in their packs are half-baked garbage, though their traffic pack I would say is the gold standard. Freeroam maps and driving with traffic? Search YouTube. There&#039;s a bunch now, though the best ones that I&#039;ve tried are LA Canyons, Pacific Coast Highway, Union Island, High Force, and Shutoko Revival Project. You&#039;ll have to get into discord servers to get download links to a lot of content too. Touge Union and Kami Trick have some nice content floating around. Currently 2REAL is the best traffic simulation but it&#039;s singleplayer only. If you want to do multiplayer with friends with AI traffic, look up Assetto Server.

I got caltrops from amazon, paid quite a lot for the hollow ones, got 80 of them. These kids with their loud ass ktms and other child bikes ride around my home. I got fed up with it and since they aren&#039;t local I can&#039;t just ask their parents to take care of them. I tried asking my neighbors if they knew the kids but apparently nobody does. So my plan was clear, the road up to my house is an uphill and it immediately turns downhill. You can use it as a huge ramp if you wanted to, these kids sometimes do, they get decent air time. But they cannot see anything until the hill starts going down, so it&#039;s blind to them. I told the neighbors on friday of that week to avoid the certain spot I placed the caltrops and everyone was with me on this. Lo and behold 2AM on a friday night the kids come again with their obnoxious bike (I have a motorcycle too but it&#039;s a real motorcycle) and sure enough once they go past the hill they hit the caltrops and I know they stopped almost instantly because you can hear those bikes a long long way from you. cops were called, everyone was interviewed, me included, but nobody ratted me out and I just played dumb. they didn&#039;t pursue the matter further because nobody broke a bone or anything. the bikes were not able to continue back so they left them to the side of the street over the night and I still regret not putting a note on them saying something like &quot;next time consider not bringing your noisy bikes here&quot; but I thought I&#039;d let it slide, they learned their lesson and I didn&#039;t want to get any more attention from the cops. because I live in finland I can&#039;t disclose the location, I don&#039;t want people connecting dots. some read about it on iltalehti or ilta sanomat, there was an news story about it there<br><br>I just can&#039;t say I regret a thing. I was so fed up with them at the point that I didn&#039;t care if some bones were broken. I didn&#039;t want them to die but you can hardly die by riding into amazon caltrops.", "filename": "frog crush", "ext": ".png", "w": 1144, "h": 888, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1675968394382873, "time": 1675968394, "md5": "vkFoh6VYc2561eazIru7uw==", "fsize": 344886, "resto": 26342818, "trip": "!!1w3SeuwCso0"}, {"no": 26343109, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:47:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26342818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26342818</a><br>Because that&#039;s illegal, chud", "time": 1675968460, "resto": 26342818}, {"no": 26343113, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:49:05", "name": "Vtak yo", "com": "<a href=\"#p26342990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26342990</a><br>I don&#039;t really give a shit either way but I put the blue line police sponsor plate on my wrx and now I get away with all kinds of shit I shouldn&#039;t", "time": 1675968545, "resto": 26342818, "trip": "!EGW8pzdbCs"}, {"no": 26343117, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:52:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26343079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26343079</a><br>So then you should probably kill yourself.<br><a href=\"#p26343113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26343113</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;using a dogwhistle to your advantage</span><br>based and redpilled", "time": 1675968741, "resto": 26342818}, {"no": 26343120, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:53:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26342990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26342990</a><br>im a cop lmao and i&#039;ve actually been thinking about trying to create gadgets to install on my personal car because larping as a spy is fun and free men don&#039;t ask permission. so far I&#039;ve got:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; device to scatter caltrops</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; smokescreen (probably some sort of rigged up fire extinguisher)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; oil slick</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; an array of strong lasers facing backwards out of my rear windshield to blind pursuers</span>", "time": 1675968803, "resto": 26342818}, {"no": 26343123, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:55:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26343107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26343107</a><br>based.

Couple that with poor storage techniques of their primary weapons (AIM-7 Sparrow missiles) which led to degradation of the electronics and you have a recipe for disaster.

I hated the one I drove and, again, legroom was an issue in the older models. The older cars also have a reputation of falling off the road backwards in a vicious manner if you&#039;re forced to lift off mid-bend - this tendency has been tamed in the later models by the chassis magicians in Weissach, to the point where they now defy physics - although it&#039;s instructive that they moved the engine in front of the gearbox for the 917, and for the racing 911s. I can drive a modern 911 and contemplated one, but the noise from the rear in the cabin on long journeys would have got wearing, so I passed and bought something else.<br>A 30-yo Ferrari would definitely be fragile, as I said.

You used to have to have a manual transmission and actually be able to launch and shift. If you showed up with an automatic you were dead in the water unless you massively outclassed the other car in horsepower. Nowadays you just ask the computer to make you go fast and stomp the gas pedal and that&#039;s it and getting a real manual makes you slower.<br><br>-Cheap used cars that were possible to build into something worthwhile got all wrecked and prices shot up. Too few new entry-level sports cars were made to replace them and now we have the situation of today.
