People dislike this version of Celica in particular because it detracted so much from the previous Celicas it gained the name from.

They were more trying to gain the Honda Civic audience but failed to do so properly. When you modify this generation of Celica, you can have a decent peppy, track machine of sort. Many aftermarket parts available to tune it to your liking. But there were just so many better Japanese platforms out there and not to mention the European scene at the time as well as American machines of the early-2000&#039;s.

Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

It&#039;s about $38k USD in Japan and it comes with high ground clearance, Mitsu renowned AWC, and a fuck ton of all terrain accessories and amenities. <br><br>Of course Mitsubishi gives no shits about selling in the North American market it seems like these days, so we get none of their cool shit. No Delica diesel AWC, no Grand Lancer, no Pajero, no Shogun, no Xpander, we do get the based shitbox Mirage though, that&#039;s not bad.", "filename": "download (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 396, "h":

Even for handling the Japanese flagships were often boats full of unnecessary bullshit so handling is nothing special, either. The American cars also tend to have pretty comfy roomy engine bays vs. god awfully tight JDM engine bays on everything but front engine 4 cylinders. I can&#039;t believe how comparatively easy it is to get around a C5 or New Edge Mustang engine bay compared to most JDM cars.<br><br>I&#039;m over it, personally. I only liked Japanese cars because everyone told me they were reliable and American cars weren&#039;t, but I&#039;m quickly learning that all of that was outdated 30 years ago and they&#039;re fine if you remotely maintain them. Any real world reliability differences come down more to negligent owners that bought the American car because it was the cheapest in its class and never spent a penny on maintenance and ragged the hell out of it while some Corolla buyer went to every maintenance interval and never took it past 2/3 of the rev range.", "time": 1675301213, "resto": 26319019}, {"no": 26319196, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26319019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26319019</a><br>The biggest blind spot I see consistently is the effect of regulations and taxes on vehicle design. People assume that a Japanese (or Euro) sports car that competes with an American car should basically have the same performance and qualities, as they are competitors. In reality, Japanese and Euro brands CAN&#039;T compete with American sports cars because they are born from an entirely different legal world. Japs and Euros face stiff taxes on displacement and in some cases outright bans due to emissions bullshit. This means you either literally CAN&#039;T make a V8 car or if you do it has to be so expensive due to taxes/fees that it is a luxury car by default. Consider a Mustang GT which in Netherlands costs something like $80k... if you&#039;re going to spend $80k on a car most people would rather pay $100k and have a non-dogshit interior, whereas adding that additional $20k in price to an American mustang (going from $40k to $60k) is a much different proposition. However, the other thing people don&#039;t realize is that comparing 0-60 times and such as if faster always means better is the definition of bench racing.

IMO the A4/S4 is better than the S3/A3. The Quattro system in the A4 (ultra) and the S4 (crown/torsen) is worth paying for. <br><br>Quattro ultra has the detached rear axle when you don\u2019t need awd. Audi noticed it\u2019s A4/Q5 customers were thinking in terms of \u2018gee AWD uses more gas so maybe I\u2019ll get FWD and stay home if it snows\u2019 instead of thinking about sporty ness. Since torsen uses .6L of fuel extra per 60km Quattro ultra uses .2L and so it offers the best of both worlds for customers that were torn on Quattro. It\u2019s also exoerimxe better than torsen in the snow/ice as ids faster to get torque where it needs to go. <br>Haldex sucks bad. The engine is all forward of the front axle. It barely sends power rear except in extreme situations and the worst part is it breaks in as little as 10k miles. The A4 ultra is fwd biased like Haldex but the weight is minimal, the engine is mroe rear, the system is much more siphsitaced in terms of engaging the clutch and it\u2019s much more robust and has no issues with reliability. <br><br>The nice thing about the A4 is the current 4 cylinder is very reliable and the water pump meme is covered by a recall. I doubt you have warranty issues to worry about. Since Audi puts engines on the front axle a 4 cylinder is ideal because it\u2019s compact and weighs little so the A4 has a good argument for handling the best. <br>Order an 034 Motorsport rear sway bar and you\u201dll have a very neutral handling car with great awd and a DCT.", "time": 1675352920, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320963, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:54:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320947</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a tuned S6 running bunkers numbers and fully modified suspension and my dealer loves the car and always run my warranty</span><br>just to clarify, you have an S6 that you&#039;ve tuned extensively, broke something in your drivetrain, and they warrantied those repairs? what kind of powertrain repairs did they perform under warranty with your tune?", "time": 1675353258, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320970, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320813</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no r8 for me then</span><br><br>imagine my reaction when i found out the hard way", "filename": "dont", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 231, "h": 218, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1675353346580871, "time": 1675353346, "md5": "7ymVmCpXCYP2C1Vm5r2zNg==", "fsize": 5681, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320973, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320963</a><br>The S3 they replaced the Haldex and rear bumper.

Chevy is up there with Nissan, as far as shitty jatco cvt 7 programming. I&#039;d recommend a manual Spark and forgo the cvt 7 version, as there is a substantial online presence of owners complaining about cvt failure, often just out of warranty. Which is a paltry 5 years or 60k miles. I&#039;d look at the Mitsubishi Mirage aka Space Star aka Dodge Attitude first. It too has the cvt 7 but has a much better track record, with a fuck ton of solid data to back this up on mirage forum, arguably the most helpful and prompt advice giving, auto forum. <br><br>If its gotta be a Spark though and you can&#039;t find a manual version, then try to find one under 30k miles and then immediately do an oem cvt fluid change and continue to do that every 30k miles and also changing the side cartridge cvt filter every 60k miles. <br><br>The easiest way to access that filter is taking your front tire off and unbolting the inside wheel well plastic, I think its got 4x 10mm screws total? Don&#039;t quote me on that but do quote me on it being extremely easy. Might take you 30 mins tops to service your cvt with a drain and fill/filter change. All you need is your tire jack and a pan to do this. Only use Mitsubishi oem cvt fluid and its pricey too but better quality than Nissan&#039;s orange piss cvt fluid. Genuine Mitsubishi OE CVT Transmission J4 Fluid MZ320185 is about fifty bucks for three quarts. <br><br>There are many advantages though to owning a Spark vs a Mirage. It&#039;s faster with more HP, parts are very cheap even oem, Chevy dealer network is massive. Mitsubishi North American network is tiny in comparison but growing. <br><br>Mirage gets better mpg, has a lot more cargo volume room, is more comfortable for back seat passengers, especially the G4 sedan Mirage, that has more rear passenger legroom than an Altima. Look it up. Mirage is also IMO more reliable than the Spark.", "time": 1675546437, "resto": 26327123}, {"no": 26327862, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:39:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26327123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26327123</a><br>It will let you down when you do need it as a backup.", "time": 1675546743, "resto": 26327123}, {"no": 26327897, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:55:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "it&#039;s a good car for $500", "time": 1675547721, "resto": 26327123}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26280610, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:47:02", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "What&#039;s your dumb project car idea?", "com": "E.g. buying a salvage ferrari, or trying to recreate a concept car", "filename": "corvette go cart", "ext": ".png", "w": 748, "h": 560, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674301622656571, "time": 1674301622, "md5": "D7I1+LHcAekbZ0H8cTL8CQ==", "fsize": 973455, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-your-dumb-project-car-idea", "replies": 237, "images": 90, "unique_ips": 170}, {"no": 26280612, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:47:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280610</a><br>Turbo tesla", "time": 1674301662, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280616, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:49:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280612</a><br>There is a model S that&#039;s been LS swapped, I believe.", "time": 1674301786, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280620, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:52:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Going turbo mad max autismo and pick up anything on its last legs and modifiy it with junk parts then put new junk parts in when it breaks", "filename": "5-55041d5a2e463", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 639, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674301928735294, "time": 1674301928, "md5": "sa2i/6dUJN7BtxUN7G7/5Q==", "fsize": 82117, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280623, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:53:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "test", "time": 1674301994, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280626, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:54:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280616</a><br>No I mean keeping the EV motors though", "time": 1674302079, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280629, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)06:55:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280616</a><br>And one that is cummins swapped and on a lifted trugg chassis with dually tires<br><br>Mine is maybe EV swap this thing in the end as I&#039;m just about done trying to keep the original engine together, so is the engine.", "filename": "IMG_20230102_154929_HDR", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 1800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 56, "tim": 1674302133244837, "time": 1674302133, "md5": "OI9Zbz16Bft5maGy+6GMZw==", "fsize": 1940400, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280695, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:23:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280612</a><br><a href=\"#p26280616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280616</a><br>Not only one. <br>Since the EV experiment failed people are recycling the defunct EV appliances.", "filename": "tesla-model-s-fitted-with-chevrolet-ls3-v8-engine", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674303806296598, "time": 1674303806, "md5": "rDGmxo82+ZrStZFr/hCoug==", "fsize": 156998, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280727, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:48:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280610</a><br>Opel Manta B with a Audi inline 5 swap (actually planning that one)<br>Drag car out of a 50&#039;s abandoned rustbucket<br>Generally saving abandoned cars", "time": 1674305312, "resto": 26280610}, {"no": 26280729, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:54:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26280695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26280695</a><br>Why do retards always post this picture?

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

sailboat has an electric furler for the head sail and electric foghorns and a radar unit which means it probably also has an integral autopilot and electric winches for the lines and any number of other parts that can (and with boats that means will) get fucked to death in any number of ways and leave you stranded if you can&#039;t jury rig them and then handle your jank jury rig. You&#039;ll be lucky if the manual tiller isn&#039;t a tiny piece of crap hidden under a seat in the cockpit for emergencies only. It probably has a swing keel too, so it can be nice and fat above the waterline but still actually make it to a dock because there&#039;s no way the rich boomer demographic for one of those pieces of crap will lower a skiff in to the water and get in it.<br>PS that bow shape is awful for a cruising boat, literally a boat to take pretty pictures and go sailing for a day because it was your lifelong dream and then you let it rot at the dock. You wouldn&#039;t wanna sleep in that thing, a curved bow like that makes every wave lift it 3 or 4 feet in the air before it slams back down.", "time": 1675483132, "resto": 26321565}, {"no": 26326084, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)00:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325918</a><br>Bro, the boat literally doesn&#039;t have wiring. I know, I ripped all of it out. The boat is from 1959, and had a major (shitty) refit done in 1989 by an idiot who used clear silicone. Windlass is manual, furler is manual, fucker doesn&#039;t even have an engine.

The shape keeps you from plowing into the waves and foundering. Straight bows like to smash, and inverted bows like to dig into waves and sink. I&#039;ll give you that the waterline at rest is suboptimal, but guess what? It&quot;s a *sailboat,* it heels and the waterline magically grows! It&#039;s how this specific boat won the New York to Bermuda race.<br><br>Also, the waterline grows as you weigh it down. Fully loaded, the boat is 31ft at the waterline on a 37ft hull.
