I have seen a diagram of a slightly different looking canister which shows that the small diameter vacuum hose controls a valve which allows vapor to be sucked through the larger hose out of the canister into the TB. I have also conversely read on a forum that the small hose is for idling, and the larger for open throttle, which makes no sense to me. If the first explanation is correct, i don&#039;t understand why, when you drive the car immediately after starting it (before the 02 sensors are heated up enough for the fuel system to be in closed loop control mode), the car drives perfectly fine, when by this explanation it should be getting extra fuel that is unaccounted for from the evap canister when vacuum opens that valve. I think i may be not fully understanding how the car manages fuel trim?

IMO the A4/S4 is better than the S3/A3. The Quattro system in the A4 (ultra) and the S4 (crown/torsen) is worth paying for. <br><br>Quattro ultra has the detached rear axle when you don\u2019t need awd. Audi noticed it\u2019s A4/Q5 customers were thinking in terms of \u2018gee AWD uses more gas so maybe I\u2019ll get FWD and stay home if it snows\u2019 instead of thinking about sporty ness. Since torsen uses .6L of fuel extra per 60km Quattro ultra uses .2L and so it offers the best of both worlds for customers that were torn on Quattro. It\u2019s also exoerimxe better than torsen in the snow/ice as ids faster to get torque where it needs to go. <br>Haldex sucks bad. The engine is all forward of the front axle. It barely sends power rear except in extreme situations and the worst part is it breaks in as little as 10k miles. The A4 ultra is fwd biased like Haldex but the weight is minimal, the engine is mroe rear, the system is much more siphsitaced in terms of engaging the clutch and it\u2019s much more robust and has no issues with reliability. <br><br>The nice thing about the A4 is the current 4 cylinder is very reliable and the water pump meme is covered by a recall.

People assume that a Japanese (or Euro) sports car that competes with an American car should basically have the same performance and qualities, as they are competitors.

Japs and Euros face stiff taxes on displacement and in some cases outright bans due to emissions bullshit.

Consider a Mustang GT which in Netherlands costs something like $80k... if you&#039;re going to spend $80k on a car most people would rather pay $100k and have a non-dogshit interior, whereas adding that additional $20k in price to an American mustang (going from $40k to $60k) is a much different proposition.

The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost.

It&#039;s a potentiometer like the TPS and reports with a low voltage when the valve is closed and increasing as the valve opens. The problem here is the system duty cycles the EGR solenoid (black cylindrical thing to the left rear of EGR valve) to open the valve which results in a constant slight pulsing of the EGR diaphragm.

There&#039;s also a misconception that the engine makes a physical connection to the wheels at 70 MPH. This is also false. The engine makes a physical connection to the wheels whenever the vehicle deems it&#039;s more efficient. This includes high load scenarios like accelerating and cruising at high speed, though there&#039;s no strict speed at which this occurs.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and you can feel it and then when the gas motor kicks in it&#039;s BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR and vibrates the whole car like a lawn mower.</span><br>Yes, the engine can still be heard and felt, but unlike a typical gas car, the engine is run far less (in some cases up to 90% less), resulting in a smoother and quieter experience for the rest of the time while driving on electricity.", "time": 1675199121, "resto": 26309202}, {"no": 26314628, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:14:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26314270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26314270</a><br>Even if you did use some gas miles every time you drove, you&#039;d still be at a net savings over a Prius for a relatively long distance.
