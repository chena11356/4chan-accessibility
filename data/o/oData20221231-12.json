BUT the compass &quot;trailhawk&quot; was the biggest peice of shit. The brand new engine burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which I only found out because one day driving down the highway my engine shuts off at 60 mph after a &quot;low oil pressure&quot; warning flashed up for 5 seconds. This happened the first time aound 10k miles. And several times after that despite me pouring a fresh quart in once a month. I was then told that the oil consumption rate was normal by the dealership. Aside from that I had shit break on it constantly. Half the parts are from a fiat 500 and it&#039;s 4wd is actually just AWD. The final nail in the coffin was when my battery died, but it wasn&#039;t actually my battery. It was a very small sub battery that sat on top of my normal battery that INDEPENDENTLY powered the starter motor. So I had a totally fine battery, but because some AA Duracell shit was dead the fucking car wouldn&#039;t start.

The lawyer wouldn&#039;t give me a number after me repeating the question 3 times. She only gave an example of a similar case she did; hit and run, but with no real damage and the victim asked for 10k. At fault driver refused the amount and decided to go to court to take the fine and community service verdict. Sounds like a bullshit story though.<br>The lawyer didn&#039;t seem particularly enthusiastic when I spoke to her. Seems like she just wanted a number so she can tell me whether or not her client can afford it. I told her I&#039;ll get back to her next week after I crunch some numbers. Since the max penalty is going to be 6, 250 anyway, I was thinking it&#039;s fair to offer something around or below that as long as I can show proof (I don&#039;t think I have to though, since it&#039;s a settlement). We get nothing if it goes to court, since we aren&#039;t suing, we&#039;re just pressing charges. I honestly don&#039;t know how all this works legally, but I believe if we don&#039;t settle to drop the charges, she just goes to trial with us only showing up as witnesses. Most likely she&#039;ll be convicted, since the evidence and is pretty air tight. Like I said though, at first we just wanted this to play out in court, but if the money is right and is similar to whatever punishment the court might dole out, then sure I&#039;ll take it.<br>As for the at fault driver being a lady. The car is under both my name and my sister&#039;s name, and the cop actually wrote my sister down as the victim (as she is the primary driver) and she was the one who got the court summons.

You mostly change your driving style to compensate so people dont honk at you.

A total basketcase 4cyl nonturbo with broken automatic may take 30-40s to reach 60mph if it does get there. With properly tuned motor and transmission you can floor it, spool boost, and keep up with modern econoboxes and usually pass traffic.

He had always been a bit of a car enthusiast, but he had never really committed to a particular make or model.<br><br>So he started looking around, checking out different dealerships and test-driving a wide variety of cars. He was trying to find the one that felt just right, the one that would suit his needs and his personality.<br><br>As he shopped around, John noticed that there seemed to be a lot of Japanese cars on the market. There were sleek sports cars from Toyota and Honda, rugged SUVs from Nissan and Subaru, and even luxury sedans from Lexus and Acura.<br><br>John was tempted to give these cars a try. They seemed reliable and well-made, and they had a reputation for being fun to drive. But then he heard a rumor that made him think twice.<br><br>Apparently, people were saying that if you drove a Japanese car, it meant that you were homosexual. John didn&#039;t know if this was true or not, but he didn&#039;t want to take any chances. He wasn&#039;t sure how he felt about his own sexuality, and he didn&#039;t want to imply anything that might be untrue.<br><br>So John decided to steer clear of Japanese cars. He wasn&#039;t sure if he was making the right choice, but he figured it was better to be safe than sorry.

He made a vow to do his part to shed light on the issue and push for greater transparency and innovation in the automotive industry. The prime example of this being the new Toyota Supra, which was actually developed in collaboration with BMW and uses a BMW engine. To continue on this; it is essentially a rebranded BMW Z4. Icing on the cake is that BMW didn&#039;t even allow Toyota to use the S55 engine in their &quot;halo performance car&quot;, and instead gave them the B58.

We again got the FQ models in the UK and those were modified by WRC Developments and Ecutek in New Zealand because by that point Ralliart UK no longer existed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The work is extensive and involves the expertise of Ralliart UK, Rampage Performance Motorparts, who source the engine components and put the FQ-400s together, Flow Race Engines, who build the engines, and Owen Developments, the tuner behind the other FQ upgrades, who specified the new turbo and designed a cast stainless steel exhaust manifold. Little of the FQ-320&#039;s engine remains; the cylinder block is a high-strength HKS design, as are the big- end bolts and forged con rods, which are topped by Omega forged pistons. Then there&#039;s the bespoke Garrett turbo and exhaust manifold, and a Janspeed sports catalyst. Fuel and ignition are controlled by a precision Motec management system that also has a data-logging facility, and there are HKS iridium spark plugs and a high-pressure fuel pump. There&#039;s a much tougher clutch, too. The headline 405bhp at 6400rpm is backed up by peak torque of 355lb ft at 5500rpm.</span><br><br>If the 4G63 could make 500+ on stock internals Mitsubishi would have done it and saved themselves the hassle with the FQ cars.", "time": 1672481011, "resto": 26205101}, {"no": 26211331, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:27:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26211303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26211303</a><br>This. People running high horse power on stock 4G63s and 4B11s are usually well under 400lbft of torque if they want longevity. The problem is what they were tuned at in their respective markets. In the UK the FQ-400 VIII and FQ-360 IX was around 350 and 360 lbft respectively (the lower powered IX 360 actually made more torque standard than the older FQ-400), and that was after all the work that Ralliart did... with the FQ-400 X it was 390lbft for the UK, but the FQ engines are built so it&#039;s not much of a problem tuning for more power until you&#039;re going for really stupid numbers. The stock Japanese and US market engines and non-FQ UK engines will go bang before the FQ cars do as a result. If you want a good example, Adam LZ blew his 4G63 in his Evo 5 up after launching it with only 360 lbft of torque.", "time": 1672482456, "resto": 26205101}, {"no": 26211335, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:35:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26211331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26211331</a><br>Evo articles on the Evo VIII, IX and X.<br>https://www.evo.co.uk/mitsubishi/62<wbr>73/mitsubishi-evo<br>https://www.evo.co.uk/mitsubishi/ev<wbr>o/6452/mitsubishi-evo<br>https://www.evo.co.uk/mitsubishi/ev<wbr>o/6763/mitsubishi-evo-x-fq-400<br><br>And the only 40th anniversary, only 40 made, UK only 440 FQ:<br>https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph<wbr>-driven/mitsubishi-evo-x-fq-440-mr-<wbr>-ph-used-review/41260", "time": 1672482940, "resto": 26205101}, {"no": 26211337, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:37:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "nothing, they are pigfat and have nothing to do with rallying.", "time": 1672483048, "resto": 26205101}, {"no": 26211342, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)05:43:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26205101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26205101</a><br>Subaru drivers are fucking annoying, can&#039;t even cruise in my boosted Honda without them noticing me a mile away and speeding up just to pull up next to me trying to bait me into an impromptu race.

One of the bigger car blogs (Jalopnik?) had a whole schpiel article about it. A crossover customer is some mom with screaming kids that just wants to be done with the purchase and out ASAP and doesn&#039;t even know you can haggle. Then on the other hand the sports car buyer will want to walk from the sale because someone put a shoeprint on the floor mats. Margins are also usually lower on sports cars as well because they make so few and the tooling and engineering is still really expensive. Sports cars are a loss leader, they just are. I do have people that flog them and then blame the car and demand warranty work, though. A warranty isn&#039;t a license to abuse a car 24/7 without repercussion and treating it like that is just going to make sports cars more and more scarce.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA. During the BPR years Ratel would form the SRO which has been shaping GT racing for almost 30 years.", "time": 1671993842, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195774, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190601</a><br><a href=\"#p26190626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190626</a><br>I never get why europoor teams get so butthurt by large displacement engines in racing. like if your angry about murricans making 12L v8s and winning, maybe use larger engines your self instead of running on 1L v6s in your cars and expecting everyone else to do the same", "time": 1672002141, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_4518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672005636401813, "time": 1672005636, "md5": "gew40DwLhFVqlT44++al1Q==", "fsize": 192286, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26196163, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)19:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26195529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26195529</a><br>The Short-Tail F1 GTRs were nerfed throughout the 1996 season, to the point that they were heavier than the Road Car versions and only making about 400-ish Horsepower at best.

It was open to a page titled1930 something \u201cMescherschmitt fuel injection \u201c. I asked what those specs were for and he said \u201cyour 86 Scirocco\u201d. Probably the best car I\u2019ve ever had.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims.
