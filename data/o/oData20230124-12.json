They should have been leaning much more heavily into the local cultural aspect, taking cues from shows like Travel Man or even James May&#039;s own &quot;Our Man in Japan/Italy&quot; series. (What?

much as anyone, but as a &#039;77 F150 owner I need to point out a couple errors in those pictures. First, the old truck in the first pic is 2wd vs a 4wd new truck. If you got a 4wd truck back in the old days it came with a factory lift. As an aside, compared to today&#039;s &quot;it snows where I live so I need 4wd&quot; in the old days 4wd trucks weren&#039;t even in the same catalog as the main product line. It was assumed normal people bought 2wd trucks, even if they had to sometimes go a little offroad. Then you had the special catalog for loggers and hunters with the 4wd trucks.<br><br>Second, in the second pic they&#039;re comparing a long bed old truck vs short bed newer trucks. Beds didn&#039;t magically get shorter in 1980. You always could choose an 8&#039; or 6.5&#039; bed. You can still get a single cab, 8&#039; bed truck even if they&#039;re not big sellers. And the newer trucks in that pic are crew cab models which by default. People buy more crewcab trucks with tiny beds because it&#039;s just a way to have an SUV without driving the same car as your wife.

And if so, why does it happen?<br>I understand for luxury cars like Maybach or whatever, but why also on enthusiast and sporty cars? Would a thumper kei car be that bad?

Pre-orders are gone, and we don&#039;t want to create a 6 week lead time (pre-order + production).<br><br>- I worked briefly with desuprint who informed me of issues with production, a large one being that Taiyo works in Inkscape primarily and the design would have to be completely rebuilt in Illustrator along with the white ink layer. desuprint also had the foil we wanted to do it on, however he has told me a while ago he is unable to reproduce it. The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass. Paying over $10 for a sticker is stupid, and that&#039;s ironic because my store will only offer tracked shipping in the future and I apologize for any international orders because shipping is literally going to eat people&#039;s asses.<br><br>- Many things have been on my backlog for a while. In the past 6 months, nearly every original Taiyo design has been under renovation along with new(er) projects. I reflected over my FOTM drop and figured it wasn&#039;t something I wanted to force myself to do like I did before after Grandmasterslices gave me input that made me realize I was pushing myself way too hard and getting frustrated over nothing.<br><br>tl;dr no thanks, see you when the store is open someday.", "time": 1674111193, "resto": 26265022, "trip": "!!VDR3ijdJ5Rz"}, {"no": 26274151, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)02:01:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26273846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26273846</a><br>Damn you right.

Not sure how many opportunities in life I&#039;ll get to buy one and I&#039;d like to do it while I&#039;m still young and can enjoy it. <br><br>Anyway, I&#039;ve seen an advert for a 76 Chevrolet Camaro (the one in the picture shown). The description is: &quot;305 v8, engine has been stripped and refreshed with many new parts, entire cooling system renewed, new carb, new battery, brakes are new throughout, various bushes replaced, new tyres, excellent bodywork underneath, tidy paintwork with few defects, overhaul looks good, interior is excellent, all electrics and gauges work. A great driver&quot;<br><br>The asking price is \u00a314,000. <br><br>To me this seems a little cheap given the description. Am I off the mark? I&#039;d go to check the car out before buying, but does this scream &#039;obvious bullshit&#039; to those of you with more knowledge? <br><br>There&#039;s no explicit description about the diff or transmission. From my very limited understanding, the 76 Camaros often have trouble with mounts, though by the sounds of things (&quot;replaced bushes&quot;), this seems okay. And even I know that with classics, one of the main things is just the rust, though the &quot;excellent bodywork underneath&quot; would suggest this is probably okay. <br><br>I&#039;m okay with doing minor work myself (I am an engineer and fairly hands-on, just typically not with cars), and I have a good mechanic friend (albeit never worked with American cars), so I shouldn&#039;t be completely in the dark if/when trouble arises, as I&#039;d expect with anything old, but am I looking at a guaranteed money drain here/something too good to be true? Regular amounts of maintenance for a classic is fine, but I&#039;m not trying to buy a project car or anything like that. <br><br>Any advice appreciated, especially if you think I&#039;m being an idiot!

We have tax bands that dictate how much tax you pay based on emissions. Some V8s are cheaper to tax than 4 pot turbos. As for OP you can get historic tax / mot exemption on classic vehicles (40 years or older). You still have to &quot;tax&quot; the car if it&#039;s in their system and on the road. So once a year you get a reminder to let them know the car is either on the road, or SORN (statutory off road notice, meaning it&#039;s not being used on the roads). It doesn&#039;t cost anything to do. The MOT exemption means it no longer has to pass a year inspection to be road legal. However, it does have to be road worthy.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

The white 86 got a 49.2. Just to give you an idea of the ranges there was ~150 cars and I landed somewhere in 80th place, the white 86 landed in 30. But thats in all classes combined, including kit cars and f1 style non street legal cars.<br><br>Pic rel is a crazy K swapped miata I saw there, he won first place against everyone with a 44.3", "filename": "1666499847266", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 2268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674481284269883, "time": 1674481284, "md5": "DtxCMjk8m59Ouq0lfYzOHA==", "fsize": 1918546, "resto": 26278272}, {"no": 26287717, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:53:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26287694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26287694</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;partly because it was my first time at autocross</span><br>free tip, it&#039;s all about vision. there are 300 cones out there and you only have to look at about 10 of them. look at the next cone that matters as soon as youve lined up for the current one", "filename": "s2k_slowturn", "ext": ".png", "w": 913, "h": 614, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1674481984587372, "time": 1674481984, "md5": "Ti2LtijYFzk1JmVOWetiXg==", "fsize": 837903, "resto": 26278272}, {"no": 26287726, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)08:56:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26281188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26281188</a><br>A big single is the best exhaust for my car in terms of power/weight.
