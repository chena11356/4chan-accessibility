I wish I had researched the car more before I bought it, might have gone for the 335i instead. There aren&#039;t as many aftermarket upgrades for the E60 chasis as there are for the E90. Just changed the oil filter housing gaskets. Got a massive valve cover leak into my spark plug wells, so I&#039;m replacing the VC, plugs, and coils. Upgraded the PCV valve on the new one, but when I went to remove the old valve cover the PCV hose broke, so I&#039;m replacing it with an oil catch can. Also, when I removed the intake manifold one of the wires snapped from the sensor so now I have to see about soldering it. Other than that I bought a tial blow off valve + charge pipe and a vrsf dual cone intake(should&#039;ve bought the BMS one for the CARB sticker). I still need to change all of my fluids and the oil pan gasket, and I think I got a couple ABS codes. Just bought MHD so I&#039;m going to see it in better detail tomorrow. I plan on getting an aftermarket radiator, intercooler, and downpipes, but the options for the e60 are slim. I&#039;m in california so I&#039;m trying to figure out the smog situation as well with the downpipes, I read that MHD can manipulate the ecu readings but that was in 2017, and they started cracking down on modded firmware in 2021. I still need to do the water pump, thermostat, high pressure fuel pump(might be causing limp mode), injectors(11s --&gt; 12s), and the turbos. Trying to figure out the turbo situation in Cali, I would prefer to maximize power with pure stage 2, despite this being my daily, current turbos are rattling but mhd might fix that. I paid $7k for it probably looking at another $10k just to bring it to stage 2, and that&#039;s without new wheels, brakes, and suspension.", "time": 1670752210, "resto": 26154172}, {"no": 26155237, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26154172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26154172</a><br>Stay away from the auto&#039;s, bmw called the trans fluid lifetime which resulted in people never getting them serviced despite ZF saying to change the fluid and filter no later than 50k miles.

The E10 bolt near the &quot;mickey mouse&quot; flange that goes into the oil filter housing stripped, and the flange broke so I bought an aluminum one. If you end up doing the oil filter housing gasket make sure to remove the other 2 bolts first and then use a pry bar to rotate the housing to break the bolt before you attempt to loosen it. It&#039;s aluminum and due to its location is difficult to torque, so most people overtorque it by hand and strip it. Also make sure to buy an extra long 10mm deep socket if you plan on changing the valve cover, in order to remove the nuts on the struts that ground the ignition wires. Good luck removing the fan to access the oil cooler line bolt as well, you&#039;ll have to jack the car up and remove the splash cover in order to reach the torx bolt that attaches a metal line onto the center of the fan. I couldn&#039;t find a video that showed this on YouTube and had to figure it out myself, not sure what the line is called. Cleaning the engine is a bitch since you can&#039;t use brake cleaner without damaging the plastic. Try to do all of the maintenance at once or you&#039;ll end up wasting your money on gaskets. Make sure to work on leaks from the top down and to replace the belt and pulleys after you handle the oil filter housing gasket, and do it ASAP.

Next day still have the same symptoms...audible clicking sound coming from one of the cylinders. Took it to the shop saying I think its a misfire but they didn&#039;t detect one. Shop told me a lifter is sticking, which makes sense given the tick. They drained a little oil and added in some automatic transmission fluid to unstick it. They told me to drive 1.5k miles with the atf added in before swapping the oil. The tick seems to have improved and the acceleration was instantly better but still off (only drove about 40 miles since atf was added).
