The team that year aimed for overall victory and as such acquired a car that could bring them that. That said car was the 2002 GT500 spec Honda NSX. The mid-engine car was already a proven victor in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship thanks to the three wins earned by Nakajima Racing, and one each by Mugen and Dome in the 2002 season.<br><br>The #3 Honda NSX was entered under the Sport Auto banner and was driven by Armin Hahne, Robert Lechner, Markus Oestreich, and Robin Liddell. A few changes were done to the car to accommodate Nurburgring and the length of the race. One of those changes was the V6 engine being down tuned from the JGTC regulated 500hp to 420hp for reliability. Other changes include endurance lights and Michelin tires of which the car never ran on in the JGTC. The NSX weigh a minimum of 1200kg as par the rules of A6, the class the Honda competed in at Nurburgring.<br><br>The #3 Sport Auto NSX had a small amount of kilometres under its belt before contesting the 24 Hours of Nurburgring. Lack of testing however didn&#039;t stop the German squad from placing inside the top 15 in qualifying, showing the potential of a JGTC car in uncharted territory. The NSX successfully started the race keeping up with the cars ahead of it which included DTM derived machinery from Audi and Opel. The car however experienced technical problems early in the race and completed 38 laps/7 hours before retiring. https://youtu.be/LRKIAK5Yw3w", "filename": "1280px-Honda_NSX-R_(24h_N\u00fcrburgring)",

The leash on the Group 6 prototypes was already loosened to allow manufacturers to run new engines and/or cars a year early. Porsche used this opportunity to test the engine for the upcoming 956 Group C car in anger during the 24 Hours of Le Mans. One of their privateers, Kremer Racing used the same loophole for Le Mans, not to look ahead but to bring an old legend out of retirement; the Porsche 917.<br><br>The Group 6 regulations of 1972, which stipulated a three-litre displacement limit, had rendered the 917 obsolete from World Championship event. In the following decade, Kremer Racing actually restored one of the original 917s for a customer, so they had intimate knowledge of the twelve-cylinder engined racer. The two Kremer brothers reckoned there was life left in the design, especially if it was updated to suit the latest tyre technology. So, instead of bringing one of the existing cars out of retirement, Kremer Racing decided to build a brand new 917, with support from Porsche.<br><br>One of the main reasons to start from scratch was that Kremer reckoned the original all-aluminium spaceframe chassis would no longer be up to the task. Already stressed to and at times beyond its limits, the lightweight frame was likely not capable of dealing with the much higher loads produced by 1981-specification, slick tyres. Using the drawings supplied by Porsche and a higher gauge material, a new, sturdier frame was built. The new chassis tipped the scales at 65 kg compared to 50 kg of the original. The suspension geometry was also altered to make the most of the latest tyre technology.", "time": 1673360057, "resto": 26233298}, {"no": 26245056, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:14:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Porsche offered Kremer Racing a choice of two versions of the Type 912 engine.

While the second option was obviously more powerful, it was also thirstier. Taking into consideration the particular needs of the Le Mans track with its long straights, the Kremers understandably opted for power over frugality.

Naturally, the original design of the 917 was carried over but again changes were made to incorporate the latest ideas in aerodynamics. Ideas was the best description as there was no time to actually test the final package in the wind-tunnel. Among the most obvious alterations were the removal of rounded lower sections of the body in favour of slab sides to help generate some ground effect. A full width rear wing was fitted, mounted between two sizeable tail fins.<br><br>With backing from French real estate company Malardeau Enterprises and BP, the 917 K/81 was fielded by Kremer Racing for the all-French line-up of Bob Wollek, Xavier Lapeyre and Guy Chausseuil. With the exception of a brief shakedown at the N\u00fcrburgring, the car was untested. As a result, it suffered from a variety of problems, in particular on the important long straights where the 917 barely breached the 300 km/h barrier. This was partly addressed by changing the gear ratios but it was also obvious that there were also aerodynamic problems.<br><br>With a qualifying time that was a full 17 seconds slower than the pole-sitting works Porsche, the new 917 started the race back in 18th.

The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800\u2013900 kilometres (500\u2013560 mi) per day. &quot;Amateurs&quot; typically struggle with the event. The rough terrain and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.<br><br>The Dakar rally features a much greater variety of vehicles than traditional rally&#039;s, including bikes, quads, and trucks. Dominant manufacturers within the Dakar Rally are KTM for bikes, Yamaha for quads and Kamaz in trucks. Out of the big three Kamaz are most notable as they have won using the largest variety of vehicles instead of sticking with a select few models. In 2006 a tracked vehicle category was proposed and rejected due to the necessary volume of sub-divisions to ensure fair competition. In 2018 an EV category was proposed, this to was rejected as &quot;there currently exists no electric vehicle capable of crossing the most remote stages of the Dakar unsupported and it would place an unnecessary risk on support crews to enable them to do so&quot;, despite annual reviews and counter-claims this continues to be the case.

Tesla&#039;s full self-driving in relatively unreliable relying on cameras and nothing more. It&#039;s fascinating how they collect data. The whole self driving system is reliant on data collection by those cameras. The consumer is the guinea pig which is funny. Get all of that data, plug it into some AI and there you have a fully functional algorithm. Point is, not real self driving.

This isn&#039;t the same as common law where an issue arises between two parties whether its private v private or private v state and a court rules in a way that creates a framework on how to settle that kind of matter; the law is created in the ruling.<br>When SCOTUS rules on something like a 4th amendment violation involving the police they analyze the context of the 4th amendment as it applies to the case and issues a ruling on whether something is or isn&#039;t constitutional.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The concept of \u2018unconstitutional law\u2019 is alien there</span><br>It&#039;s not, virtually every EU country has its own constitution and many parts of the UK still use Common Law because thats how Common Law came to the US, the British established it in the colonies early on.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; because of Parliamentary Supremacy making it so any law written can overrule the constitution of those countries (meaning their constitution is worthless, lel)</span><br>This isn&#039;t true either.

This comes from how, as european nations became republics and tried to follow the US model, they fundamentally misunderstood the roles of government and the rule of law.

He was superstitious about their red hair, disapproving of their rambunctious lifestyles, and embittered over their considerable contribution to the success of the Ford Motor Company. In the early days of the Company the Dodges produced most of the Ford cars, everything except the bodies and tires and contributed ten thousand dollars toward the initiial capital of Ford, while Henry failed to contribute a cent. Ford planned to squeeze the Dodges out of the Company by diverting income to produce increasing portions of parts in house.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the Dodge brothers left the Ford Motor Company to produce their own cars in 1914, they adopted as their logo two interlocking deltas with the initials DB in the center. The logo in place resembled the Star of David, giving rise to the rumor around Ford that the brothers were Jewish. Ford notoriously disliked and distrusted the Jewish race.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The interlocking delta design was actually an ancient middle eastern insignia, that was popular among masons, including the Dodge Brothers. To the Dodge brothers, it also reflected the unity, fidelity and brotherhood shared by the brothers who were so close that they refused to accept any mail not addressed to both of them. The Detroit Saturday Night magazine commented on the Ford rumors that \u2018[T]he theory that they [the Dodge brothers] were Jews is quite as sane as any other we have seen in the anti-semitic antics of Ford\u2019s paper [The Dearborn Independent]\u201d The Dodge brothers both died in 1920 and were laid to rest in a shared mausoleum of an Egyptian Revival Architecture.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The emblem contains the design of the interlocking deltas, (without the DB) capped with Egyptian style metal latticework and a crescent moon on the top. The Dodge brothers were determinedly Protestant in their religious affiliations with masonic pride and proclivities.</span><br><br>Well poisoning kike, nice try mossad", "time": 1673400639, "resto": 26245590}, {"no": 26246990, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)20:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26246676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26246676</a><br>Volkswagen.
