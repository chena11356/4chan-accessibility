And that&#039;s with an already expensive car to begin with (compared to the Z at least). The Camaro is well set up from the factory meanwhile the Z has all it&#039;s performance still on the table.

On a vq37vhr (the 370z engine) you can do 500whp just fine, and you&#039;ll find thousands of examples of this. Just buy a FI kit, slap it on, and your at 400-500whp without putting serious strain on the internals. There are multiple people on this board with 400whp+ VQ&#039;s.

I&#039;ve talked with my wife about it, and she also thinks it&#039;s really cool, so I think we&#039;re going to sign up for the 2024 run. We plan to do the &quot;touring&quot; category, which the website describes like this:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this category there are no rules, no timing, no scoring, no difficult offroad sections. The only thing that counts is the finish line, completing the challenge and making new friends. This is also knows as the \u201cparty division\u201d of the rally. The participants are allowed to choose which roads they take to the finish line. You can take detours to see sights or skip entire stages and catch up with the rally 2-3 days later.</span><br><br>Anyone here ever done something like this?

I&#039;m thinking to get something cheap enough that I will not miss it if it gets wrecked or if I don&#039;t want to pay to ship it home. Right now I&#039;m leaning towards a Citroen Xantia with XUD9 engine. Air conditioning, cruise control, and a smooth ride seem like nice features for such a trip. The hydropneumatic suspension allows lots of ground clearance and should soak-up the bumps on shitty roads, keeping things comfortable and also improving reliability by having less shaking of the car. The suspension should also make it easy to change tires (no jack needed!). Other cars that sounds interesting/suitable are Renault Kangoo 4x4, Suzuki Grand Vitara, or random Ladas (Niva, Zhiguli, 112, Granta, whatever). <br><br><br>What would you drive for a trip like this?", "filename": "budapest-bamako-rally-2014-18", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 588, "h": 390, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 165, "tim": 1669636336423343, "time": 1669636336, "md5": "y7lT0Q1n5Gj3yjbh7zzK7Q==", "fsize": 83961, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "driving-from-budapest-to-bamako", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 26118412, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)08:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26118318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26118318</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Citroen Xantia</span><br><br>Good look finding one that is not pissing hydraulic fluid everywhere.<br>Good and cheap ones are gone for good", "time": 1669641697, "resto": 26118318}, {"no": 26118480, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)08:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26118318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26118318</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;XUD9</span><br>Is a solid choice of an engine for this rally, but xantia specific parts might be hard to get on the road, you could opt for a peugeot with that engine since there&#039;s a lot of them still rolling in Africa or even a suzuki samurai if you could find one", "time": 1669643687, "resto": 26118318}, {"no": 26118483, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)08:55:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26118412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26118412</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Good and cheap ones are gone for good</span><br>They&#039;ve gone from western europe to eastern europe.

The same thing happened to a lot of millenials, but I don&#039;t know any millenials male or female who were ever afraid or stressed out by driving. I&#039;m 30, I had a computer in my room and grew up playing hours of vidya nightly for most of my life til I was 18. I hated going outside and playing sports. I had extreme helicopter parenting and an overprotective mother (which I resented). <br><br>For me getting a car was freedom. Finally I could go places without having my mom drive me everywhere. It was truly the mark of becoming an adult. <br><br>It hasn&#039;t been mentioned in this thread but I think the main reason why zoomers don&#039;t care about driving is because of Uber/Lyft and rideshare services. For most Americans outside of New York City or downtown Chicago or a couple of other big cities, there were really no taxi cab services in the late 20th century and the early 2000s. Getting a cab to the airport in 2007 or earlier consisted of calling the cab company, ideally a day in advance, and scheduling a pre-arranged trip. I even remember in college in 2009 and 2010 doing this when we wanted to go to Mardi Gras in our city (I was in STL at the time). We needed a cab and called one and the earliest they could get a cab out to us was like 2 hours later. <br><br>Point being, before Uber, if you didn&#039;t have a car, you were shit outta luck if you wanted to go somewhere not within walking distance. No public transit, no real cab service, it just wasn&#039;t easy to get around. <br><br>Uber is essentially public transit. Now you can be an 18 year old and if you want to hang out with your friends who live 10 miles away, you can just pay 10-15 bucks and take an uber to their house, maybe even less money than that.

The only time/reason not to use sport mode is if the sport mode on your model keeps it from going into top gear or the highest CVT ratio, etc. and giving you worse MPG (I know BMW sport+ does this). As long as it will still go into the top gear, no reason not to use it if you find its behavior preferable.<br><br>Also of note is that sometimes sport mode is linked to firmer suspension settings if your car has adjustable shocks, so on shitty roads you will find the ride worse.", "filename": "AllSoTiresome", "ext": ".gif", "w": 657, "h": 487, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1669601150676917, "time": 1669601150, "md5": "hbzmPLieONhD94Rlv3g8/g==", "fsize": 3290360, "resto": 26116896}, {"no": 26117533, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:09:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26116896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26116896</a><br>what pill? it&#039;s a button<br>you pansy city boys dont know anything<br>just go back to driving your electric scooter", "time": 1669604954, "resto": 26116896}, {"no": 26117544, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:13:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26116896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26116896</a><br>lol lmao even", "time": 1669605207, "resto": 26116896}], "last_modified": 1669605207}, {"no": 26116666, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)16:12:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "*blocks your path*", "filename": "learner", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 427, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1669583541305244, "time": 1669583541, "md5": "PvhVneOesCaOG12Ep3rzMg==", "fsize": 86624, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "blocks-your-path", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 26116670, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)16:12:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26116666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26116666</a><br>this is an American board", "time": 1669583569, "resto": 26116666}, {"no": 26116694, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)16:20:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is an American board</span>", "filename": "1669584034965", "ext": ".png", "w": 686, "h": 798, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669584042539290, "time": 1669584042, "md5": "0fnDp+pbzv/FuQvuYdwICQ==", "fsize": 67046, "resto": 26116666}, {"no": 26117540, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26116666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26116666</a><br>*pass it*", "time": 1669605109, "resto": 26116666}], "last_modified": 1669605109}, {"no": 26116035, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:43:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate this faggot", "filename": "unnamed", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669570991382570, "time": 1669570991, "md5": "NULp+et/aa5wycCiphCgpw==", "fsize": 79582, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-hate-this-faggot", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 26116039, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;eceleb</span><br>seems like you\u2019re the faggot", "time": 1669571081, "resto": 26116035}, {"no": 26117536, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:10:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26116035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26116035</a><br>why", "time": 1669605047, "resto": 26116035}, {"no": 26117538, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:11:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Literally who", "time": 1669605079, "resto": 26116035}], "last_modified": 1669605079}, {"no": 26117445, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)21:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Think I got bad brake pads", "com": "Whenever I\u2019m sitting at a red light or slowing down, my car starts to vibrate.
