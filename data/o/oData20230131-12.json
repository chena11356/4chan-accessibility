Pre-orders are gone, and we don&#039;t want to create a 6 week lead time (pre-order + production).<br><br>- I worked briefly with desuprint who informed me of issues with production, a large one being that Taiyo works in Inkscape primarily and the design would have to be completely rebuilt in Illustrator along with the white ink layer. desuprint also had the foil we wanted to do it on, however he has told me a while ago he is unable to reproduce it. The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass. Paying over $10 for a sticker is stupid, and that&#039;s ironic because my store will only offer tracked shipping in the future and I apologize for any international orders because shipping is literally going to eat people&#039;s asses.<br><br>- Many things have been on my backlog for a while. In the past 6 months, nearly every original Taiyo design has been under renovation along with new(er) projects. I reflected over my FOTM drop and figured it wasn&#039;t something I wanted to force myself to do like I did before after Grandmasterslices gave me input that made me realize I was pushing myself way too hard and getting frustrated over nothing.<br><br>tl;dr no thanks, see you when the store is open someday.", "time": 1674111193, "resto": 26265022, "trip": "!!VDR3ijdJ5Rz"}, {"no": 26274151, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)02:01:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26273846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26273846</a><br>Damn you right.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

Technologies have hard limits as to how efficient or how powerful they can be. Steam power has a defined limit to how efficient it can be based on the physical properties of water and the inevitability of energy loss through heat transfer. Same thing with chargeable batteries.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

He told me that&#039;s physically impossible and I told him it isn&#039;t because it happened. Which is true. We can put the hook in the front of the car if you want but like I already said this car is rwd so you would think lifting the back would make more sense. He pushed the car himself around the lot to turn it around. He was so fucking angry because it&#039;s hard. I don&#039;t understand why he insisted on moving it but hand. and then started wrapping chains on the suspension so I took a picture of it. I said hey man, they&#039;re straight now. If they&#039;re bent later, you&#039;re paying for it. He freaked the fuck out and he was like oh you&#039;re gonna take pictures? Fuck no! I don&#039;t work like this! I said ok then just use the tow hook. He got in his truck and left. I called him a fat faggot. He stopped the truck got out and asked what did you say to me like he was going to do something. And I said, why don&#039;t you just tow it by the tow hook... You fat faggot? And he left. I complained, obviously they sent another driver. Methed out white wigger covered in face and hand tattoos. Got my car onto his flat bed using the tow hook in maybe 30 seconds. Drove me to the destination. And stopped in the street, and I asked him could you just back it into the driveway? He said ok well let me just get it off here and then you and me will push it. He loaded it off the truck, told me he was gonna go park his truck so he wasn&#039;t blocking traffic and then took off into the sunset never to be seen again. Hopefully he died of AIDS and a fentanyl overdose.", "filename": "PXL_20220219_193713898.MP~2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1255, "h": 1179, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1675043774730736, "time": 1675043774, "md5": "7AB0YC5LV663MRatC3oEew==", "fsize": 375889, "resto": 26307534}, {"no": 26309181, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26307534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26307534</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spend money so that once you lose all of your money by crashing people can drag you out of the way of the other loser idiot who&#039;s going to crash too</span><br>Wow, what is the name of this specific hobby so that I can avoid it forever?", "time": 1675044035, "resto": 26307534}, {"no": 26309187, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:02:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26309164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26309164</a><br>And by the way here&#039;s what that looks like.
