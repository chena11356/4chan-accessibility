It was open to a page titled1930 something \u201cMescherschmitt fuel injection \u201c. I asked what those specs were for and he said \u201cyour 86 Scirocco\u201d. Probably the best car I\u2019ve ever had.

It is true that some modern cars can pretty easily make 300k, maybe even some current German cars, but nothing at the price point of an E-class is built overall to the level of craftsmanship today that these were back then. And when parts do fail, the parts themselves are usually able to be disassembled and repaired e.g. replacing o-rings in the self leveling suspension valve, or replacing a simple check valve in the vacuum pump.

The owner of the Rivian R1T pickup, Glenn Gordon, told WPLG Local 10 News that he\u2019s been a resident for some 27 years. Now, just two weeks after receiving his new truck, the HOA sent a letter citing the following rule.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cTrucks, trailers, Recreational Vehicles (RVs) and/or commercial vehicles of any kind are not permitted to be parked anywhere\u2026 except inside of your garage during overnight hours.\u201d Gordon says that \u201cThese were written in the 1980s by Arvida and it said no trucks and no vans. Since then, trucks have become a popular vehicle for personal use.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He\u2019s right. Oftentimes, trucks are less about actually hauling, towing, or working than they are about being a status symbol these days.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA. During the BPR years Ratel would form the SRO which has been shaping GT racing for almost 30 years.", "time": 1671993842, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195774, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190601</a><br><a href=\"#p26190626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190626</a><br>I never get why europoor teams get so butthurt by large displacement engines in racing. like if your angry about murricans making 12L v8s and winning, maybe use larger engines your self instead of running on 1L v6s in your cars and expecting everyone else to do the same", "time": 1672002141, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_4518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672005636401813, "time": 1672005636, "md5": "gew40DwLhFVqlT44++al1Q==", "fsize": 192286, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26196163, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)19:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26195529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26195529</a><br>The Short-Tail F1 GTRs were nerfed throughout the 1996 season, to the point that they were heavier than the Road Car versions and only making about 400-ish Horsepower at best.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

Per CNBC, the annual global auto survey of 915 executives from KPMG, an international consulting and accounting firm, has found that 76% of them are troubled by the economy and high interest rates and how both will affect their business in 2023. US-based auto executives are even more concerned with 84% reporting back.<br><br>The bottom line is that auto execs are becoming less bullish about the number of pure battery electric vehicles in and outside of the US by 2030. For example, last year&#039;s survey of EV global sales estimates by 2030 ranged from 20% to 70%.<br><br>This year, those numbers were down from 10% to 40%. Here in the US, the median sales expectation for EVs was 35% of the new vehicle market. In 2021, it was 65%. Why is this a problem for the US government?<br>Because the Biden administration is aiming for a 50% adoption rate by 2030.<br><br>&quot;There&#039;s still a sense of optimism long term, and yet, most importantly, there&#039;s a sense of realism in the near term. You see this realism throughout the entire survey,&quot; Gary Silberg, KPMG&#039;s global head of automotive, told the new outlet. &quot;You can be long-term optimistic, but near term, you&#039;ve got to be very realistic,&quot; he added. &quot;It&#039;s not rainbows and butterflies and euphoria anymore, it&#039;s game on.&quot;<br><br>Aside from economic and supply chain concerns, auto execs are nervous about stricter requirements for federal tax credits when purchasing new EVs as well as rising prices for raw materials for batteries.

They also have electronic driver aids which allows more amateur drivers to participate which has the knock on effect of more racecars that can be sold to privateers. With so many teams buying up GT3 cars, event organizers usually try to incorporate them in their races. And with so many events where GT3 cars are eligible, a given team has more opportunity to get the most out of their investment.<br><br>Part of GT3&#039;s success was keeping amateur drivers involved often enforcing that each team of drivers has at least 1 amateur-level driver. These Am drivers often rich assholes that paid their way to the seat which helps fund the team if they didn&#039;t finance the team wholesale. The other part of it&#039;s success is the wide spread use of the concept of Balance of Performance in which cars can be handicapped or given a break in various criteria such as peak power, fuel tank volume, minimum weight, etc. The point would be to make cars more even in their performance for tighter racing (although many times it doesn&#039;t work out like that). <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Is there a development ladder with GT3 (i.e., more prestigious series existing that only accept the best drivers) like there is with F1 and IndyCar? </span><br>Pro drivers try to get a seat wherever they can. Whether that means driving a GT3 car ever varies with each career. For Am drivers, most organizations usually require some experience in motorsport before they can certify your license. As far as the next tier beyond GT3, there used to be higher levels in GT racing (nominally GT1 and GT2/GTE), but they&#039;ve since been cancelled usually due to costs and participating teams and manufacturers. Some series have taken to making Pro-only GT3 categories, otherwise drivers and teams have taken to racing prototype cars after growing out of GT3.", "time": 1672249904, "resto": 26201674}, {"no": 26203509, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:11:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26201674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26201674</a><br>balance of performance means the costs wont go out of control, they are relatively cheap and even a 50 year old dentist shitter could drive them relatively fast because of all the driver aids", "time": 1672251093, "resto": 26201674}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26201417, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)19:40:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;car hater hates cars</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still makes headlines</span>", "filename": "1672151205221", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 1352, "tn_w": 133, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672188016940066, "time": 1672188016, "md5": "DDbnmtf9QSrbnLjUq0BB1w==", "fsize": 828408, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "car-hater-hates-cars", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 26201437, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)19:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26201417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26201417</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;aggressive&quot; mode</span><br>I imagine this means heuristic defensive driving?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;drive 20% higher than the speed limit&quot;</span><br>Neat, it has the option of driving with traffic<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;w-why are these options???</span><br>I hate this faggot so much.

Look at this shit. Looks like a promo for a mobile game with its flat environmental textures, cheap harsh lighting and rushed modelling. I&#039;d rather play Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 than any of these Goysoft shovelware games with zero passion or creativity put into them. Even fucking GTA Online is a better car collectathon and it doesn&#039;t even have licensed cars. I looked at the Horizon 5 carlist and to give you an idea how lazy and dogshit the devs are, the only Infiniti in the game is a 2015 Q60 concept lmao. They couldn&#039;t be fucked to tweak the model into a new road version but instead reused some old concept from almost 8 years ago. My last Horizon was 3 and most of the cars in 5 are reused from that game and earlier entries. I was sick of the asset copypaste even back in 3 which is partly why it was my last one.", "filename": "zw-mercedes-amg-one-forza-horizon-5-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1417, "h": 1063, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672090054717737, "time": 1672090054, "md5": "CU65FeQJ23y0hgoeQJw1Ng==", "fsize": 414877, "resto": 26192576}, {"no": 26198214, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)16:31:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26198201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26198201</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3</span><br>Lmao there&#039;s not even a single BMW, why would anyone play that", "time": 1672090266, "resto": 26192576}, {"no": 26198272, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)16:50:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26198214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26198214</a><br>They have other goodies thrown in there for the patricians.
