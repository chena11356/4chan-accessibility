I can get them at costco for just under $800 but they won&#039;t be there for a week and I unfortunately need something today.<br>Before I go and buy these, is there something better that is in the same price range? Or is this a good option to go with for the price? <br>I&#039;m also wondering if it&#039;s worth it to get the certificates from discount tire, or if that&#039;s just to squeeze more money out of me. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2018 Golf GTI</span>", "filename": "tires", "ext": ".png", "w": 1016, "h": 270, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 66, "tim": 1668699177290531, "time": 1668699177, "md5": "cosmgOaXEOiGYXPmhgIQ1A==", "fsize": 65114, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "a-pothole-took-out-one-of-my-tires-last-night-i", "replies": 2, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 26086130, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:38:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Terrible fucking tire, get the comp-2", "filename": "Screen Shot 2022-11-17 at 8.37.54 AM", "ext": ".png", "w": 993, "h": 417, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1668699524003621, "time": 1668699524, "md5": "M5u3QFdJwp5qWqc95T3pfw==", "fsize": 195908, "resto": 26086112}, {"no": 26086138, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:41:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26086112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26086112</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GTI</span><br>You can fit 235/40 with no issues, also all seasons are always a compromise that&#039;s jack of all trades master of none", "time": 1668699663, "resto": 26086112}], "last_modified": 1668699663}, {"no": 26085416, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:57:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are Subaru&#039;s so kino?", "filename": "0F643A9C-38C4-4918-985A-745BC8BC6699", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1350, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668668251522509, "time": 1668668251, "md5": "jsvXnpVMws7mOFF/gQgaWw==", "fsize": 258488, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-are-subarus-so-kino", "replies": 9, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 4, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 26085666, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:16:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Subaru has the best women", "filename": "B6BE04A1-9281-4905-AC21-A16E65401788", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668683791147932, "time": 1668683791, "md5": "7pMsZbSwvFL1HiSYnqnwiw==", "fsize": 34639, "resto": 26085416}, {"no": 26085667, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:17:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26085666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26085666</a><br>God, I wish that snow were my dick", "time": 1668683830, "resto": 26085416}, {"no": 26085925, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:18:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26085640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26085640</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the boxer engine layout vibrates a lot more</span><br>They don&#039;t. they&#039;re perfectly balanced and you often can&#039;t feel the engine at all.<br>t.

This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.
