A set of good headers will complete the package. You can also check with World Products. They make some offerings in iron that are a little less pricey than the premium Trick Flows.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door.

The 12V stubby is like a replacement for a 1/2\u201d ratchet, it\u2019s not going to do anything you can\u2019t do by hand. There\u2019s a huge difference in power if you get down on some of the mid torque 18V 1/2\u201d guns and they\u2019re only a couple inches long.

So if you\u2019re just buying into a cordless platform, skip the 12V stubby and check out something like the DeWalt 20V Atomic drill and impact driver kit, they\u2019re real affordable when they go on sale.

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.

All it does is makes it natural to plot the two curves against each other for the range of a typical automotive gasoline engine at the time the convention was established.<br><br>Don&#039;t drop out of high school next time.", "time": 1671516273, "resto": 26173437}, {"no": 26180979, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)01:11:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26180972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26180972</a><br>Ok fucks it got to do with the Richter scale?", "time": 1671516695, "resto": 26173437}, {"no": 26181001, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)01:24:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26180979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26180979</a><br>You&#039;d have to ask him, but I suspect he&#039;s talking about logarithmic scales like Richter. In a typical traditional engine setup where maybe care about some kind of racing application where acceleration is really the important thing, then neither torque nor horsepower tells you how fast the engine is going to be able to keep turning faster and faster, let alone how that affects the vehicle&#039;s ability to go faster and faster depending on gearing and what range of road speeds you might care about.<br><br>But, as a bit of aphoristic wisdom, it is true that you might hope you can keep the engine engine somewhere in the &quot;power band&quot; (i.e. hoursepower) if you want to maintain a high degree of acceleration or at least high speed where more power is needed to overcome fictional losses like wind resistance the rest. Whereas torque is often the more informative thing when it counts for truck or tractor action where you want to be able to begin acceleration from a lower RPM by being able to impel a lot of force on the drive line to get the vehicle up to speed speed where you&#039;re better able to expend the total work output (power output) capacity of the engine. It&#039;s a bit of a difficult subject if you you&#039;re not a math nerd, but I suspect that he&#039;s making a reasonably correct analogy that torque tells you more about a categorically lower RPM (think a diesel engine that doesn&#039;t typically spin all that fast) vs. a categorically higher RPM (think a gasoline engine where the lighter and faster-burning fuel will tend to expend more of its energy at higher piston speeds.) It&#039;s a perpetually difficult subject for these reasons and more, including how a dyno only measures one thing and then tries to infer both figures.", "time": 1671517483, "resto": 26173437}, {"no": 26181100, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)02:36:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26173437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26173437</a><br>Just get a 2 litre 16 valve long block like the ABF and you can churn out 100kw with some tweaks to the cams and pistons.", "time": 1671521799, "resto": 26173437}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26180592, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)21:27:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s manlier?

You know how in movies most of the important characters are attractive? Good-looking people exist in real life too, but you&#039;re unlikely to find such a concentration of beautiful people in real life as you do in Hollywood movies. It&#039;s kind of like that with the cars in those movies. Yes, you could see cars on the street like the ones in the movies, but it would be unusual to see so many that take it quite so far as the ones in the movies. For what it&#039;s worth, I consider that style to be more of a 90&#039;s thing than an early 00&#039;s thing, by the way. By the early 00&#039;s, it was already on the way out, and the dotcom crash / small recession around 2002 killed it in the US, imo. For a positive portrayal of that scene, visit your local library and see if they have old copies of Sports Compact Car magazine from the late 90&#039;s.

If it&#039;s low miles or otherwise &quot;preserved&quot;, flip it to a boomer and go buy a driver one and pocket the difference. They&#039;re very fun cars and definitely one of the worst to lock up in a garage as a pseudo art piece in this clown market where they sell for double what they&#039;re worth.<br>Assuming it&#039;s not a museum specimen, start modding it. This is your life now. I recommend at least a catback and probably headers. Not sure about the NA2s (assuming yours is one and not a facelifted 95-01), but the 3.0 cars are very quiet from factory and slow anyway, so you might as well wake it up and enjoy one of the better-sounding V6s. If you have the cash for a supercharger kit and can find one, I hear the extra few horses make the car not-slow. Turbos make them actually fast, but good luck finding kits for reasonable money.<br>Also: you should either start hoarding parts or praying for a recession, because everything&#039;s ricetaxed through the roof on these, even stock stuff.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims.

Incredibly simple, yet it works on multiple levels.<br>For one it tests if you have a concept of delayed reward. Reverse parking is slightly more difficult and time consuming than forward parking for a novice. Yet when you come to leave, driving forwards out of a space onto a busy street or parking lot is infinitely easier than backing out and being unable to see what&#039;s coming. The payoff is well worth it.<br>But that&#039;s not all<br>Reverse parking is easier than forward once you practice, but more difficult initially. So it is also a laziness test. Someone who gives no shits about what is better in the long run or improving themselves will always choose the lazy option of badly forward parking because it is &quot;easier and quicker&quot;, and they will spend their entire life doing that.<br>For those that aren&#039;t filtered by the laziness and intelligence test it actually works out even better once you practice due to the way cars turn. While going forwards the rear end follows the front and cuts the corner trailing behind you. You have little control over this. So to forward park properly, you have to swing the front out wide (which you don&#039;t always have room for) so that the rear end can cut the corner and end up in the right place. Most forward parkers are too stupid to realise this, so they end up backing out and in again multiple times or they just leave the car at a stupid angle they initially pulled in at.<br>On the contrary, while going backwards your car becomes rear steering. By thinking ahead you can make very tight turns and still end up placing the rear of the car exactly where it needs to be then correcting the placement of the front of the car in the same motion<br><br>Tl;dr being able to rear-park is a retard test", "time": 1671364524, "resto": 26174170}, {"no": 26176243, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There are a few reasons why backing into a parking space may be considered better than driving into a parking space head-on:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Improved visibility: </span><br>When you reverse park, you have a better view of your surroundings because you are facing the opposite direction.

Hybrid Electric Vehicles, especially Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicles are Electric Vehicles. Nobody gets caught up on the &#039;purity&#039; of the powertrain, especially when talking about powertrain development to conform to the reality of racing rulebooks which allow hydrogen refueling but not battery swapping. One of the advantages of electric powertrains is their ability to take advantage of multiple sources of electricity, and an endurance racing EV using a swappable high capacity battery would still have a similar design with a buffer battery for peak performance, and the KERS.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will last for less than half an hour at the average power consumption of 120 kW (that&#039;s 160 horsepower), leaving you with fuel-cell&#039;s 85 kW (114 hp)</span><br>Except that&#039;s not how it works. The 85kW fuel cell is continually generating electricity, so any time the car is drawing more power than that the fuel cell can provide its drawing on the power stored in the buffer battery, and any time the car is drawing less power than that, the fuel cell is filling the buffer battery back up. Also any time the car is decelerating its using the KERS to put energy back into the buffer battery.<br>As I said, this is very similar to how endurance racing performance hybrids work, and why they&#039;re so dominant because the battery acts as a buffer to keep the generator in a lower stress state.<br><br>Considering how much higher performance the N Vision 74&#039;s motors are, and how much better the Kinetic Energy Recovery they can provide is compared to the Prius, it would still almost certainly be able to outpace it.

I was not able to do 3 jobs in my garage. 1, replacing the rear lower control arms. 2 replacing the lock system module after it locked the doors shut, 3 reattaching the exhaust manifold after I did a full engine rebuild. For these jobs you need special tools and or a proper lift. To reattach the exhaust, they had to lift the car and then drop the engine down. There is no other way to access the studs. And that doesn&#039;t get into the dozens of jobs I did myself. Brakes, coolant system rebuild, entire cylinder head rebuild and timing, new clutch master and slave cylinder, new tie rods etc etc. I&#039;m not saying these repairs are a big deal, but a car that old will need them and will be expensive unless you can do them yourself.
