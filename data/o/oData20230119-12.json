The internet is not always right and sometimes a repair that seems to work great the first day will fail soon after if it&#039;s not done correctly, usually leaving people blaming the part rather than their install. If I do something, I&#039;ll do it once and will be doing it as a beginner at least for that particular model of car, if I hand it to someone that works on that car day in and day out they will be doing it for the 50th time that month and have it down to a reflex. There&#039;s something to be said for that. Also, a good mechanic that specializes in your car will know if anything is out of place. The V8 tuner that works on my Corvette could immediately point at every mod the car had from stock like the C6 Z06 shocks (on a C5) that I didn&#039;t even know it had from the previous owner (it&#039;s not obvious like an aftermarket intake tube, you have to just know what they look like to notice). It&#039;s about the reflexive knowledge of exactly how the car is supposed to look and when something is out of place, like you looking where you keep your wallet and keys and knowing in .2 seconds when your wallet isn&#039;t where it should be.

DO NOT JUMP on the running boards. Only shift your weight up and down while moving the entire length of the running board, like you are performing a suspension check.<br>6. With the boards still in the down position, loosen the button head Torx head bolts that go through the pinch weld. DO NOT loosen the hex head bolts on the back of the rocker panel. Then, either have someone sit on the center of the board or put some weight on the center of the board. While there is weight on the board, retighten the button head bolts going through the pinch weld.<br>7. Remove the weight from the board, and try moving the board up to the completely stowed position. Check to see if the board clears the pinch weld. If it clears, reinstall the motors and complete the installation. In some cases where the pinch weld is more uneven, you may need to do this complete procedure a second or third time. If the step still does not clear the pinch weld after several seating attempts, please continue on to Step 8.", "time": 1673734812, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260031, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:49:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259965</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DO NOT JUMP</span><br>Meth is one hell of a drug.", "time": 1673736572, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260062, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259743</a><br>It was but needed a head gasket", "time": 1673737293, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260080, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:07:03", "name": "BigC", "com": "<a href=\"#p26260031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26260031</a><br>I never jumped, read my posts again or learn to read, my post said bounce <br>The other dude who was the boss jumped, he did hundreds more than I ever did so I don&#039;t question him <br>Ball joint and regear time", "filename": "IMG_20230114_150616_108", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673737623692758, "time": 1673737623, "md5": "JMU2klRDNwkQn+PmNqMecg==", "fsize": 259713, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260204, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I refuse to drive my rust free LR3 in the salt, but it did pretty good last blizzard just fucking around.

US has states, we have &quot;wojew\u00f3dztwa&quot; something like provinces. Country is divided in 16 of these, but law is the same everywhere, as Poland is a republic and there is central government in Warsaw) police station. You leave your application there and after few days you can expect background check. Local policeman visits you at home. Will make an interview with you, your family and neighbours (won&#039;t reveal purpose though) and will check history of your crimes (which has to be zero xD).<br>Once he&#039;s done with his paperwork, you will finally get your weapon permit. When you complete this path they cannot deny you. Police gives you certain number of certificates which allow you to buy gun. You can apply for 5, 10, 15 whatever. They usually suggest you how many is best, it depends on the chief of police, how many he&#039;s willing to give at beginning. Those certificates are only way to buy a firearm. Every seller will need them from you, as he has to inform police about selling his gun and return this certificate to the police. You also have to register your weapon within 5 working days since you buy it. It will be noted, with serial number, in a little red book (picrel), that certifies you&#039;re a legal gun owner. You have to carry this book on you anytime you got your weapon with you.<br>Ah... don&#039;t forget to buy safe! It needs to be certified steel safe where weapons and ammo will be kept at all times. Nobody else but permit holder can have keys or combination to it.<br>Important: Whenever you use all your certificates, you can apply for more and you will get them. Your local policeman will come again, check whether all registered gun are still in your posession (better be ;), storage conditions are correct and you&#039;re not beating your wife ;) There are no limits in number of guns.

The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass. Paying over $10 for a sticker is stupid, and that&#039;s ironic because my store will only offer tracked shipping in the future and I apologize for any international orders because shipping is literally going to eat people&#039;s asses.<br><br>- Many things have been on my backlog for a while.

Americans would rather pay twice as much for a bigger vehicle. Rangers are smaller than their wife&#039;s Explorer, only poorfags bought them and companies moved to Transits for fleet vehicles. Eurovans won in this case.<br><br>2. Because Americans want big trucks. For all the bloated dimensions today, most of it is cosmetic. My &#039;85 F-series is a fucking road hog and it doesn&#039;t even have duallies. It&#039;s also hard to control and slides everywhere if you&#039;re not careful shifting. Which speaks to how much better truck transmissions are now and how ECS/ABS has made truck driving easy enough for the layman.<br><br>3. Kei trucks don&#039;t pass emissions or crash testing laws, so they&#039;re defacto banned on that basis alone. American road laws do not consistently make categories for &quot;low speed&quot; vehicles or very small utility vehicles as Japan does. Just in general, Americans want a vehicle that can reliably go on a highway. 4-cyl Rangers have a hard enough time making it to 55 under load, let alone a normal freeway speed at 75. Most people would rather get a bigger truck in this case. Additionally, cabover trucks that do fit all this are much bigger and already sold by Isuzu, often with a full size cargo van and a liftgate.<br><br>4. Americans are fat and have been getting fatter. This is an actual problem, Californians might be able to fit into a Ranger without trouble but when most of your buyers are from Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois your little truck won&#039;t be able to fit one of them let alone two. Note that two &quot;plus size&quot; Americans are equivalent to most Kei trucks&#039; rated payload, so most Americans are literally too fat for JDM vehicles.<br><br>Just look at the popular trucks: Ram 3500s with extra legroom, a step, and multiple assists and integrated bluetooth.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

Muttcars usually have terrible gas mileage and their parts are scarce and expensive compared to other brands. As for the fr*nch, Renault is an unreliable piece if shit, Citroen is just not worth it when you can buy a toyota instead, and peugeot in theory is ok, but it&#039;s fr*nch so fuck it.<br>Name your wallet&#039;s limit as well, some have a limit of 1-3k, others go all in with 10-15k for their first car. Generally, avoid mercedes and bmw if you care about reliability and don&#039;t want to fix electronics every single month. Audi is alright, though once sonething breaks it&#039;s a bit expensive to fix if you&#039;re not doing it yourself; it still is the car that fits your criteria the most though, might want to check the A3. A good all-rounder is <a href=\"#p26271466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26271466</a>, I own one myself and besides regular maintenance nothing needed change after 300k km. If something happens to break, parts are cheap as fuck since it&#039;s all local. It is less luxurious than the audi, but much cheaper too.<br>If for whatever reason vw is not for you, look to the east. Toyota &amp; Honda are the go to if you want reliability, otherwise check out Kia and Hyundai, they have some good shitboxes like the i30 or the veloster for under 10k used. Don&#039;t fall for the Saab meme, it&#039;s a dead company with expensive parts. As for the market, it depends on your country.

Vehicles given here aren&#039;t great so this is definitely one of the last areas to do in the entire DLC lineup when you&#039;re better equipped.<br>2: Vehicles are a gimmick used only largely on this map, but the difficulty is interesting at least with mud/snow mix. I like the verticality of this one.<br>3: One of the better areas for starters because the oversized trailers can actually be used rather well here. Hope you like mud, but probably next to Alaska in ease. Vehicles here are kind of nice.<br>4: It&#039;s Season 1 but with even more dickheaded design. You do get the best superheavy truck on this level to compensate. Just like 1, I wouldn&#039;t come here until you have better equipment.<br>Year 2:<br>5: Distilled bullshit starting off. Not as bad once you get the tempo down and get out some decent ground clearance trucks. Trucks unlocked here are okay but nothing to note since you probably have a decent lineup by now.<br>6: Gimmick is a Hardcore-Lite mode until you progress far enough, in which is just becomes like 2 but easier. Trucks you get here are good but unlock way too damn late.<br>7: Easily and without a doubt the single worst DLC of the game. Not really tough but extremely lacking content and feels like recycled assets from the Dakar game they (then) recently released. Vehicles really only work on this level and nowhere else in the game, and the whole level is so short with content you could 100% it in a session or two.<br>8: Tries to redeem the failure of 7 by adding four massive areas to drive around in.

Personally used it for the GOAT Zikz on Season 4.<br>Jeeps: Mediocre scouts with not much ability, even to haul trailers.

If it was still early on you could argue the Navistar is an unbalanced preorder truck but it too has problems like no diff lock and chugs fuel like a motherfucker. Play it similar to the CAT by slamming it in high on highrange and letting it boulder through terrain rather than sink in.

GM V6 engines are solid like the LFX and LGX. Shouldn&#039;t have any reliability issues. Ford gave V6 engines a bad name unfortunately with their trash V6 engines that they had to scrap them and no longer make any V6 Mustangs. Chevy however uses V6 engines all across their lineup. Then you have the manual transmissions for the Mustang which have been notoriously bad that people recommend the 10 speed auto which is actually a good transmission Ford uses. In your case you want manual so again it&#039;s better to stick with the Cammy Whammy. The V6 makes more horsepower than the Ecoboost and since you&#039;ve found it powerful already no point in downgrading to a more stressed out smaller turbocharged engine. Ecoboost also sounds like dogshit compared to the V6. You won&#039;t get around the fact that it sounds distinctly like a 4 cylinder engine which it is compared to the more muscular sounding V6 engine. Camaro is on the outstanding Alpha Platform chassis too.

When pulling the motor or the trans, you have to drain 7qts out of the coupling and remove the nearly 40 bolts from the flywheel.

Note the difference in alternator mounting for one. Now it could be an L98 under all that other stuff but Occam&#039;s Razor suggests that they simply swung a 90&#039;s 5.0/5.7 TBI truck engine in there as being the simplest explanation.

New tires won&#039;t get here until after I&#039;m already gone for a wedding and I&#039;m not about to ride that bike with wires coming through the rubber. So I pulled my n400 out of storage for my commute. I feel nothing, Infact. I hate the performance. It&#039;s screaming at like 8k just to maintain 85 with a headwind. It feels like I&#039;ve got to redline the motherfucker unless I want to shift 3 gears to get to 25mph. It&#039;s just... While it&#039;s still insanely light and flickable, I twist the throttle and nothing happens. I know it&#039;s faster than a lot of harmble layerrrdowns but compared to what I&#039;ve ridden since, and what I daily now, there&#039;s no magic in the n400 anymore. I really have no regrets selling it now. It&#039;s a bike that&#039;s great at what it does, being entry level and a superb learning bike. The clutch is forgiving, it&#039;s extremely easy to maneuver at high and low speed, but compared to what I own now, I can never go back, it just makes me disappointed to ride.<br><br><a href=\"#p26271883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26271883</a><br>Are you serious?

I do my best to remind myself that they&#039;re designed that way and to ignore any mechanical guilt, but it&#039;s still annoying. I prefer 45-60mph two lanes, but I&#039;m on the east coast and hopping on the interstate for an hour or two often bypasses hours of stop light strip mall stroad hellscape.
