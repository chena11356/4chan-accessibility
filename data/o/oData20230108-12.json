Finally the Codies F1 games and Dirt Rally 2.0 are probably the best &quot;single discipline&quot; racing games but you may get bored of doing the same thing over and over. Whatever floats your boat there. Wreckfest is another really good option for racing something a bit more &quot;random&quot; like shitboxes and lawn mowers but genuinely fun.<br><br>For older games, Race07 is genuinely a great game to play but it is older and you&#039;ll need ALL DLC to have fun.

The AI is complete and utter garbage and even a reasonably slow driver will run circles around them. AMS2 is a scam at best. AMS1 is just reskinned rFactor (2005) and really only good for multiplayer (where it shines). Assetto Corsa Competizione has slightly better AI but the game is just so god damn boring to drive in my opinion and it takes a nuclear reactor of a PC to play. rFactor 2 is kinda ok for singleplayer but only on official tracks. Most usermade tracks confuse the AI and you&#039;ll run circles around them.", "time": 1673091780, "resto": 26222401}, {"no": 26234880, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:47:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26234866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26234866</a><br>You&#039;re not cute", "time": 1673092026, "resto": 26222401}, {"no": 26234887, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:48:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26234880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26234880</a><br>idc about me, i only care about making R4 liveries", "filename": "20829557858557620", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3840, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1673092100399725, "time": 1673092100, "md5": "PX6R6LhM5hdm/uqy3AdcFg==", "fsize": 1597154, "resto": 26222401}, {"no": 26234926, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:02:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26234537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26234537</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AC has the best AI out of all other sims</span><br>lmao, even me a mid tier shitter can outrace 100 percent ac ai on any track with any car, they are dogshit", "time": 1673092945, "resto": 26222401}, {"no": 26235002, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:35:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I may be a retard asking this, but there is any game that allow to play races like split screen, but actually in two different screens?<br>I know I can fake a continuous screen with the graphics controller, just to know if there is any more straightforward support.<br>I need some way to setup for when the boys come home.

But truth be told, the E46 is much more confidence inspiring. It feels a heck of a lot more planted and refined compared to the BRZ. It also helps the the non-M e46&#039;s have comparatively longer wheel bases and are open diff, making them a hell of a lot less twitchy compared to the BRZ. Steering feed back is fantastic due to the nature of hydraulic assist. But that said, the BRZ just feels overall better and more fun, Especially after you do headers and a flash tune to eliminate the dreaded torque dip. That said, if you like small low power cars to throw around, its an absolute riot compared to the e46. Me being fidgety makes throwing the car into gears really fun because of the really short gear ratio. The e46 around town comparatively feels boring because of its longer gearing. Both clutches are lightweight, so traffic isnt an issue, but the e46 also feels a hell of a lot more numb and sluggish. Shift feel in the BRZ is way better, e46 is sloppy like all BMWs of that era Honestly, I&#039;ve been trying to modify the e46 to feel more like the BRZ, and that says something. Seating position on both cars is great compared to other cars. but in the e46 it feels like you sit too damn high and the steering wheel angle makes it feel like you&#039;re driving a semi.The BRZ is perfect out of the box. The seats are comfortable, and the pedals, steering wheel and shifter are all perfectly positioned. I havent tracked the E46 yet, and by the time the car is ready, i feel like it will be too damn heavily modified to give an accurate representation of stock vs stock.. The BRZ has its flaws, but the overall is a way better platform. Its much lighter stock, 2800 vs 3300lbs. And the chassis is stiffer right out of the box. The E46 is the better all rounder and a better daily. The chassis has potential, but its overall structurally too weak for abuse. You&#039;d spend a lot of money reinforcing it and taking weight out of a car is much harder than adding power.", "filename": "IMG_20200717_212458_167", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4020, "h": 4020, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673056020391787, "time": 1673056020, "md5": "hkBW+BOYArJXzqWyJtqyGg==", "fsize": 3383668, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26233638, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:02:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26231029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26231029</a><br>no, buy a car, hoon it around and have fun with it, then rope if you think you&#039;ve had enough<br>alternatively, go for a top speed run and with a department of cops chasing you down, end it with a bang thelma and louise style or wrap around a pole or tree", "time": 1673056940, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26233935, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:42:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Stroked to 2.7L, Holset H1C (laggy but reliable), 14psi of boost. 2.93 LSD, I\u2019ve had it for 13 years now.

Back then I felt like I paid too much for it (especially for a bronzit) but I wanted a fun car again after I sold my 240 for dirt cheap no thanks to a shitty roommate, it was either get rid of the 240 and have a roof over my head or keep it and end up having to find somewhere else to live. It was my daily driver until 2014 and once I boosted it, I barely drive it now. Every once in a while whenever I fire it up and take it for a spin, it takes a beating pretty well like I just drove it yesterday. Had it up to 20psi for several pulls but the clutch started to slip, so I backed it down to 14psi again until I figure out my next move (needs a clutch in that regard and some oil leaks to be taken care of).", "time": 1673120834, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236121, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)14:47:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26234126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26234126</a><br>why the miata hate", "time": 1673120865, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236125, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)14:49:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i bought this beast brand new in 2004", "filename": "garage", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1238, "h": 607, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1673120940868674, "time": 1673120940, "md5": "jjn93Y9ICrqd8yIjt1VJgg==", "fsize": 361656, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236189, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)15:06:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 pig nose </span><br><br>They look much better in person, not a photogenic car", "filename": "8AFEBC51-3756-48FF-9E7C-312CEE31826A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1025, "h": 889, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1673122006339632, "time": 1673122006, "md5": "MGxWbKKY4iCZHnhVb8L4sQ==", "fsize": 412193, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236457, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:35:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Yes, I drive a meme", "filename": "WhatsApp Image 2023-01-06 at 20.02.23", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673127342879354, "time": 1673127342, "md5": "S9P96OM6AQA8fMK+SuK4lQ==", "fsize": 263144, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236475, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:42:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26232413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26232413</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twingo</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Calibra</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Viper</span><br>Congrats anon, you are the most based person on /o/<br><br>Are you a Holl\u00e4nder?", "filename": "Gigachad", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1068, "h": 601, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673127763962929, "time": 1673127763, "md5": "y5Ll5DXOqSba59HdCcfvuQ==", "fsize": 66691, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236497, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:47:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26235943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26235943</a><br>Mean words...", "filename": "20220712_082002", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5760, "h": 4312, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673128074626764, "time": 1673128074, "md5": "TIrFFfn1JFfMTQdFY6m68w==", "fsize": 4133532, "resto": 26230428}, {"no": 26236513, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:51:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Every day I hate my corruption riddled poorfag third world country and my useless self for not working myself to the bone to get the fuck out of here.

That&#039;s 43k USD today. I don&#039;t know where you&#039;re getting $55k from. Nobody was paying $55k for an R34 GTR in 2011. The 80 original UK spec cars that were brought in where \u00a354k when they were new in 1999/2000 (that&#039;s just shy of 100k for inflation) An E46 M3 was between \u00a346-58k when new in 2001. The UK spec cars included a load of differences from a standard V-Spec (on which they were based). They also came with three tuning packages through the dealer (who used to race Nissans in BTCC) with the most expensive being 15k with period HKS and Nismo parts to take the car over 500 horse and maintain the factory warranty (Mitsubishi would later do this for the UK FQ spec Evos through Ralliart).<br><br>R34s never really went below \u00a330k in the UK, because they were supposed to be the last iteration of the GTR until the R35 came along. The only cars that went under that were the cars that were rotted out, heavily modified, or had been crash repaired as already mentioned. My mate&#039;s first R34 GTR was an import in the early 00s. He&#039;d wanted a UK Spec Middlehurst car, but those sold quick. The only reason he could afford to import one when they were new was he was a deep sea welder working on the North Sea oil rigs and they get paid stupid money.
