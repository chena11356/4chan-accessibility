According to the BLS average US price was $0.166 per kWh in October https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest<wbr>/data/AverageEnergyPrices_SelectedA<wbr>reas_Table.htm<br>Elon&#039;s tweet said 1.7kWh/mi as you said, so fuel cost/mi is $0.282, pretty close to the 0.25 you threw out (likely a different assumption on the kWh price.)<br>Diesel also varies in price as de all\u00ed know, and fuel economy can change depending on truck, load, route, etc. 8 mpg is a decent estimate of real world good conditions (and we all know Elon&#039;s figure isn&#039;t for an overweight oversize thru the Rockies) and diesel was a bit over $5/gallon, call ir $5.50. That vives us fuel cost of $0.69/ mile, so yes on paper at today&#039;s pricing a Tesla semi saves quite a bit of money on fuel. <br><br>So long as you don&#039;t need to haul more than 500 miles in a day (or 450 miles next year, 350 miles a few years from now...) and your destinations will all have adequate chargers around (fat chance) then this thing could be an attractive proposition.", "time": 1670251491, "resto": 26136507}], "last_modified": 1670251491}, {"no": 26138108, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:28:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fuck this piece of shit for ruining the market forever", "filename": "Nissan-Qashqai", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1502, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1670250514143380, "time": 1670250514, "md5": "agoA5m+Z6X9EahYpj86IHg==", "fsize": 211809, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fuck-this-piece-of-shit-for-ruining-the-market", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 26138147, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:41:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hated these until I sat in one.
