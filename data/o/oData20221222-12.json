A set of good headers will complete the package. You can also check with World Products. They make some offerings in iron that are a little less pricey than the premium Trick Flows.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

If you&#039;re serious about wanting to join one, IMO the best way to get on one is to go to larger racing events and just get your name out as much as possible. Stop in at tents and ask if they need help with dumb menial shit. Shoot the shit with the guys about the car. This is assuming you sort of know your way around cars already and are not a total sperg. Most will say no, but occasionally, you&#039;ll be in the right place at the right time and you can jam your foot in the door. I know a couple of buddies who got on teams doing stuff like that and they had a blast all summer.

The cost of rent to house all of that shit alone would cost more than I pay a mechanic in a year since I&#039;m not a retard and don&#039;t break my cars. The only time fixing shit yourself is cheaper is when you live out in the country and the mechanic is an hour away and would require a multi-hundred dollar tow and you have a big ass barn already you can carve out a corner of to do car shit with. I live in a city and I&#039;m lucky to have a 1 car garage for my motorcycles and the few tools I do have. Meanwhile, I have amazing mechanics less than 10 minutes away from my townhome. There&#039;s just no reason for me to invest in the shit to DIY when it&#039;s literally cheaper to pawn it on them.

Also, most do it out of necessity because there aren&#039;t many places that even offer repair/building services for drones and RC cars and most PC shops are more geared towards fixing pre-built computers than customizing one.

I have the knowledge to build a PC, but every time I consider it I end up finding a prebuilt on sale that has the same or better parts for less and end up getting that instead. Like the car, I get no enjoyment or satisfaction of putting it together, I only do it if it&#039;s overwhelmingly less expensive or convenient (i.e. I&#039;m not driving to a computer shop to have them swap a graphics card, LOL). In fact, the biggest thing keeping me from upgrading my 1070 to a 3080 right now is because I&#039;d also need to upgrade the power supply and I really don&#039;t want to have to unplug dozens of ports and dig the computer out (almost every port is used and it&#039;s behind my FFB steering wheel setup and other stuff), have to re-reroute all of the cables for a new power supply, hope neither the new power supply or used 3080 have issues, and have to put it all back all to find out the 3080 might be bottlenecked by the rest of the computer.", "time": 1671666537, "resto": 26182659}, {"no": 26185739, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:46:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185596</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In pro racing it&#039;s simply because contact is inevitable.</span><br>Pit crew wrench monkeys take apart every car after a race and rebuild it before the next one in actual pro racing.

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.

This is your life now. I recommend at least a catback and probably headers. Not sure about the NA2s (assuming yours is one and not a facelifted 95-01), but the 3.0 cars are very quiet from factory and slow anyway, so you might as well wake it up and enjoy one of the better-sounding V6s. If you have the cash for a supercharger kit and can find one, I hear the extra few horses make the car not-slow. Turbos make them actually fast, but good luck finding kits for reasonable money.<br>Also: you should either start hoarding parts or praying for a recession, because everything&#039;s ricetaxed through the roof on these, even stock stuff.

No biggie. One of the Chryslers, maybe? I&#039;m not too familiar with Mopar engines unfortunately. Anyway, Ford made a big deal about how new the Modular family was, and rightfully so- the Windsor family had been around since the sixties, and not only was the Mod all-new to bring them out of the malaise era and into a new era that the uber-popular Taurus had kickstarted, but it was, in the public eye, weird. Domestic auto makers in the US just didn&#039;t do V engine overhead cam designs often, outside of snall-run and often partly outsourced designs like the Lotus assisted Chevrolet LT5 or the famous Vulcan V6 based, Yamaha tuned engine in the Taurus SHO- or prototypes that never reached production like the Olds OW43 in the sixties. The Modular was OHC without any pushrod parent to be based on, and they were putting it in their flagship Lincoln sedan from the get go, while the numbers showed it making the same power or even slightly less than the old 302. And of course once it made it to the Mustang, people liked it less because it&#039;s harder to get power out of an N/A Modular compared to a shade tree mechanic and a 302, plus all the missteps it had over the issues it had over time (crack prone plastic intakes replacing the metal ones the Modular originally had, spark plug ejection and a lack of threads, outsourced timing chain guides wearing faster than normal, etc). Still a solid little engine and a regular 2v 4.6 will run to the end of the world so long as it&#039;s kept cool and oiled, but you can kind of tell they went all in on making it reliable and somewhat efficient specifically to overcome the malaise era shittiness even at the cost of the power that most blue oval fans want (which came with the DOHC variants, supercharged Cobra engines, etc., but that wasn&#039;t what Joe Sixpack was getting in his regular Mustang GT.", "time": 1671665885, "resto": 26185389}, {"no": 26185594, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:38:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185508</a><br>Indeed and the coyote is still a modular engine like the 4.6 was", "time": 1671665916, "resto": 26185389}, {"no": 26185636, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:57:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185389</a><br>never", "time": 1671667073, "resto": 26185389}, {"no": 26185952, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:44:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185584</a><br>Its a little different in aviation.

Incredibly simple, yet it works on multiple levels.<br>For one it tests if you have a concept of delayed reward. Reverse parking is slightly more difficult and time consuming than forward parking for a novice. Yet when you come to leave, driving forwards out of a space onto a busy street or parking lot is infinitely easier than backing out and being unable to see what&#039;s coming. The payoff is well worth it.<br>But that&#039;s not all<br>Reverse parking is easier than forward once you practice, but more difficult initially. So it is also a laziness test. Someone who gives no shits about what is better in the long run or improving themselves will always choose the lazy option of badly forward parking because it is &quot;easier and quicker&quot;, and they will spend their entire life doing that.<br>For those that aren&#039;t filtered by the laziness and intelligence test it actually works out even better once you practice due to the way cars turn. While going forwards the rear end follows the front and cuts the corner trailing behind you. You have little control over this. So to forward park properly, you have to swing the front out wide (which you don&#039;t always have room for) so that the rear end can cut the corner and end up in the right place. Most forward parkers are too stupid to realise this, so they end up backing out and in again multiple times or they just leave the car at a stupid angle they initially pulled in at.<br>On the contrary, while going backwards your car becomes rear steering. By thinking ahead you can make very tight turns and still end up placing the rear of the car exactly where it needs to be then correcting the placement of the front of the car in the same motion<br><br>Tl;dr being able to rear-park is a retard test", "time": 1671364524, "resto": 26174170}, {"no": 26176243, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There are a few reasons why backing into a parking space may be considered better than driving into a parking space head-on:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Improved visibility: </span><br>When you reverse park, you have a better view of your surroundings because you are facing the opposite direction.

In a typical traditional engine setup where maybe care about some kind of racing application where acceleration is really the important thing, then neither torque nor horsepower tells you how fast the engine is going to be able to keep turning faster and faster, let alone how that affects the vehicle&#039;s ability to go faster and faster depending on gearing and what range of road speeds you might care about.<br><br>But, as a bit of aphoristic wisdom, it is true that you might hope you can keep the engine engine somewhere in the &quot;power band&quot; (i.e. hoursepower) if you want to maintain a high degree of acceleration or at least high speed where more power is needed to overcome fictional losses like wind resistance the rest. Whereas torque is often the more informative thing when it counts for truck or tractor action where you want to be able to begin acceleration from a lower RPM by being able to impel a lot of force on the drive line to get the vehicle up to speed speed where you&#039;re better able to expend the total work output (power output) capacity of the engine. It&#039;s a bit of a difficult subject if you you&#039;re not a math nerd, but I suspect that he&#039;s making a reasonably correct analogy that torque tells you more about a categorically lower RPM (think a diesel engine that doesn&#039;t typically spin all that fast) vs. a categorically higher RPM (think a gasoline engine where the lighter and faster-burning fuel will tend to expend more of its energy at higher piston speeds.)
