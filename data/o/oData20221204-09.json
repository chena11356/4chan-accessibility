Ive looked at the MSDS and here&#039;s what I&#039;ve come up with (I run an auto business and make my own for the same reason): 20% acetone, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 45% xylene. Make no more than 12 oz per 5 gallons. I say make your own because you need to run some through even AFTER the code turns off. There will still be obstruction in there and it&#039;s best not to do it half assed. Go to a quarter tank, pour it in, and then fill the tank between 5-10 gallons total. Run it through to near E then repeat two more times. Acetone for a gal is like $20, xylene is $26? for a gal, and you only need a large Walmart sized IPA bottle for the 3 mixes.
