It has a silver (the best colour) frame because it was forged in the fires of mount fuji, out of katana steel folded over 100,000 times, sourced from actual world war 2 era katanas. It has a V-four engine; the most bespoke of engine layouts, giving it the peak power of an inline four (commuter car layout), yet the power delivery of a vee twin (outdoor farm equipment engine). It produces 105 PS (claimed) (when new) (at the crank) (without accessories) (at sea level). Combining with this is the most aggressive weight reduction in VFR history: by swapping to a more traditional side exhaust, simplifying the braking system, and using a single radiator, a whopping 0kg was saved for a new wet weight of 240kg (over 0kg lighter than the 4th gen vfr750). The high power and low weight make for an effortless sport touring experience, allowing you to sports, touring, sports whilst touring, tour whilst sporting, and almost any motorcycle usage. VFR stands for Veee Four Racing, and while the \u201cveeeee\u201d sound of the gear cams no longer exists on this generation of engine, you can tell that it was still designed four racing. Lining up against a contemporary CBR1000RR - an almost more expensive motorcycle - the VFR800F was able to achieve a commanding second place in both the drag race and time attack. The veeeffarr\u2019s prowess isn\u2019t just its performance however, its also visually stunning with light emitting diodes for headlights, and finished in a beautiful starfire moonight pearl starlight metallic starmoon white; a white so white the owner must pay extra road tax.

The other half of it is non-Americans coping for their fucked up domestic car market. Thanks to regulations from the government, owning a V8 engine is EXTREMELY expensive in most non-USA countries (like EU, Japan, etc.). So in those countries manufactures avoid them except for their top trim cars where the price is so high the owner can afford all of the heavy displacement taxes. The result is that people who love their EU or JDM cars have to find SOMETHING nice to say about their sports cars that get WORSE mileage and make LESS power yet weigh MORE than a GM V8 sports car. This is where the &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;spirited&quot; memes journos love to spout come from. Who can seriously make an argument for a 350z over a V8 sports car when they cost the same? You can&#039;t. But the thing is the 350z wasn&#039;t meant to win that fight, because it was meant for Japan where American V8 cars are not even allowed to be sold due to the engine size. The funniest part of all is that V8&#039;s like the Vette actually get BETTER gas mileage than inline four jap sports cars. GM has certainly had fuck ups, no denying it, but compare to competitors and you&#039;ll see the same shit. GM has owned and partnered with manufacturers on every continent for decades, they even build some of their cars in the same assembly lines as their competitors that you praise so highly. Just something to think about. There are also examples of utterly stellar engineering and reliability from GM that you all just ignore because it defeats all of your points. I say this as a person who drives a Japanese sports car. Your coping and seething is painful to watch, it&#039;s embarrassing, and you should stop.", "time": 1672971792, "resto": 26229976}, {"no": 26230017, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:24:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26229991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26229991</a><br>Somehow Ford makes engines out of aluminum that do just fine", "time": 1672971850, "resto": 26229976}, {"no": 26230031, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:29:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26229988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26229988</a><br>Are these really that bad?

European emissions requirements only started catching up with American ones in the last ten years or so.

I&#039;m from Texas, and I&#039;m currently living in an EU country. While the rules might be more strict here on paper, they are far less strict in practice where I live. Both my cars have emissions systems deletes (catalyst and DPF in the diesel), which is considered pretty normal and commonplace here. It&#039;s not even hidden, but the cars pass inspection just fine. Actually, one of my cars just started throwing a code (I should probably hook it up to a reader at some point...) and displaying &quot;Antipollution fault&quot; on the information screen right before inspection was due. Local shop didn&#039;t give a shit.

For Americans who are unaware how this works, basically the executive branch of the EU (the European Commission, i.e. Ursala von der Leyen) writes the laws. Then the equivalent of the House and Senate (European Parliament and Council of Europe) get to vote on whether to pass the law. They get to keep voting until they agree that the law is a good idea. Once a law is passed by the EU, every country in the EU is then required to essentially transcribe the law into local law, and local government is expected to enforce those laws. So, for example, the EU has determined that the minimum sales tax in the EU should be 15%, and all EU countries are required to have laws setting sales tax at 15% or above.

If he got a 10 year loan for 170k in 2012-2013 (which would be paid off around this year), he would have had to pay less than 30k in interest. Rates were less than 3% back then. Avoiding paying fully in cash and investing that 170k in something basic like the s&amp;p500 at the time would have yielded over 340k if sold today, even with the downturn.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races.

Back then the main deciding factor of which category a car belonged was based on engine displacement. The Viper being 8.0L was firmly designated for GT1. When the FIA revised their rules for 1997 (mainly to allow for more exotic cars and technology like the CLK GTR), Chrysler had the GTS/R rehomologated for FIA&#039;s GT2. For the US races, they would race under the SCCA&#039;s GT2 category for USRRC races and IMSA/ACO&#039;s GTS category for ALMS. When USRRC gave way to Grand-Am, the GTS/R was in the GTO category until they renamed it GTS (many of the same cars as ACO, but under GARRA&#039;s rules) until Vipers were no longer running in the series. These different categories in different series were basically analogous to FIA&#039;s pre-&#039;97 regs.<br><br>When ACO adopted the FIA&#039;s newly revised GT regs essentially adapting the old GTS and GT classes as new GT1 and GT2, the GTS/R was categorized as a GT1 under the new rules.

The only reason why Porsche got into GT1 in the first place was because their 1995 prototype project fell through and ACO banned them from racing a 962 in a GT category after &#039;94. Instead of complying with the rules of not entering a prototype in a GT class, they would build a new prototype and have the rules changed later and so they came out with the 911 GT1 for &#039;96. They&#039;d win some races in BPR, but because it wasn&#039;t homologated at the time, it didn&#039;t count for any championship points. When the FIA took over BPR and updated the rules, irony Porsche as it was getting beaten at their own game by the new Mercedes and updated McLaren. For most of the program, the car was getting its butt-kicked in FIA GT and could only muster a few non-championship exhibition races. Their only consolation prize was a championship in the national-level BGTC. <br><br>It was in 1998 that they went go-for-broke in the final year of the program and completely revised the car. They still got their ass handed to them in FIA GT (and lost their BGTC crown to a McLaren team), but they did end up winning Le Mans. However to do it, Porsche had to buyout the LMP team that had been beating them over the last two years and &quot;upgrade&quot; their cars. Both would DNF leaving the GT1 cars the sole factory-supported team.

And man does it have more to give. First I&#039;m gonna say one of the biggest improvements aside from the obvious was launch stability. The rear end stayed flat and it felt like both tires had even grip even under a hard launch which is impressive considering the whole open diff thing and the rear sway bar probably does something to help with axle wrap. Now for the obvious, around the corners it stayed perfectly flat with almost no understeer and the throttle input to induce oversteer was far more predictable and importantly consistent allowing me to kick out the rear end counter steer and get the car going the right way. The abundance of right hand turns made this easy to test and get a hang of. My only complaint is the car seems to rock now which kinda sucks going from my glorified boat suspension but the performance gain and the tire wear aspect of not leaning onto the outside shoulders of the tires should make the bullshit all completely worth it. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mfw I hit this right turn at 40 with the most graceful power slide before flooring it away and hitting redline</span>", "filename": "download (1) (7)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 234, "h": 215, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672654164285373, "time": 1672654164, "md5": "FQUnNHhvS60jj1efMrDuwA==", "fsize": 6467, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217133, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212426</a><br>Don&#039;t get a fucking teeter totter one like that bro!", "time": 1672655143, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217408, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)08:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217110</a><br>Noice, it\u2019s always a good feeling when you install mods that actually have a noticeable effect.", "time": 1672667688, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217421, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:06:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216487</a><br>New mustangs are double that.<br>1 less degree of engine tilt equals about 1 and a half degrees of u-joint angle (averaging based on generic suspension height/drivetrain positioning).<br><br>Stupid question...<br>Was the original shaft a 2 piece with slip joint?", "time": 1672668361, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217437, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217421</a><br>3 piece with a matching pocket square", "time": 1672668677, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217482, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217437</a><br>Look into a late model ranger driveshaft.
