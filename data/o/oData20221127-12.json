I have the money, that&#039;s not the problem. At first my previous car was standing in my parking space but I wasn&#039;t allowed to drive it. After a few months I got rid of it. Now the parking space is standing empty and it&#039;s a waste of money. I don&#039;t know why I hesitate so much, why I can&#039;t make up my mind which car to buy. Various reasons I guess, don&#039;t want to go into what it might be. Anyway I think the main thing is that I&#039;m afraid to be stuck with the car that I choose, or that it will end up costing me a lot because it was the wrong choice. But I&#039;ve been wondering, are you actually stuck? How easy is it to change car if you don&#039;t like the one you picked? Can I just pretty much buy any random car and then after a few months sell it and buy another? I had two cars previously, the first one for about 2 years, the second one for almost 4 years.
