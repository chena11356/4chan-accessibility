There was even a time when Volvos went from the pushrod B20 to belt driven OHC and later DOHC while SAAB took it even further and installed a turbo by default. This made no sense at all. Who buys a Volvo to flex with some additional revs? That decision was made by them only because every other Euro manufacturer had gone for OHC/DOHC and the racing style timing belts. Others did this because the consumer demand was what they saw in TV, it was all about racing. People saw a Jaguar, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Mercedes, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Toyota, Subaru. People demanded their car to have some sort of a racing engine. They marketed Fiats, Renaults and Peugeots like this. These classic \u201cracing car\u201d templates are nowhere to be found these days. It simply costs too much money and effort to keep them running. Americans did a smart think keeping the pushrod V8. Unlike many people think, cubic inches only restrict maximum output. Fuel consumption can be very low with the right kind of carburetor or fuel injection even on a 5 liter V8 while a 2 liter Euro/Jap racing engine can burn way more.

Emphasis was on safety and comfort, sporting a padded &quot;safety&quot; dashboard sporting a large instrument pod that combined all gauges in one unit, and a huge interior with fold-down rear seats that could be made into a bed (as such these Nashes were said to be the dread of every teenage daughter&#039;s parents). Performance was not an emphasis, with Nash&#039;s 172 cid I6, making 112 hp at the wheels, being the only drivetrain offered. Nash also boasted of the car&#039;s excellent fuel economy, good for up to 30 mpg, and long range due to the 20 gallon fuel tank (claimed range was up to 500 miles).
