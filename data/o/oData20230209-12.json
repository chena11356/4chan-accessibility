There could&#039;ve been a few more tuners, but it was &#039;DUB Edition&#039; and going more for that blingy theme. V8 Dodge Chargers and Lotus Esprits are definitely not tuners by any means however.<br>The Tokyo setting was also added as an afterthought in Remix and it itself was a rehash of the Tokyo map in MC2, though I found it rather disappointing that you don&#039;t even win any Japanese cars there outside of the Nissan concept car (and the Infiniti G35 technically, though it&#039;s in USDM form)<br>The customization is still top tier, however.

Look up ACTK-fr - I recommend them as the go-to for cars in general since they don&#039;t just collect and reupload them, but add LODs and fix some issues here and there, making them immediately better than what a lot of the original authors post since they can&#039;t bother to optimize their shit, specifically all the asshats that just try to sell their garbage on Patreon, not that there aren&#039;t good (free) car mods to be had on there and other similar sites. There are plenty of street cars and tracks on RaceDepartment, if you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for on either of those sites, look up Totsugeki - mostly Japanese cars and better presentation of what to expect. Assettoland would probably be the next place to check, though IMO it&#039;s kind of a disorganized clusterfuck after it got shutdown like three times for sharing payware cars. As for people on Patreon: Dan Bucsa, MacedoSTI, VR driving, Jerry Wei/\u4f2f\u745c \u9b4f, DanielDi, Just Kapi, etc. You can find a bunch of cars and shit searching on jewtube too. I&#039;d say don&#039;t bother with the Cut Up No Hesi servers unless you really want a specific car and have space, most of the cars in their packs are half-baked garbage, though their traffic pack I would say is the gold standard. Freeroam maps and driving with traffic? Search YouTube. There&#039;s a bunch now, though the best ones that I&#039;ve tried are LA Canyons, Pacific Coast Highway, Union Island, High Force, and Shutoko Revival Project. You&#039;ll have to get into discord servers to get download links to a lot of content too. Touge Union and Kami Trick have some nice content floating around. Currently 2REAL is the best traffic simulation but it&#039;s singleplayer only. If you want to do multiplayer with friends with AI traffic, look up Assetto Server.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support.

A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers. They also outsource the printing like many other vendors (including me), so there&#039;s always going to be blems unless you&#039;re the one handling production or paying them enough money to give enough of a shit.", "time": 1675752309, "resto": 26329663, "trip": "!!VDR3ijdJ5Rz"}, {"no": 26336242, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26336014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26336014</a><br>Idgaf i would rather EVERYONE on the page and just notes or whatever, even if they are outright scams.

The thing is, high end companies should be making hybrids. There is no reason why hybrids should be slow and fuel efficient. They should just have a car that lives up to Mercedes or Porsche specs on the track but that sometimes uses the gas engine to charge the battery, and sometimes uses the battery for more torque and hey, when the battery is low, just fill it with gas and it charges the battery while you drive. It makes the most sense of any possible fuel technology but not one manufacturer is doing it. That&#039;s how you know it&#039;s all a fucking scam. Fucking lemans cars were hybrids like 10 years ago. You can&#039;t tell me they are slow. And Priuses have been on the road for like 20 years already. Now we know they&#039;re cheap and reliable. So what&#039;s the fucking problem? If you&#039;re a fag about the environment, here&#039;s your answer get a hybrid. If you love your mustang or your hellcat but you wish your 0-60 time was just a little faster, here&#039;s your answer get a hybrid.

It would be great for trucks too. But no, everyone wants full ev. For what reason? For what advantage? Literally fucking nothing. And the other thing is, if they actually have half a fuck about the environment they wouldn&#039;t be running fucking car building factors. They would be buying up all cars and reusing everything.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself.

the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

The original FnF was based off a magazine article called &quot;Racer X&quot; that was documenting the real life scene at the time. I&#039;m sure other people were casually racing everywhere else, but that SoCal scene style blew up after FnF.<br><br>I think what killed it, above all else:<br><br>-people freaking out about how dangerous it was despite the fact like 12 people died from it nationwide, which is barely a statistic, and I&#039;ve read those so called &quot;street racing death&quot; articles and it was like a Mercury Mountaineer against an Oldsmobile, like wut?<br><br>-Because of said freakout, cops started being hyper focused on breaking up anything that looked like a meet and enforcing stupid laws meant to target modified cars like headlight height and places like California made basically all engine mods illegal.<br><br>-Cars got too easy to drive and killed the skill aspect of racing. You used to have to have a manual transmission and actually be able to launch and shift. If you showed up with an automatic you were dead in the water unless you massively outclassed the other car in horsepower. Nowadays you just ask the computer to make you go fast and stomp the gas pedal and that&#039;s it and getting a real manual makes you slower.<br><br>-Cheap used cars that were possible to build into something worthwhile got all wrecked and prices shot up. Too few new entry-level sports cars were made to replace them and now we have the situation of today. One nail in the coffin was the late 90&#039;s Japan crash, another was the dot com bubble, then the final one was the 2008 bubble.

As for driving a 328? No. I&#039;m 6&#039; 4&quot; and can&#039;t package sensibly.. The other car mentioned was an old 911. I hated the one I drove and, again, legroom was an issue in the older models. The older cars also have a reputation of falling off the road backwards in a vicious manner if you&#039;re forced to lift off mid-bend - this tendency has been tamed in the later models by the chassis magicians in Weissach, to the point where they now defy physics - although it&#039;s instructive that they moved the engine in front of the gearbox for the 917, and for the racing 911s. I can drive a modern 911 and contemplated one, but the noise from the rear in the cabin on long journeys would have got wearing, so I passed and bought something else.<br>A 30-yo Ferrari would definitely be fragile, as I said.

Then you have the f type r which is more of a sports car alternative to the m850i, m850i is a nice cruiser filled with tech. So in the end OP is right.

The alodine is there mainly for corrosion prevention, not so much paint adhesion. You dont need alodine or the Zinc P. I used it because I had it on the shelf.<br>After the primer dried, I used a Rustoleum white. Not the high temp engine paint, because it was pretty shit, but just the regular stuff. The idea was that if I get any scuffs in the future, the touch up paint would be easy to acquire and match.<br><br>The reason why your valve cover didn&#039;t hold onto the paint was most likely because the surface was too smooth. You&#039;ll have to scuff it. Either blasting or using something like a scotch brite pad or fine sandpaper. Then clean with acetone. After you clean it, avoid touching it with bare hands.<br><br>What was the weather like when you painted? Avoid painting in high humidity. If it&#039;s hot outside, then the paint will dry before it even hits the part if you&#039;re spraying too far away. <br><br><a href=\"#p26338522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26338522</a><br>Literally everyone in aviation uses sandblasting on aluminum parts.

If nobody ever buys new cars, there won&#039;t be any used ones around. Look at the Ford Fiesta. They sold like shit when they were actively being offered by Ford but they are highly in demand used. <br><br>It makes sense. As a consumer why would I buy, probably finance, a new car knowing its going to lose value? Well, if its a car you know you&#039;re going to keep for a long time, it makes to buy new. A sportscar or maybe you bought an SUV to haul the kids arounds whatever. You might buy that new gambling against the future and hey if the interest rate is right you can upgrade it. <br><br>The econobox is different though. The whole point of it is that it&#039;s cheap so why finance one? The idea that you can just work and save up $15-20k and buy one cash is not realistic for most people and hasn&#039;t been since the 70&#039;s. So now if you&#039;re a consumer, you gotta consider that. Why would you finance an econobox knowing full well they made it an econobox by jewing you out of options or having a less powerful engine or whatever. In this case, why eat depreciation if the whole purchase is a cope anyway? You&#039;re probably not really buying what you want; you&#039;re probably acting within a budget and compromising this for that at this price point yada ya. <br><br>All that considered, why the fuck would anybody go out in in 2008 and buy a sedan? For your money, you&#039;re better off with the SUV which yeah maybe its a bit more, but its fuckin huge, has better options, and hey gas in cheap (think 15-20 years ago).

Old, like EURO-0 vehicles, are taxed 420\u20ac, EURO-1 are 210\u20ac and EURO-2 are 120\u20ac. EURO-3 and newer are exempt completely. We call it &quot;ekologick\u00fd (eko) poplatek&quot; or &quot;da\u0148&quot; (fee / tax). I guess it&#039;s meant to motivate people to scrap their old smokey cars instead of selling them to another owner if they no longer need them. It went into effect in 2008, when streets were still full of communist-era \u0160kodas (1000, 120, Favorit), Ladas, Trabants, Wartburgs and Fiats. (No Yugos here, though.) People used to sell them literally for a bottle of booze back then, so the eco-tax made it not worth it. The law remained unchanged until today and it doesn&#039;t really make sense anymore, because EURO-2/1/0 cars are pretty rare today, which actually makes them worth a lot more as oldtimers.<br><br>The MOT is pretty thorough but honestly not very strict, though they sure like to pretend it is. You basically have to show up with a vehicle that moves under its own power, has working lights and brakes and isn&#039;t a complete rust bucket. Part of it is also an emission test where the car has to perform as well as the standard model should. As everywhere, there&#039;s usually very little a bit of backhanded cash couldn&#039;t fix. The sad thing is that an engine swap is a big no-no, which puts lots of people off. Generally, there&#039;s very little car tuning here. A vehicle without valid MOT is unroadworthy.

Plus, it&#039;s showroom clean, don&#039;t want to muck it up. <br>It&#039;s a needy bitch for maintenance, but it&#039;s actually a very reliable bike, I hear from sources. Haven&#039;t read anything that would indicate you need to worry about it breaking down, and many people specifically say how reliable the testastretta engines are. Local shop quoted me $1600 for the 7500 mile service which is timing belt, valve adjustment, air filters, coolant. I&#039;m going to do the service myself when it&#039;s due next. Ducati recommends timing belts to be replaced every 2 years. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s some specific reason why or that&#039;s a generic preventative thing Ducati recommends. Timing belts don&#039;t break down that quick. You can inspect them pretty easily and see when they&#039;re starting to crack, but take that on at your own risk. Other than that, it&#039;s normal oil changes and chain maintenance.<br><br>I would not recommend it as a daily because of the aforementioned, but also the sitting position is super aggressive. My ninja feels very relaxed compared to it, so take that for what it&#039;s worth. However, if you&#039;re in the market for a nice showpiece to take out on occasion, it&#039;s perfect for that.

This is isn&#039;t justt the WRX engine without a turbo. It&#039;s designed around being able to sit lower, use higher static compression, save on weight. Would it be worth the investment for a low-volume car that already struggles to be price competitive?<br><br>Also bear in mind that it uses Toyota&#039;s proprietyary D4 hybrid port/direct injection system. I don&#039;t know what the terms of the technology sharing agreement are, but apparently it was sticky to negotiate as it is, and one would have to wonder if the existing agreement would need to be renegotiated for forced induction or to avoid stepping on a future iteration of the WRX engine or whatever else.<br><br>That&#039;s my guess, anyway. Aftermarket seems to be doing a decent job filling that gap for people who want the platform but with more engine. I don&#039;t particularly expect Mazda to issue a 6- or 8-cylinder Miata even though those are also popular for a certain fringe vs. buying something entierely different.", "time": 1675805337, "resto": 26331273}, {"no": 26337670, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)16:33:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Am I the only one who prefers the 1st gen 86/BRZ?", "time": 1675805598, "resto": 26331273}, {"no": 26337703, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)16:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26337670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26337670</a><br>I didn&#039;t buy it for the looks at all, but the 1st gen brz limited comes impressively close to everything I want in a modern interior, and it&#039;s a looker from the outside to be sure.

Racing engines usually have a camshaft/camshafts that hold the intake valve open longer after the piston reaches bdc and starts coming back up. At higher rpm this is good because you have less time to fill the cylinder and there is a ramming effect that prevents air from flowing back out. At low speed however, later intake valve closing allows some of the air to backflow out of the cylinder. This reduces your dynamic compression, which negatively affects power/torque.
