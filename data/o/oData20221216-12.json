I&#039;m qualified as a mechanic. We do log book servicing which is more than changing oil and filters. When a car is in warranty we check over it for any obvious problems. We only repair warranty things on a customer complaint basis. The services conducted are usually done to a good standard by our techs, if they make a mistake, it is rectified by the dealer straight away while offering the customer a discount on their next service. I don&#039;t think I can think of a time a tech in our dealership stripped an oil pan, I have replaced oil pans because of stripped sump plugs done by other shops though. Generally as a Diag tech I just figure out what&#039;s wrong with a vehicle and advise what&#039;s needed to fix it. I do services when the vehicle is due for a service and has other complaints as well. Yes you pay alot to go to a dealership and there are shit dealerships out there, but mine has a high quality of workmanship because of the techs and management. The foreman won&#039;t release a car unless it&#039;s up to standard. this means fuckups are fixed before they are given back to the customer. Noone is perfect and when your shop has 50 cars a day come through of course there will be mistakes. My wife has a new car in warranty and it goes to the dealer to get serviced. My old LandCruiser gets serviced by me at work because it&#039;s easy. You really do get what you pay for in life. If you go to a budget place paying fuck all for maintenance on your car yeah you are going to get someone who does not give a shit about your car. If you like working on your own car then do it. If you want your car serviced properly then pay someone to do a proper job either at a good shop with a reputation or a dealer with good reviews. But don&#039;t get all high and mighty that you work on your old 88 shit box because you don&#039;t trust a fucking 3rd world immigrant on minimum wage to do an oil change, when you have the same level of skill but put in more of an effort because it&#039;s your own property.", "filename": "20221213_134410", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671177492230977, "time": 1671177492, "md5": "8xU+5T+ETJcuMBKZI5f7kw==", "fsize": 2839539, "resto": 26161064}, {"no": 26169871, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)02:59:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26169865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26169865</a><br>Good looking out, dealerbro.", "time": 1671177597, "resto": 26161064}, {"no": 26169970, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)03:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26162072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26162072</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;let some other monkey get oil everywhere&quot;</span><br>yea so did i. until you realize a mechanic could decide to just change half your expensive oil and pocket the rest.<br><br>i cant afford to trust other people anymore.", "time": 1671180090, "resto": 26161064}, {"no": 26170003, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:01:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26164302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26164302</a>", "filename": "OIL013-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671181304689780, "time": 1671181304, "md5": "X9P4dVKuxI00r2zoNn5JcA==", "fsize": 229418, "resto": 26161064}, {"no": 26170064, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:37:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26169970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26169970</a><br>Find a mechanic you trust.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

I let him go to TCA first to see how it went. We both did undergrad in Japan. He said it wasn&#039;t worth it. He ended up married with 2 kids, divorced, single dad, but more to the point his job is completely unrelated. Hes back in America and is basically using his dad&#039;s money to buy old bars and renovate them into hipster &quot;gastropubs.&quot; I saw pictures of his classes and degree shows for years.

You know how in movies most of the important characters are attractive? Good-looking people exist in real life too, but you&#039;re unlikely to find such a concentration of beautiful people in real life as you do in Hollywood movies. It&#039;s kind of like that with the cars in those movies. Yes, you could see cars on the street like the ones in the movies, but it would be unusual to see so many that take it quite so far as the ones in the movies. For what it&#039;s worth, I consider that style to be more of a 90&#039;s thing than an early 00&#039;s thing, by the way. By the early 00&#039;s, it was already on the way out, and the dotcom crash / small recession around 2002 killed it in the US, imo. For a positive portrayal of that scene, visit your local library and see if they have old copies of Sports Compact Car magazine from the late 90&#039;s.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door. My hope is that between a coolant system flush, a heater core backflush, a new blend door actuator, and a new blend door heat to the cab can be restored.", "time": 1670472295, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26146386, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)23:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>This has to be a troll.

Luckily I&#039;m God&#039;s favourite NPC so the go to bike bits shop had two (almost) universal throttle cable kits that ( were Japanese and) they sold for the price of one because I was wearing overalls and told them I ride a tiny Honda. I say &#039;almost universal because while my throttle housing had one M8\u00d71.25 thread that fitted perfectly the throttle return is a M10\u00d7 1.25 thread, I figured out I could just drill and tap the end of the old cable.

There&#039;s only 2 issues: horrible congestion at peak hours and (((pollution))). Congestion can be solved with more investments into infrastructure. <br>(((Pollution))) can be solved by phasing out the overwhelmingly dominant diesel shitboxes.<br>See, you don&#039;t need to ban cars.

I dunno what to think anymore but I&#039;m pretty tired of it. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s Oculus, but is it maybe Kunos&#039; fault for not providing enough support for the CV1? I mean, other VR games I&#039;ve played run decent to great, so... is it maybe AMD&#039;s fault? Their drivers have kinda been sucking dick lately. Either way, feels bad man.
