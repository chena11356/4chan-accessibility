The use of Monopoly money in the game adds a level of abstraction to the game, allowing players to focus on strategy and decision-making rather than the actual value of money.</span>", "time": 1672728965, "resto": 26220350}, {"no": 26220437, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)02:29:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26220350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26220350</a><br>green bullshit makes cars 100x more complex", "time": 1672730968, "resto": 26220350}, {"no": 26220440, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)02:32:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26220437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26220437</a><br>That&#039;s yet another reason why EVs are so much better.<br>Instead of spending r+d money on dealing with a car&#039;s toxic emissions, manufacturers can spend it on making a better EV.<br>Like the new Porsche 911 for example.<br>Yes it&#039;s an EV but it&#039;s Solid State and it&#039;s a complete game changer and they may finally be able to compete with Tesla.", "filename": "porsche-vision-gran-turismo", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672731157838860, "time": 1672731157, "md5": "vxfZPRaKBc43YhcSBERsiQ==", "fsize": 117181, "resto": 26220350}, {"no": 26220465, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)02:46:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26220440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26220440</a><br>Green emission chasing is retarded.

the paddle shifters are attached to the wheel hub it is very easy to get crossed up and mis-shift.<br>for me the ability to use an h-shifter to drop down multiple gears and be able to accurately shift up in the middle of a drift is key to good drifting. you can do it with paddles it is just much much harder, and you really and truly need a clutch pedal or at least a way to open and drop the clutch to actually be able to control the car mid-drift at all.<br><br>if i may recommend set your steering lock to 540, this prevents you from getting the steering crossed up and will alleviate some of the issues with the paddles. you should be able to go full lock to lock without removing both hands from the wheel. at each end of lock your wrists should basically be touching. then in car setup adjust the front toe to something like -0.30, -0.40, or even less, this is ideal retard drift mode and will let you do very cool drifts without a lot of effort", "time": 1672624431, "resto": 26207332},

also slow you down with kills the momentum and stops the drift.<br>the clutch allows you to cut all torque to the wheels and immediately drop it back on again. the handbrake allows you the additional step of jamming those wheels into a full stop, with causes them to slide like casters, and then you use the normal brakes of the car to -- once the sideways drift has started -- rotate the body about the front wheels which should be in a state of understeer that pulls the car into an arc. you then drop the spinning engine back onto the rear wheels via the clutch once the vehicle is pointed in the direction you want to go, which, provided the alignment is good, should thrust you forward and around the corner like a rocket achieving orbit.<br>without a way to cut the engines momentum off the wheels you cannot rotate the car sideways whilst still moving in a straight line.<br><br>the handbrake is primarily used to aid rotation in small spaces and sharp corners where flicking the car

They have something that translates to &#039;&#039;Luxury Tax&#039;&#039; (literal translation) which states that, any car with an engine equal or bigger than 1.8L of displacement, is considered a luxury and will be heavily taxed. My 4.6L V8 for example would cost me around 4000$ a year in said Tax alone, and we didn&#039;t even touch the Co2 tax yet. Not only that, the Tolls that they pay on their roads are also astronomical. From Thessaloniki to Athens (around 300 miles) you will pay close to 70$ in Tolls. Greece also has a VaT of 24% which is much much higher than, say, Germany for example. Getting to the point, can you guess if Greece has good road infrastructure or not? It&#039;s a rhetorical question, greece has abysmal roads. Greece also, always, has the highest gas prices out of any EU country, because of Taxes.<br>in short, German drivers pay less than 1/3rd for their car than anyone in Greece does, and yet they have ridiculously better roads than greece, why? Greek politicians just eat up the money that&#039;s supposed to go to road infrastructure. Simple as. It happens of course in germany too but to a much much smaller degree.

The power company already has to mandate a device that can remotely disconnect my central air conditioner to shed load if there is a threat of blackouts, so they could do that with my EV charger too if I had one, problem is that at the rate the grid is increasing its capacity they&#039;d pretty much have to fuck a majority of EV users who are charging during the day to keep blackouts from happening and the nightly drops in demand we experience now would basically cease to exist, if EV adoption were to reach the rate desired by policymakers. This is a huge problem, because the other green energy sources; wind and solar, produce basically nothing at night, so all of the load has to fall on other sources. The convenient thing for our crop of authoritarian politicians is that it&#039;s easy to manufacture a crisis this way and limit people&#039;s mobility using EV adoption. You can restrict when they can charge, you can restrict through the smart grid who (geographically, personally?) can charge, and decreasing demand for gasoline will force refineries to shut down, raising the prices of fuel since it will complicate logistics and reduce economy of scale.

BUT the compass &quot;trailhawk&quot; was the biggest peice of shit. The brand new engine burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which I only found out because one day driving down the highway my engine shuts off at 60 mph after a &quot;low oil pressure&quot; warning flashed up for 5 seconds. This happened the first time aound 10k miles. And several times after that despite me pouring a fresh quart in once a month. I was then told that the oil consumption rate was normal by the dealership. Aside from that I had shit break on it constantly. Half the parts are from a fiat 500 and it&#039;s 4wd is actually just AWD. The final nail in the coffin was when my battery died, but it wasn&#039;t actually my battery. It was a very small sub battery that sat on top of my normal battery that INDEPENDENTLY powered the starter motor. So I had a totally fine battery, but because some AA Duracell shit was dead the fucking car wouldn&#039;t start.

And on to of that the C pillars are much wider for the same reason which also doesn&#039;t look good. Many cars for example Camrys have black plastic on the C pillar to make it look like it&#039;s part of the window. once you notice its embarrassing and really really cheapens the car. makes it look like a toy. there are other things. but yea those are the main ones i guess.", "time": 1672623744, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216281, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:12:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Trends, but also safety", "filename": "2023_cadillac_escalade_4dr-suv_premium-luxury_fq_oem_1_1600[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1067, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672625544999682, "time": 1672625544, "md5": "YGOEAbaIFajpJpnAHbdpmg==", "fsize": 199083, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216451, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:31:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mud flaps in front of the front wheels</span>", "time": 1672630273, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216473, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216451</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t do hektik reverse pulls on gravel</span>", "filename": "11235607166_2aa746ef78_b[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672630980086221, "time": 1672630980, "md5": "uTs8noPSXCcTzZVAf0CgDA==", "fsize": 227065, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216652, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:52:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26215422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26215422</a><br>half of car buyers are women, another third are niggers, the rest are men with micropenis.

Alternatively they go to some destination/place first with their motorcycles and after parking their motorcycles they keep wearing the motorcycle clothes until they return into their homes. Wearing full motorcycle clothing is always recommended when ever you ride a motorcycle even at slow speeds or short distance because those clothes can save you from death or serious injuries. You can die two way one is sudden stop, second that is more painfull is sliding to death from high speed because after you hit the ground the road begins grinding your body to the road in similar way like sandpaper vs piece of wood.<br><br>You can die from crashing a heavy motorcycle even from standstill which is quite rare, but it possible to happen.

And man does it have more to give. First I&#039;m gonna say one of the biggest improvements aside from the obvious was launch stability. The rear end stayed flat and it felt like both tires had even grip even under a hard launch which is impressive considering the whole open diff thing and the rear sway bar probably does something to help with axle wrap. Now for the obvious, around the corners it stayed perfectly flat with almost no understeer and the throttle input to induce oversteer was far more predictable and importantly consistent allowing me to kick out the rear end counter steer and get the car going the right way. The abundance of right hand turns made this easy to test and get a hang of. My only complaint is the car seems to rock now which kinda sucks going from my glorified boat suspension but the performance gain and the tire wear aspect of not leaning onto the outside shoulders of the tires should make the bullshit all completely worth it. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mfw I hit this right turn at 40 with the most graceful power slide before flooring it away and hitting redline</span>", "filename": "download (1) (7)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 234, "h": 215, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672654164285373, "time": 1672654164, "md5": "FQUnNHhvS60jj1efMrDuwA==", "fsize": 6467, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217133, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212426</a><br>Don&#039;t get a fucking teeter totter one like that bro!", "time": 1672655143, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217408, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)08:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217110</a><br>Noice, it\u2019s always a good feeling when you install mods that actually have a noticeable effect.", "time": 1672667688, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217421, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:06:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216487</a><br>New mustangs are double that.<br>1 less degree of engine tilt equals about 1 and a half degrees of u-joint angle (averaging based on generic suspension height/drivetrain positioning).<br><br>Stupid question...<br>Was the original shaft a 2 piece with slip joint?", "time": 1672668361, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217437, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217421</a><br>3 piece with a matching pocket square", "time": 1672668677, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217482, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217437</a><br>Look into a late model ranger driveshaft.

Up until the 1990s, the luxury car market was dominated by the Germans and the occasional bong brand. It&#039;s not that their was complacency amongst the dominant luxury brands, competition between them existed but their wasn&#039;t much incentive to innovate either.<br>BMW and Mercedes mostly kept to themselves. Audi and Porsche were their entirely own niche and British cars really only appealed to a more affluent and masochistic clientele. American luxury cars were the Teslas of their age; tons of technology and gimmicks with no real quality control; see Cadillacs with the Northstar as an example.<br>The arrival of Lexus really did change everything. It wasn&#039;t the first Japanese brand to take on the establishment but it was the first to supersede it. The Acura Legend was not impactful to the Germans; the LS400 was.<br>The LS in its debut was the best flagship sedan one could buy... for about two years. The LS set the gold standard for what a modern luxury sedan should be. Mercedes perfected it.<br>The W140&#039;s over engineered philosophy was a response to both the E32 and the LS. It was the W140 which would define the era of luxury, not Lexus. With the W140 dethroning the E32, BMW ushered an arguably even more insane car, the E38. The E38 was ahead of its time in almost every measure. It was the car of the 2000s produced in the early 1990s.<br>American brands did not sit idle. Lincoln perfected the luxury formula with the first Panther based Town Car in 1997. Cadillac... attempted. At least they kept the styling. Jaguar, under the influence of Ford pushed for experimentation and revived the S Type nameplate while introducing the X Type. So and so forth.<br>Suffice to say, the constant competition and wider variety of luxury offerings created a market which was not oversaturated, rather a market where every option was respectable and understandable. Every car had a merit for existing and manufacturers had to constantly compete and innovate to justify that merit.", "filename": "gold_standard", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125,

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA.

Back then the main deciding factor of which category a car belonged was based on engine displacement. The Viper being 8.0L was firmly designated for GT1. When the FIA revised their rules for 1997 (mainly to allow for more exotic cars and technology like the CLK GTR), Chrysler had the GTS/R rehomologated for FIA&#039;s GT2. For the US races, they would race under the SCCA&#039;s GT2 category for USRRC races and IMSA/ACO&#039;s GTS category for ALMS. When USRRC gave way to Grand-Am, the GTS/R was in the GTO category until they renamed it GTS (many of the same cars as ACO, but under GARRA&#039;s rules) until Vipers were no longer running in the series. These different categories in different series were basically analogous to FIA&#039;s pre-&#039;97 regs.<br><br>When ACO adopted the FIA&#039;s newly revised GT regs essentially adapting the old GTS and GT classes as new GT1 and GT2, the GTS/R was categorized as a GT1 under the new rules.

The only reason why Porsche got into GT1 in the first place was because their 1995 prototype project fell through and ACO banned them from racing a 962 in a GT category after &#039;94. Instead of complying with the rules of not entering a prototype in a GT class, they would build a new prototype and have the rules changed later and so they came out with the 911 GT1 for &#039;96. They&#039;d win some races in BPR, but because it wasn&#039;t homologated at the time, it didn&#039;t count for any championship points. When the FIA took over BPR and updated the rules, irony Porsche as it was getting beaten at their own game by the new Mercedes and updated McLaren. For most of the program, the car was getting its butt-kicked in FIA GT and could only muster a few non-championship exhibition races. Their only consolation prize was a championship in the national-level BGTC. <br><br>It was in 1998 that they went go-for-broke in the final year of the program and completely revised the car. They still got their ass handed to them in FIA GT (and lost their BGTC crown to a McLaren team), but they did end up winning Le Mans. However to do it, Porsche had to buyout the LMP team that had been beating them over the last two years and &quot;upgrade&quot; their cars. Both would DNF leaving the GT1 cars the sole factory-supported team.

You mostly change your driving style to compensate so people dont honk at you.

A total basketcase 4cyl nonturbo with broken automatic may take 30-40s to reach 60mph if it does get there. With properly tuned motor and transmission you can floor it, spool boost, and keep up with modern econoboxes and usually pass traffic.

But for people who like forevercars, that&#039;s a reasonable cost, and they run the cars very cheaply once paid off since most normies spend several hundreds of thousands, approaching over a million rotating through new cars/trucks every few years.", "time": 1672626113, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216558, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26202075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26202075</a><br>2002*", "time": 1672633009, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216979, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:29:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26202058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26202058</a><br>I&#039;ll take the fucking plastic jfc", "filename": "Josh TSX", "ext": ".png", "w": 1791, "h": 867, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1672648163440260, "time": 1672648163, "md5": "85crn4lhDssJwXIZtOH84Q==", "fsize": 94382, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216988, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:39:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "isn&#039;t it a funny coincidence that whenever volkswagen wants to make a car, it&#039;s always a piece of shit?<br>literally every good car to come from them, apart from maybe the golf, actually came from somebody outside of volkswagen", "filename": "bugatti-veyron-super-sport-", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 770, "h": 523, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1672648751332169, "time": 1672648751, "md5": "JuKmeUt1MxjWlR8J/+tSsA==", "fsize": 261429, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26219323, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)20:44:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216979</a><br>unbelievable to be miles, so if it&#039;s km it would be 372k mi.

red light and hammered the Fiero on the driver&#039;s side front wheel and pretty much ripped the entire front end off, sending the Fiero spinning like top and bouncing three times while red plastic rained down on my car as we slowly rolled thru the intersection.<br><br>I pulled into a party store parking lot (what we call convenience stores here in MI) and my buddy and I ran out to the Fiero expecting the driver to be gruesomely dead but he had his seatbelt on and was just stunned a bit (he had broken out the driver&#039;s side window with his head) and got out of the Fiero to look at it, when the Chevette driver came over and apologized (he was unhurt).<br><br>I was interviewed by cops (but not my buddy, he was still 17 at the time) and despite them obviously smelling the beer on my breath, they didn&#039;t give me any shit and a few weeks later, the Fiero driver&#039;s lawyer called and said the Chevette driver had been drunk and would I be willing to testify in court, to which

The security systems of EV&#039;s draw the power from the 12v circuit. <br>The other problem is wire and circuit management. A bunch of wires together can still radiate power between each other like electromagnetic fields, and higher voltage systems can destabilize fixed electro radiation frequencies of lower voltage direct current systems. The problem is the EV car have two direct current circuits with near the same amp loads for their voltages. Overloading amps is the same as sparking wires, and those sparking wires are melted solder after they are done. If there is no safety fuse or controller to cut off that, then the amp overload will cycle though the battery and then boom. The problem about that safety shutoff is your car and it&#039;s by wire system will no longer operable. <br>The problem is EV&#039;s have two voltage systems on the platform, so the cause is most likely electromagnetic radiation form the higher voltage getting into the lower voltage wires.
