Plus, it&#039;s showroom clean, don&#039;t want to muck it up. <br>It&#039;s a needy bitch for maintenance, but it&#039;s actually a very reliable bike, I hear from sources. Haven&#039;t read anything that would indicate you need to worry about it breaking down, and many people specifically say how reliable the testastretta engines are. Local shop quoted me $1600 for the 7500 mile service which is timing belt, valve adjustment, air filters, coolant. I&#039;m going to do the service myself when it&#039;s due next. Ducati recommends timing belts to be replaced every 2 years. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s some specific reason why or that&#039;s a generic preventative thing Ducati recommends. Timing belts don&#039;t break down that quick. You can inspect them pretty easily and see when they&#039;re starting to crack, but take that on at your own risk. Other than that, it&#039;s normal oil changes and chain maintenance.<br><br>I would not recommend it as a daily because of the aforementioned, but also the sitting position is super aggressive. My ninja feels very relaxed compared to it, so take that for what it&#039;s worth. However, if you&#039;re in the market for a nice showpiece to take out on occasion, it&#039;s perfect for that.

Old, like EURO-0 vehicles, are taxed 420\u20ac, EURO-1 are 210\u20ac and EURO-2 are 120\u20ac. EURO-3 and newer are exempt completely. We call it &quot;ekologick\u00fd (eko) poplatek&quot; or &quot;da\u0148&quot; (fee / tax). I guess it&#039;s meant to motivate people to scrap their old smokey cars instead of selling them to another owner if they no longer need them. It went into effect in 2008, when streets were still full of communist-era \u0160kodas (1000, 120, Favorit), Ladas, Trabants, Wartburgs and Fiats. (No Yugos here, though.) People used to sell them literally for a bottle of booze back then, so the eco-tax made it not worth it. The law remained unchanged until today and it doesn&#039;t really make sense anymore, because EURO-2/1/0 cars are pretty rare today, which actually makes them worth a lot more as oldtimers.<br><br>The MOT is pretty thorough but honestly not very strict, though they sure like to pretend it is. You basically have to show up with a vehicle that moves under its own power, has working lights and brakes and isn&#039;t a complete rust bucket. Part of it is also an emission test where the car has to perform as well as the standard model should. As everywhere, there&#039;s usually very little a bit of backhanded cash couldn&#039;t fix. The sad thing is that an engine swap is a big no-no, which puts lots of people off. Generally, there&#039;s very little car tuning here. A vehicle without valid MOT is unroadworthy.

I hated the one I drove and, again, legroom was an issue in the older models. The older cars also have a reputation of falling off the road backwards in a vicious manner if you&#039;re forced to lift off mid-bend - this tendency has been tamed in the later models by the chassis magicians in Weissach, to the point where they now defy physics - although it&#039;s instructive that they moved the engine in front of the gearbox for the 917, and for the racing 911s. I can drive a modern 911 and contemplated one, but the noise from the rear in the cabin on long journeys would have got wearing, so I passed and bought something else.<br>A 30-yo Ferrari would definitely be fragile, as I said.

I&#039;m debating what was the reasonable thing to do.<br><br>To many, the Mini driver was an asshole for slamming the brakes too early on Yellow, and many drivers would not expect that to happen. This will only be an annoyance if you didn&#039;t tailgate and had enough time to stop or change lanes (our situation with the SUV), or absolutely dangerous if the driver behind was tailgating and had no time to brake or switch lanes.<br><br>Meanwhile, the trucks didn&#039;t do anything illegal, probably, but the front truck made a needlessly wide turn in the middle lane when the turn could have been done no problem completely on the right lane. In addition, the pole was blocked from the view of the SUV driver, so the SUV driver made the most likely and reasonable assumption that the front truck driver wasn&#039;t doing something stupid in the middle lane. In the perspective of the SUV driver, the middle lane was clear.<br><br>Also the SUV driver was already well in front of the chase vehicle that was already almost in the right lane, so why would anyone assume that the front truck was still hugging the middle lane.

There could&#039;ve been a few more tuners, but it was &#039;DUB Edition&#039; and going more for that blingy theme. V8 Dodge Chargers and Lotus Esprits are definitely not tuners by any means however.<br>The Tokyo setting was also added as an afterthought in Remix and it itself was a rehash of the Tokyo map in MC2, though I found it rather disappointing that you don&#039;t even win any Japanese cars there outside of the Nissan concept car (and the Infiniti G35 technically, though it&#039;s in USDM form)<br>The customization is still top tier, however.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on. Yes, I&#039;m waiting for someone to mention how ironic this is coming from me and my previous fuck up handling order fulfillment, but that&#039;s way beyond the point. <br><br>I understand your frustration, Taiyo and I look at other vendor&#039;s behaviors (and even my own) and try to avoid either repeating mistakes or going down a similar path someone else did. In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support. I&#039;ll repeat, this isn&#039;t a hit piece on them or any other vendor specifically, but you&#039;ll know what to watch out for when you see it enough times.<br><br>Again, I think keeping them is beneficial (unless for reasons including but not limited to the aforementioned for removal).

Again, I&#039;m completely on board with you. If enough people point out that there&#039;s an issue with someone or if there&#039;s evidence of foul play then we&#039;ll take care of it because we don&#039;t want people throwing away their money because we didn&#039;t clean up the site. Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely. A fierce battle ensued between the two cars, but in the end the F40 took the chequered flag in 1st place.", "time": 1675661793, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26332859, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They ended the 1994 season on a strong note but the following season however, the F40 was unable to perform to its full potential due to the full scale support for Japanese works cars and the introduction of new regulations.

The thing is, high end companies should be making hybrids. There is no reason why hybrids should be slow and fuel efficient. They should just have a car that lives up to Mercedes or Porsche specs on the track but that sometimes uses the gas engine to charge the battery, and sometimes uses the battery for more torque and hey, when the battery is low, just fill it with gas and it charges the battery while you drive. It makes the most sense of any possible fuel technology but not one manufacturer is doing it. That&#039;s how you know it&#039;s all a fucking scam. Fucking lemans cars were hybrids like 10 years ago. You can&#039;t tell me they are slow. And Priuses have been on the road for like 20 years already. Now we know they&#039;re cheap and reliable.

And the other thing is, if they actually have half a fuck about the environment they wouldn&#039;t be running fucking car building factors. They would be buying up all cars and reusing everything.

Racing engines usually have a camshaft/camshafts that hold the intake valve open longer after the piston reaches bdc and starts coming back up. At higher rpm this is good because you have less time to fill the cylinder and there is a ramming effect that prevents air from flowing back out. At low speed however, later intake valve closing allows some of the air to backflow out of the cylinder. This reduces your dynamic compression, which negatively affects power/torque. Choppy idle is a bit different and usually dependent on the amount of overlap. Cams with a lot of overlap struggle to idle smoothly and make vacuum because of intake charge going out the exhaust instead of filling the cylinder.", "time": 1675815807, "resto": 26331273}, {"no": 26338107, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)19:23:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26338086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26338086</a><br>It depends when the exhaust valves open relative to the piston, combustion event, and what&#039;s happening on the intake side.

Do without a map to increase your street knowledge and force yourself to think a bit. Look at and recognise different areas, styles of houses, layout, etc etc and come back to nice areas id you feel like it. Alternatively, driving to / between / around industrial areas outside of work hours - cityscapes can be quite pretty and interesting sometimes. No one around is also a bonus. Can go from anywhere from half an hour to three hours depending. <br>Drive to the lookout / quarry / old school / parks I used to frequent and go for a walk if I want to move a bit more. Time to think and reminisce, and have a nice view too. Probably go for an hour or two.<br>Go through the hills out to the country - relaxed roads, new places, very quiet, can zone out and just cruise. Gives you time to think if you want, or just to get away from the city and the rat race and have some time to yourself away from people and responsibilities. No one knows you and no one judges you.

Making your car look more like an anime or video game car isn&#039;t any different than those fags on /k/ who buy meme wraps for their rifle, or anything else. Most 80s cars were nothing better than an appliance and a lot of these meme shitboxes are built like the cheapest toaster you can find on Amazon. OOHHH maybe it had a decent budget engine and steering rack maybe but its not built to last and treating it like an heirloom is retarded.<br>Me and my friends drilled holes through the trunk cover of a Geo Metro to install a functional bathroom sink on the back of one of our shitboxes. Have fucking fun with your car, especially if it&#039;s a shitbox.

On the car tablet, there is no such separation, as every element is still part of the same glass screen.<br>Another aesthetic value is restraint - not using more effort than you need to. if you are using pixels, screens and electricity for something that can be done just as well, and even more delightfully, with a simple hardware stick, you are overdoing it, trying too hard.<br>A final principle of aesthetics is authenticity, genuineness. By its very nature a screen constantly shifts and moves, it&#039;s an illusion, a lie.
