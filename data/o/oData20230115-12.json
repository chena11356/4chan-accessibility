Vehicles given here aren&#039;t great so this is definitely one of the last areas to do in the entire DLC lineup when you&#039;re better equipped.<br>2: Vehicles are a gimmick used only largely on this map, but the difficulty is interesting at least with mud/snow mix. I like the verticality of this one.<br>3: One of the better areas for starters because the oversized trailers can actually be used rather well here. Hope you like mud, but probably next to Alaska in ease. Vehicles here are kind of nice.<br>4: It&#039;s Season 1 but with even more dickheaded design. You do get the best superheavy truck on this level to compensate. Just like 1, I wouldn&#039;t come here until you have better equipment.<br>Year 2:<br>5: Distilled bullshit starting off. Not as bad once you get the tempo down and get out some decent ground clearance trucks. Trucks unlocked here are okay but nothing to note since you probably have a decent lineup by now.<br>6: Gimmick is a Hardcore-Lite mode until you progress far enough, in which is just becomes like 2 but easier. Trucks you get here are good but unlock way too damn late.<br>7: Easily and without a doubt the single worst DLC of the game. Not really tough but extremely lacking content and feels like recycled assets from the Dakar game they (then) recently released. Vehicles really only work on this level and nowhere else in the game, and the whole level is so short with content you could 100% it in a session or two.<br>8: Tries to redeem the failure of 7 by adding four massive areas to drive around in.

It&#039;s an okay performing truck but I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s mandatory or good except if you want to be a completionist.<br>Chevy Apache: Similar to the Navistar in that it&#039;s like a truck you will get later on (YAR in vanilla) unlocked earlier to dominate early game.<br>CAT CT681/International HX 520: Arguably the best premiums because of being free, they make excellent support trucks.

Will fuck you if you play Hard mode due to the extra maintenance costs.<br>Tatra 813/805: You&#039;ll get this one automatically on buying the Year 1 pass. 805 makes for a very good heavy offroad truck until you get a larger toolset to use. Personally used it for the GOAT Zikz on Season 4.<br>Jeeps: Mediocre scouts with not much ability, even to haul trailers. Might be fine in light dirt but are very useless to do anything serious.<br>Crocodile: Makes for a good resupply truck, one of the better premiums actually.

If it was still early on you could argue the Navistar is an unbalanced preorder truck but it too has problems like no diff lock and chugs fuel like a motherfucker. Play it similar to the CAT by slamming it in high on highrange and letting it boulder through terrain rather than sink in.

Mine needs a battery so the start/stop isn&#039;t working (really common issue with these, the stock batteries only last 2-3 years for some reason) and it might be a bit better with that fixed as well, people on the forums say it actually makes a couple of MPG difference on the Ranger.<br><br>Other than that I&#039;m really happy with it.

Mine came from them and it was relatively high mileage for the year but exceptionally well-maintained, no bullshit upsells or anything from the dealer, and they&#039;ve got really good no-haggle pricing, I got the top of KBB for my trade and well under KBB on the truck and didn&#039;t have to fight for it at all.", "time": 1673764400, "resto": 26247618}, {"no": 26261454, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:41:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26247618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26247618</a><br>Hurt me, I know you all fucking hate the Dodge version of this<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2 liter diesel mapped to 210hp</span>", "filename": "72A146B8-8F2F-423C-B1AC-616942F2CF38", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673768461445362, "time": 1673768461, "md5": "wA3QAGvYyzPmL/PvEr2MPQ==", "fsize": 486279, "resto": 26247618}, {"no": 26261484, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:00:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I will never financially recover from this and I&#039;m alright with that.", "filename": "20221106_143703", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1887, "h": 1352, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1673769659186910, "time": 1673769659, "md5": "rcbGLCXxk9MQ/agygD1UIQ==", "fsize": 1856181, "resto": 26247618}, {"no": 26261541, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:47:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26247618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26247618</a><br>Mercedes W 206 C Class", "filename": "EAC20730-A25B-41F2-8BCC-1BF042FA9AFE", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673772478208441, "time": 1673772478, "md5": "uCOTOxLDRZivcouDMdFE2Q==", "fsize": 264665, "resto": 26247618}, {"no": 26261545, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:53:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26254141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26254141</a><br>I had it before I got the Elise, as a track/autocross car.

Place the boards in their fully deployed position. In most cases, it may be easier to remove the motors from the motor linkages to allow the steps to fully deploy, and proceed with the rest of the process.<br>2. Verify that the pinch weld holes are lining up with the holes for the linkages. You may need to enlarge the holes in the pinch weld if they do not line up or are catching the bolt threads as you install the steps.<br>3. Verify that the rear of the running board is flush with the rear linkage. If it is not, adjust the running board forward so that the end cap is flush with the linkage.<br>4. Make sure that ALL HARDWARE IS TIGHTENED PROPERLY.<br>5. Have someone walk the length of the board, taking bouncing steps or shifting their weight up and down as they walk. DO NOT JUMP on the running boards. Only shift your weight up and down while moving the entire length of the running board, like you are performing a suspension check.<br>6. With the boards still in the down position, loosen the button head Torx head bolts that go through the pinch weld. DO NOT loosen the hex head bolts on the back of the rocker panel. Then, either have someone sit on the center of the board or put some weight on the center of the board. While there is weight on the board, retighten the button head bolts going through the pinch weld.<br>7. Remove the weight from the board, and try moving the board up to the completely stowed position. Check to see if the board clears the pinch weld. If it clears, reinstall the motors and complete the installation. In some cases where the pinch weld is more uneven, you may need to do this complete procedure a second or third time. If the step still does not clear the pinch weld after several seating attempts, please continue on to Step 8.", "time": 1673734812, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260031, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:49:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259965</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DO NOT JUMP</span><br>Meth is one hell of a drug.", "time": 1673736572, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260062, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259743</a><br>It was but needed a head gasket", "time": 1673737293, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260080, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:07:03", "name": "BigC", "com": "<a href=\"#p26260031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26260031</a><br>I never jumped, read my posts again or learn to read, my post said bounce <br>The other dude who was the boss jumped, he did hundreds more than I ever did so I don&#039;t question him <br>Ball joint and regear time", "filename": "IMG_20230114_150616_108", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673737623692758, "time": 1673737623, "md5": "JMU2klRDNwkQn+PmNqMecg==", "fsize": 259713, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260204, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I refuse to drive my rust free LR3 in the salt, but it did pretty good last blizzard just fucking around.

Most planes with these systems usually have either a basic set of traditional gauges as a backup or a separate small digital instrument like a Garmin G5 that can show all the critical info and has its own battery and sensors.", "filename": "attitude-indicator-diagram-small", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 667, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673765553529328, "time": 1673765553, "md5": "SBtIoTNGoe6jVOUhshyPFA==", "fsize": 128008, "resto": 26254004}, {"no": 26261392, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)01:53:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26254078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26254078</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dies because of a 5kt crossbreeze</span>", "time": 1673765584, "resto": 26254004}, {"no": 26261400, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:00:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26255466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26255466</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GA is based</span><br>GA is like Ham radio turned up to 11.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

only made 115hp and 150hp in the 16v version. In the MK4 Golf GTI with the N/A 2 litre petrol it only made 115hp. The N/A 1.8 litre 20v made 125hp. The Ford Focus Zetec with the 2 litre petrol of the same era only made 130hp as well. The Focus ST170 with the 2 litre petrol was 170, which was the same as the JDM market 323. The Clio 172 was... 172hp with a 2 litre. The Clio 182 was... 182hp with a 2 litre. But the Clio RenaultSport and ST170 were the top of the food chain hot hatches (the ST170 was touched by Cosworth). We didn&#039;t even get the 170hp version of the 323 in the UK. And normally the Japs will send us the hot shit and get frustrated when we want more power. The MG ZS was making 180 out of a 2.5 litre V6. The MG ZR with the 1.8 VVC was making 160. The Proton Satria GTi (a mates brother had one of these) which used a 1.8 4G93 was touched by Lotus and made about 140hp. <br><br>At the time manufacturers were beginning turbo to make high horse power more easily. The 1st gen Focus RS was tubro&#039;d and made 210ish hp. The 1.8T 20v from VAG made 180. The 2 litre 16v in the Fiat Coupe made 180. The 20v made 220.<br><br>TL;DR = 130hp from an N/A 2 litre at the end of the 90s / early 00s wasn&#039;t actually that bad. If you wanted more you needed the likes of Cosworth or RenaultSport to breath on your motor. Or MazdaSpeed.
