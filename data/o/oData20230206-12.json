Manufacturers sell to dealerships who in turn have to pay a loan on the vehicle to the manufacturer in the time it sits on its lot. <br><br>Therefore manufacturer makes money both on the sale of the vehicle to the dealership + the interest paid by the dealership to the manufacturer, and has the additional bonus of the manufacturer dealing with a couple of hundred dealerships vs hundreds of thousands of people.<br><br>Getting rid of this means the manufacturer loses money, as they lose the interest paid and now have to pay for customer service + service centers (See #3)<br><br>2. Selling to dealerships means that there&#039;s a buffer in sales if there&#039;s an economic down turn. If the economy goes tits up, Ford or Honda doesn&#039;t have to layoff their employees, paying them either severance (as most of these operations are unionized) or their unemployment insurance gets jacked up. Either way the company has to pay out through the nose for little or no production if they shut down. If they can keep sending units to their dealerships they avoid this. <br><br>Which also refutes your dumb idea that it would facilitate more sales to customers, If the economy goes tits up, then the manufacturers would make LESS sales than with the dealership network in place. <br><br>3. Service centers cost money to operate, and having dealerships burden the cost, whilst charging them access to the manufacturers parts network Means they don&#039;t have to pay for brick and mortar overhead (which if you had one iota of business knowledge you&#039;d know is fucking expensive) and employing services techs and again still making money off of OEM parts sales. <br><br>4.

I\u2019m not a fag to them though, I pay their fees and am friendly with the desks and mechanics. <br><br>Not saying I\u2019m special but pointing out that it\u2019s not a guarantee they\u2019ll deny the warranty. <br><br>Also, I had an S3 running 400hp for a while (again warrantied through Audi dealer no problem). IMO the A4/S4 is better than the S3/A3. The Quattro system in the A4 (ultra) and the S4 (crown/torsen) is worth paying for. <br><br>Quattro ultra has the detached rear axle when you don\u2019t need awd. Audi noticed it\u2019s A4/Q5 customers were thinking in terms of \u2018gee AWD uses more gas so maybe I\u2019ll get FWD and stay home if it snows\u2019 instead of thinking about sporty ness. Since torsen uses .6L of fuel extra per 60km Quattro ultra uses .2L and so it offers the best of both worlds for customers that were torn on Quattro. It\u2019s also exoerimxe better than torsen in the snow/ice as ids faster to get torque where it needs to go. <br>Haldex sucks bad. The engine is all forward of the front axle. It barely sends power rear except in extreme situations and the worst part is it breaks in as little as 10k miles. The A4 ultra is fwd biased like Haldex but the weight is minimal, the engine is mroe rear, the system is much more siphsitaced in terms of engaging the clutch and it\u2019s much more robust and has no issues with reliability. <br><br>The nice thing about the A4 is the current 4 cylinder is very reliable and the water pump meme is covered by a recall. I doubt you have warranty issues to worry about. Since Audi puts engines on the front axle a 4 cylinder is ideal because it\u2019s compact and weighs little so the A4 has a good argument for handling the best. <br>Order an 034 Motorsport rear sway bar and you\u201dll have a very neutral handling car with great awd and a DCT.", "time": 1675352920, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320963, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:54:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320947</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a tuned S6 running bunkers numbers and fully modified suspension and my dealer loves the car and always run my warranty</span><br>just to clarify, you have an S6 that you&#039;ve tuned extensively, broke something in your drivetrain, and they warrantied those repairs? what kind of powertrain repairs did they perform under warranty with your tune?", "time": 1675353258, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320970, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320813</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no r8 for me then</span><br><br>imagine my reaction when i found out the hard way", "filename": "dont", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 231, "h": 218, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1675353346580871, "time": 1675353346, "md5": "7ymVmCpXCYP2C1Vm5r2zNg==", "fsize": 5681, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320973, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320963</a><br>The S3 they replaced the Haldex and rear bumper.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely. A fierce battle ensued between the two cars, but in the end the F40 took the chequered flag in 1st place.", "time": 1675661793, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26332859, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "They ended the 1994 season on a strong note but the following season however, the F40 was unable to perform to its full potential due to the full scale support for Japanese works cars and the introduction of new regulations.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

People assume that a Japanese (or Euro) sports car that competes with an American car should basically have the same performance and qualities, as they are competitors. In reality, Japanese and Euro brands CAN&#039;T compete with American sports cars because they are born from an entirely different legal world. Japs and Euros face stiff taxes on displacement and in some cases outright bans due to emissions bullshit. This means you either literally CAN&#039;T make a V8 car or if you do it has to be so expensive due to taxes/fees that it is a luxury car by default. Consider a Mustang GT which in Netherlands costs something like $80k... if you&#039;re going to spend $80k on a car most people would rather pay $100k and have a non-dogshit interior, whereas adding that additional $20k in price to an American mustang (going from $40k to $60k) is a much different proposition. However, the other thing people don&#039;t realize is that comparing 0-60 times and such as if faster always means better is the definition of bench racing.

People dislike this version of Celica in particular because it detracted so much from the previous Celicas it gained the name from. The previous Celicas were AWD or RWD platforms and have extensive motorsport heritage.<br><br>This modern iteration on the other hand, was an ode to early-2000&#039;s Fast Furious influence. They were more trying to gain the Honda Civic audience but failed to do so properly. When you modify this generation of Celica, you can have a decent peppy, track machine of sort. Many aftermarket parts available to tune it to your liking. But there were just so many better Japanese platforms out there and not to mention the European scene at the time as well as American machines of the early-2000&#039;s.

I have seen a diagram of a slightly different looking canister which shows that the small diameter vacuum hose controls a valve which allows vapor to be sucked through the larger hose out of the canister into the TB. I have also conversely read on a forum that the small hose is for idling, and the larger for open throttle, which makes no sense to me. If the first explanation is correct, i don&#039;t understand why, when you drive the car immediately after starting it (before the 02 sensors are heated up enough for the fuel system to be in closed loop control mode), the car drives perfectly fine, when by this explanation it should be getting extra fuel that is unaccounted for from the evap canister when vacuum opens that valve.
