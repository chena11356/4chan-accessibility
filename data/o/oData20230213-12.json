V8 Dodge Chargers and Lotus Esprits are definitely not tuners by any means however.<br>The Tokyo setting was also added as an afterthought in Remix and it itself was a rehash of the Tokyo map in MC2, though I found it rather disappointing that you don&#039;t even win any Japanese cars there outside of the Nissan concept car (and the Infiniti G35 technically, though it&#039;s in USDM form)<br>The customization is still top tier, however.

Look up ACTK-fr - I recommend them as the go-to for cars in general since they don&#039;t just collect and reupload them, but add LODs and fix some issues here and there, making them immediately better than what a lot of the original authors post since they can&#039;t bother to optimize their shit, specifically all the asshats that just try to sell their garbage on Patreon, not that there aren&#039;t good (free) car mods to be had on there and other similar sites. There are plenty of street cars and tracks on RaceDepartment, if you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for on either of those sites, look up Totsugeki - mostly Japanese cars and better presentation of what to expect. Assettoland would probably be the next place to check, though IMO it&#039;s kind of a disorganized clusterfuck after it got shutdown like three times for sharing payware cars. As for people on Patreon: Dan Bucsa, MacedoSTI, VR driving, Jerry Wei/\u4f2f\u745c \u9b4f, DanielDi, Just Kapi, etc. You can find a bunch of cars and shit searching on jewtube too. I&#039;d say don&#039;t bother with the Cut Up No Hesi servers unless you really want a specific car and have space, most of the cars in their packs are half-baked garbage, though their traffic pack I would say is the gold standard. Freeroam maps and driving with traffic? Search YouTube. There&#039;s a bunch now, though the best ones that I&#039;ve tried are LA Canyons, Pacific Coast Highway, Union Island, High Force, and Shutoko Revival Project. You&#039;ll have to get into discord servers to get download links to a lot of content too. Touge Union and Kami Trick have some nice content floating around. Currently 2REAL is the best traffic simulation but it&#039;s singleplayer only. If you want to do multiplayer with friends with AI traffic, look up Assetto Server.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support.

Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks.

Looking at pin chart looks like pins are in wrong spot on the obd receiver. Have to self diagnose. Father-in-law and I decide it might be the pump after verifying the fuses aren&#039;t broken.

Still nothing.<br><br>Today we decide to test the pump and I noticed something that my father-in-law is writing off. The pump only turns on, when we try to start the vehicle, and won&#039;t prime when we put the key in the on position.<br><br>At this point i think it&#039;s a wiring issue, he thinks it&#039;s an ECM issue.

I&#039;ve also seen an unbelievable amount of people showing up on zoom appearances while doing completely unrelated things like driving, shopping, or, recently, repairing a pool pump. Basically, show up in a suit and tie and, if it&#039;s on zoom, be in a clean room that says as best it can &quot;I am an upstanding citizen&quot;. Judges suck generally and will absolutely treat you differently based on that kind of thing.

Best technique I&#039;ve found when you&#039;re just accelerating normally and changing gears is do it exactly like a car. You slip the clutch just slightly when getting back on the throttle and letting the clutch lever out. In a car, you don&#039;t change gear, let clutch all the way out, then get back on throttle. You slip it a bit to make a smooth transition. When you&#039;re hammering down, you don&#039;t feel the harsh transition and you&#039;re shifting so fast anyway. Going to take some practice to get it down, just like everything else.

No license required if you&#039;re on private land or at an off road park. <br><br>2) If you really want to be riding in town, you can get an ebike. I&#039;ve ridden one that can get you up to 30mph just on throttle, and will pedal assist you to the point you can ride literally all day at that speed. Bonus is you can do hoon shit with them (hop curbs, jump down staircases, ride through parks, etc) and not catch any fines. Mopeds and surrons fit this category as well. <br><br>Chances are you&#039;re going to ignore those two great points I made and get a bike anyways. In that case definitely take the MSF, wear gear, and start with a low displacement bike for at least a year.

Watching crash compilations and normie riders in the real world has shown me that defensive riding can avoid most crashes. Crashes often involve:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Riding too fast for road conditions or visibility</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stunting or trying to show off</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Riding too fast for skill level</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Panicking and locking up, either just riding straight off the road or locking up the brakes and sliding out</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Clear dangerous scenario ahead, but rider either isn&#039;t paying attention or is too busy waving his arms around and yelling fucking cagers&quot; to actually take evasive action. This is a big one. For some reason all these riders would rather make a stand against a 2 ton steel box with just their flesh and bones just because they may have right of way. Obviously they&#039;re going to lose that fight and get hurt. While the rider may not be technically at fault, he got himself into an easily avoidable collision. Half the time they&#039;re wrong about having right of way anyway.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Riding in a way that puts them at greater risk of a traffic accident, such as not positioning himself for good visibility when approaching intersections, or even just going fast through intersections, or staying in blind spots of adjacent vehicles, or riding with a significant speed differential to traffic. While some of these are again not technically the rider&#039;s fault, they are his responsibility to avoid them because he&#039;s the one who&#039;s going to get hurt.</span><br><br>In short, consider your surroundings and view things from the perspective of other drivers. Never outride your line of sight or skill level. Nobody expects a bike to come flying over a hill or around a corner much faster than normal traffic, so they may be pulling out onto the road just as you appear.", "time": 1676129032, "resto": 26344372}, {"no": 26348674, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:24:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26348663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26348663</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;insectoid can&#039;t afford a car</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tries to convince actual humans to ride a bike as cope</span><br>many such cases", "filename": "1656701618371", "ext": ".png", "w": 1360, "h": 907, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676129042363551, "time": 1676129042, "md5": "6TkOhR31x7oacUyRfC3pLA==", "fsize": 2002846, "resto": 26344372}, {"no": 26348689, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26348674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26348674</a><br>i already have a car to drive, i just want a bike but im scared", "time": 1676129395, "resto": 26344372}, {"no": 26348707, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:35:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26348674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26348674</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying final destination turd world dual sport isn&#039;t amazing riding</span><br>git gud fag", "time": 1676129728, "resto": 26344372}, {"no": 26348744, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:51:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "op here, thanks guys, fuck it, ill just buy a dirtbike and ride it at my grandparents old place(they wont mind, theyre no longer in this world).

You might occasionally, and very rarely find the 305 (5.0 L) V8 which is just a de-borred 5.7, its the worst of both engines, massively less efficient for not that much power gain over the v6. <br><br>Now, 6.2 N/A and 6.5 Turbo diesels are very hit and miss. I won&#039;t get into them here since there&#039;s a lot to say about them either which way or another. <br><br>Now, if gas cost doesn&#039;t matter to you, a 454 (7.4L) V8 is very good. tons more power then the 5.7, and only a little less fuel economy. <br><br>from 88-95, you had the TBI injectors, and in 96, they introduced the VORTEC fuel system. Basically, torque figures stay roughly the same, but since the engine can breath better at higher RPMs, it makes almost twice the horsepower. <br><br>Personally, I prefer TBI since these aren&#039;t fast trucks and the extra HP doesn&#039;t actually make a difference. Vortec heads tend to blow up easier then TBI engines as well, and TBI is so basic simple to work on, i prefer the extra piece of mind the reliability give you. <br><br>Don&#039;t let any stupid boomer talk you into carb swaping them either. any carb is going to be less reliable then a TBI. you&#039;re going to make less power, get worse fuel economy, and you&#039;ve introduced more unreliable parts.

(KY3) - Motorcycle riders in Missouri may see some new law changes.
