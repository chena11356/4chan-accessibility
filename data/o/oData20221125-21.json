As for me, I think what often happens is that American car manufacturers always target everything aggressively to the moment, trying for everything to be as new-fangled and appealing to the sensibilities of the time as much as possible. This is why American cars tend to be so hit and miss aesthetically, and the Corvette is an excellent example of all of this.

I moved to eastern Europe a couple of years ago, and I bought one.<br><br>It is a beautiful car. I still admire mine when I walk up to it in a parking lot. I think that in the US, where most people have never seen one, you may get people thinking it&#039;s a Ferrari or some other very expensive car. To me, it feels like a very big car compared to the others I own, but, compared to American cars, it&#039;s not big. I think it would be very nice to drive on the more generously sized American roads. It&#039;s also an excellent cruiser that is very quiet at high speeds with great directional stability and suspension that soaks up bumps while still feeling planted. Mine has the 2.2L diesel (with a tune), and it just cruises quietly and effortlessly at 90 mph while having a good reserve of power for passing and still delivering high 30&#039;s mpg.<br><br>On the downside, the interior is pretty cramped. I&#039;m not a tall guy, but my seven year old daughter complains about leg room if she sits behind me. I swear a Ford Fiesta has more room inside. There isn&#039;t much interior storage (pockets, cubbies, etc.), and the cupholders are jokes, and if you want an armrest (rare and relatively expensive part but also chinzy and cheap feeling) you lose the cupholders and make the interior feel more cramped. The power seats can&#039;t be adjusted by adult sized hands when the doors are closed. Also, while the chassis is great for long distance cruising, it is definitely not sporty. If there&#039;s a word that is the opposite of &quot;tossable&quot;, that would be a good description.<br><br>I haven&#039;t mentioned maintenance. In the US, you&#039;ll be on your own.
