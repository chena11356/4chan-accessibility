From \u201cproblematic\u201d cartoons, to \u201ccontroversial\u201d messaging in movies, and even questionable public education practices, we can\u2019t seem to get away from it. That\u2019s especially true about cars. There\u2019s an awful lot of stereotyping going on about just who you are as a person based on the vehicle you drive. And if you drive an electric car, chances are you lean left, believe that status-quo \u201cgreen\u201d advocacy like EVs will somehow deter climate change, and probably have no idea that WEF founder Klaus Schwab is a suspected Leninist. This stereotype is somehow not the case if you drive a Hummer EV, because it\u2019s heavy or something.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As it turns out, however, the government of Wyoming appears sick and tired of the whole thing.

That\u2019s a lot mining. That\u2019s a lot of tearing the earth open as a means of saving it. And it begs to question what EV advocates are willing to support once mining companies start ripping apart Idaho for cobalt.</span>", "filename": "mctwyevban", "ext": ".png", "w": 556, "h": 739, "tn_w": 188, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674416454663848, "time": 1674416454, "md5": "xrNe5P4XsPD3AVmpAAB/0g==", "fsize": 527064, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-ongoing-culture-war-has-weaponized-even-our", "replies": 128, "images": 10, "unique_ips": 30}, {"no": 26285205, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wyoming, which holds 3 electoral votes to California\u2019s 55, appears to be signaling to the anti-EV crowd that it would perhaps like more electoral votes.

The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass.

Catch is that i live in quebec where we put a lot of salt on our roads and this car has rust. It needs a new crossmember, theres a good amount of surface rust at the base of the steering column under the dash, the undercarriage is in expected shape but not too bad. Theres also a couple spots of rust on panel edges but minor. Do you guys think it would be a good idea to take out the savings i have set aside for a car and buy it? I understand id have to put in a good grand or two but im willing to if the rust can be dealt with. I dont mind putting money into it but i dont want a money pit, i can always keep looking.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!
