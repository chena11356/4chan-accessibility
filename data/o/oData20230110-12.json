The team that year aimed for overall victory and as such acquired a car that could bring them that. That said car was the 2002 GT500 spec Honda NSX. The mid-engine car was already a proven victor in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship thanks to the three wins earned by Nakajima Racing, and one each by Mugen and Dome in the 2002 season.<br><br>The #3 Honda NSX was entered under the Sport Auto banner and was driven by Armin Hahne, Robert Lechner, Markus Oestreich, and Robin Liddell. A few changes were done to the car to accommodate Nurburgring and the length of the race. One of those changes was the V6 engine being down tuned from the JGTC regulated 500hp to 420hp for reliability. Other changes include endurance lights and Michelin tires of which the car never ran on in the JGTC. The NSX weigh a minimum of 1200kg as par the rules of A6, the class the Honda competed in at Nurburgring.<br><br>The #3 Sport Auto NSX had a small amount of kilometres under its belt before contesting the 24 Hours of Nurburgring. Lack of testing however didn&#039;t stop the German squad from placing inside the top 15 in qualifying, showing the potential of a JGTC car in uncharted territory. The NSX successfully started the race keeping up with the cars ahead of it which included DTM derived machinery from Audi and Opel. The car however experienced technical problems early in the race and completed 38 laps/7 hours before retiring. https://youtu.be/LRKIAK5Yw3w", "filename": "1280px-Honda_NSX-R_(24h_N\u00fcrburgring)",

The CVT computer or computer systems as a whole are known to refuse to transmit power purely to prevent a high load from being transferred through the CVT.

The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800\u2013900 kilometres (500\u2013560 mi) per day. &quot;Amateurs&quot; typically struggle with the event. The rough terrain and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.<br><br>The Dakar rally features a much greater variety of vehicles than traditional rally&#039;s, including bikes, quads, and trucks. Dominant manufacturers within the Dakar Rally are KTM for bikes, Yamaha for quads and Kamaz in trucks. Out of the big three Kamaz are most notable as they have won using the largest variety of vehicles instead of sticking with a select few models. In 2006 a tracked vehicle category was proposed and rejected due to the necessary volume of sub-divisions to ensure fair competition. In 2018 an EV category was proposed, this to was rejected as &quot;there currently exists no electric vehicle capable of crossing the most remote stages of the Dakar unsupported and it would place an unnecessary risk on support crews to enable them to do so&quot;, despite annual reviews and counter-claims this continues to be the case.

and EVs currently.<br>Full size body-on-frame SUVs with traditional longitudinal drivetrain have a purpose. Towing or plowing with a short wheelbase. Same with mid-size SUVs with the traditional longitudinal drivetrain for rough terrain and light towing. I am not a fan of rollover prone designs. Death traps are to be scrapped.<br>SUVs like the Escape, Equinox, MDX, Murano and Tucson are glorified AWD versions of FWD car drivetrains. Crossovers are soullessly designed. Many crossovers are garbage piles with plenty of failures and terrible to work on. Unibody full size SUVs share similar failures and repair difficulty. EVs require a reliance on Chinese lithium and chips, so they are not good for humanity. I am looking forward to golf cart level technology that can allow for easy diagnosis and repair. I don&#039;t want to be at the mercy of a touch screen going out and glitching or communist spyware. I&#039;ve heard one too many stories of vehicles locking then catching on fire.

By then, your oil, while cooler than coolant, will be warm enough to be to its correct viscosity (110F is what the local V8 tuner told me was the minimum &quot;send it&quot; temp for oil, which occurs basically right when my car hits the minimum &quot;normal&quot; coolant temp). Too much idling will clog everything up, and naturally slamming the throttle and revving out will blow your engine if you do it enough on a cold engine, esp. a performance engine.

the south so rust isnt a problem. id like to daily drive a 60s car but the fuel consumption, age and lack of parts is a problem. soviet cars, especially ladas dont have that issue since everythings on
