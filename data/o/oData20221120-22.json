I never thought R32 was designed for racing from scratch because Skyline name (and the platform, as I assumed) was used for the usual boring street cars, and even the GTR range had four-door sedans. So I thought it was something like BMW M range with the same worth, but an unusual following among some specific groups of people. I also had some suspicions that R34 was heavily shilled in vidya, but I stopped playing those roughly after NFS HP2, and never got on that &quot;underground street racing&quot; hype train (and never watched any FnF franchise btw).", "time": 1668948258, "resto": 26086277}, {"no": 26094543, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)07:48:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Correction: fuck off, not fuck you, but the unwillingness to answer the question raises more questions.", "time": 1668948486, "resto": 26086277}], "last_modified": 1668948486}, {"no": 26094454, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)06:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You WILL drive the electric crossover and you WILL like it", "filename": "fiesta", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1007, "h": 848, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 210, "tim": 1668944814056946, "time": 1668944814, "md5": "b8wDWsTTIsuP9Pkv4S+qoA==", "fsize": 91581, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-will-drive-the-electric-crossover-and-you", "replies": 8, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 26094482, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)07:03:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26094470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26094470</a><br>Yes in Europe many people still drive cars despite all their propaganda, so they&#039;re just forcing them away now.
