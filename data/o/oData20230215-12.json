I spend 50 minutes per day driving and have free parking at home and at work. My colleagues who use transit spend 120+ minutes per day commuting. They are losing ~6 hours per week of their life to take transit. They spend $200/month on their transit passes and my insurance is $120/month. Add gas and maintenance and I&#039;m only spending about an extra $50/week more than they do, and I have the convenience of owning a car, which I can use for road trips and errands. <br><br>So I spend $50 per week to save myself ~6 hours per week. I make $40/hr, so that&#039;s a really good deal for me. And if you&#039;re going to argue that transit is better than driving because you can read or whatever and you can&#039;t do that while driving, then I would tell you that you&#039;re a poser whos never used transit. When you ride transit in rush hour it&#039;s not comfortable and you can&#039;t realistically read or enjoy the experience. The only thing you can do is listen to a podcast or audiobook or something else auditory, which, guess what, you can also do in a car. <br><br>The only time when transit matches or beats a car for commuting is when you live right downtown in the center of a big, dense urban core.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support. I&#039;ll repeat, this isn&#039;t a hit piece on them or any other vendor specifically, but you&#039;ll know what to watch out for when you see it enough times.<br><br>Again, I think keeping them is beneficial (unless for reasons including but not limited to the aforementioned for removal).

Again, I&#039;m completely on board with you. If enough people point out that there&#039;s an issue with someone or if there&#039;s evidence of foul play then we&#039;ll take care of it because we don&#039;t want people throwing away their money because we didn&#039;t clean up the site. Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers.

Being surrounded by trees while climbing to the top of a narrow, twisty mountain road, to then be greeted by a scenic outlook over the 1/3rd of the island is a vastly superior choice. I&#039;ve been driving for 12 years and have never crashed or been ticketed. The only thing I&#039;ve paid for has been gas and parts. Also, the nearest track is over 2k miles from me (I live on an island,) and it would cost a minimum of $4k just to ship my shitbox round trip before even considering travel expenses. I have no interest in wasting hours in a day researching the best prices for hotels, tickets, and shipping costs, and then needing to wait for it to get between destinations, and then take days off just to go driving to drive during their operational hours on whatever days they allow, when I can just immediately go out for a drive whenever I feel like it for free and also come back to the comfort of my own home at any time. As I said, it&#039;s possible to speed responsibly. I don&#039;t care if that makes your butt hurt. Yeah, there are a lot of shitty drivers on the road, but drunk drivers are significantly more hazardous than some people going for some spirited driving in the mountains or dragging on a lone straight.

In my province of British Columbia they implemented this over 10 years ago. While it was mainly chinks in their high powered exotic cars racing around Vancouver that led to civil forfeiture being a thing, here&#039;s the problem with that: Around the same time they also implemented short to longer term impounds of vehicles for street racing. So you&#039;ll lose your ride for at least 7 days, pay a hefty fine plus towing/storage costs, and possibly lose your license if you have prior history of racing/stunting. I believe this to be more than enough to handle anyone that&#039;s a problem. Now, while I have no problems with rich Hongers getting fucked here, police are given a wide margin of discretion on when to simply impound, or seize for civil forfeiture. Stunting/street racing here encompasses a variety of things... Simply burning rubber could technically get your shit seized for forfeiture, although I&#039;m not aware of this happening. Simply spinning your tires on a slick wet street could get your shit impounded, whether you meant to or not. The law here is very vague, in what you can do and can&#039;t do, and what repercussions you may face. Of course we all have our chance in court here to &#039;tell it to the judge&#039;, but never before has civil forfeiture been a thing here for vehicles unless they were proven to be bought by proceeds of crime (drug dealers), or utilized in a serious crime (robbing a bank). The threshold for forfeiture has dropped too low now, where spinning tires in the wet could be considered stunting, which is now considered stunting, now considered a serious crime, leading to possible seizure.", "time": 1676457728, "resto": 26357406}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26344350, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)20:46:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How do you prevent this", "filename": "1675568749288588", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1365, "h": 538, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 98, "tim": 1675993614243905, "time": 1675993614, "md5": "toO0LtNQCK6fSH66Rpyywg==", "fsize": 44038, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-you-prevent-this", "replies": 85, "images": 18, "unique_ips": 51}, {"no": 26344357, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)20:49:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>Learn about braking, it&#039;s always the skill slow normies completely lack which makes the biggest difference to their speed.", "time": 1675993753, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345003, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:22:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344357</a><br>shut up next you&#039;re going to say line locks are useful in a drag race<br><br>EVERYBODY KNOWS A CAR HAS ONLY ONE IMPORTANT CONTROL AND THAT&#039;S A CAR MAGAZINE", "time": 1676010149, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345007, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:24:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>Know the difference between a GT car and a sports car.", "time": 1676010271, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345017, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:31:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "N\u00fcrburgring is 200% skill.", "time": 1676010669, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345096, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>Shows the power of tires and knowing when and how to absolutely send it", "time": 1676013823, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345142, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:54:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>now i want to see a dhl van race a twingo", "filename": "dhlburger", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 420, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1676015655058648, "time": 1676015655, "md5": "sU8oyfwX4ITQtBsF+3ovtw==", "fsize": 102457, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26345150, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://youtu.be/A28zps9Q-gE<br>very nice", "time": 1676015797, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346712, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:12:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>you dont", "filename": "IMG_20200128_085609_739", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2080, "h": 1560, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676063535682006, "time": 1676063535, "md5": "0rzlsLbRcpX2QAdzisWyaA==", "fsize": 315841, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346730, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:23:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>How embarrassing.", "time": 1676064218, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346731, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26345142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26345142</a><br>Why are people taking delivery vans and muranos around the nerd burger ring?", "time": 1676064224, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346749, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:29:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26346731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26346731</a><br>why not?", "time": 1676064564, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346754, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:33:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>driver skill is the most important thing", "filename": "nasa_specmiata", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676064824082549, "time": 1676064824, "md5": "LQch38unBhOuA7rm1Z1mxw==", "fsize": 213611, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346755, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:36:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26344350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26344350</a><br>Make sure you&#039;re the one driving the Twingo and not the 350z", "time": 1676064985, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346779, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:52:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26346731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26346731</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not tracking vehicles not designed to be tracked</span><br>ngmi", "time": 1676065978, "resto": 26344350}, {"no": 26346802, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)17:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26346731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26346731</a><br>because its the ultimate flex against fags with &quot;&quot;&quot;fast&quot;&quot;&quot;

It depends on your interest rate, your tolerance of risk/loss, and your time horizon. Over a long enough time horizon, the stock market will beat everything else. In a shorter window of time, however, the stock market is volatile and you&#039;re at risk of losing money. <br><br>The long term average return of stocks is about 9-10% but that will likely drop a bit in the near future as economic growth slows, so perhaps think of it as more like 8%. Bonds have been forgotten thanks to decades of low interest rates. The problem with bonds is that the safe ones, like government bonds, pay very little. GIC&#039;s are guaranteed but they only pay a low yield. I don&#039;t even know what they&#039;re paying these days because I forgot they existed since we had 20 years of near zero interest rates. They were paying ~2-3% for a while. Perhaps they&#039;re up around 4% now or might be soon. <br><br>Even if interest rates go up, I still doubt that any &quot;safe&quot; investment would beat your interest payments on your car. Pretty much the only way to beat it is if you have excellent credit and get a low rate, and then invest your money in stocks. Of course, invest it in a non-retarded way, like in a REIT or index fund or ETF. <br><br>But if I&#039;m being honest with you, you don&#039;t sound like someone who&#039;s very familiar with all of this and given that you&#039;d probably be better off just buying the car outright.

Most people absolutely suck ass at investing in the stock market because they don&#039;t know how it works and they panic and sell when their position is down, which is the exact opposite of what you should do.

The biggest problem is always wheel slip and selective brake application does fine in most cases in controlling that. It offers a level of control that isn&#039;t possible with a driver.<br><br>With the right control algorithms, it&#039;ll likely replace 4WD in consumer applications, relegating full time 4WD/AWD and lockers to hobbyist/specialty applications. Now that cars don&#039;t have to navigate terrain blind with wheel speed, yaw, pitch rate sensors, they&#039;ll probably integrate their radar and camera systems to scan its surroundings. I can&#039;t imagine how nightmarishly complex a system like this would have to be, but the compute capacity for industrial computation is there. I would wager that CAN-FD standard does not have enough data throughput to support that right now, and a new ISO standard will have to be implemented for the high data throughputs that are necessitated for even basic things like a truly intelligent, terrain-aware 4WD/AWD system, let alone fully autonomous driving.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

For example the P2 Volvo S80 T6 uses the GM 4T65-E, and many FWD GM products do as well. The V6s in said GM products also happen to be identical to their RWD counterparts. My line of thinking is that if the Volvo 4T65-E is identical to a GM unit (bell housing and starter location), it would be possible to bolt up a Volvo B629T4 into a GM F-body.

If that one isn&#039;t low enough for you just shake his hand, thank him for his time, remind them that they have your phone # and to call you if they can match your offer, then just leave.

My first racing vehicle was a 200cc briggs &amp; stratton powered single gear go kart. I towed that sucker behind a miata on the cheapest trailer from Lowes with every tool I owned stuffed in the trunk and under the roll bar. Took it to the kart track every other weekend, and took it to the big tracks too. My glorified lawn mower turned lap times as good as a spec miata or spec racer ford. Really cheap to run, tires last multiple weekends and it runs on clear gas from regular gas stations. After that I raced stock honda cr125 shifter karts which cost more to run but can annihilate an exotic street car on a race track. While I raced I slowly collected more tools, better tow vehicle, bigger trailer, etc. Rented rides in a few different types of cars. Now I drive a formula continental but the only startup cost was the car itself. It&#039;s an extremely good value class in terms of speed per dollar spent and there are decent sized fields to race in, albeit nothing compared SM or SRF. You get to have a modern spaceframe racecar with pushrod suspension and downforce but costs are kept pretty minimal as no carbon fiber is allowed to touch air so the wings are aluminum and diffuser fiberglass which forces the designs to be simpler. I highly recommend it. But for the truly lowest budget racer? Go karts all the way.

Look up ACTK-fr - I recommend them as the go-to for cars in general since they don&#039;t just collect and reupload them, but add LODs and fix some issues here and there, making them immediately better than what a lot of the original authors post since they can&#039;t bother to optimize their shit, specifically all the asshats that just try to sell their garbage on Patreon, not that there aren&#039;t good (free) car mods to be had on there and other similar sites. There are plenty of street cars and tracks on RaceDepartment, if you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for on either of those sites, look up Totsugeki - mostly Japanese cars and better presentation of what to expect. Assettoland would probably be the next place to check, though IMO it&#039;s kind of a disorganized clusterfuck after it got shutdown like three times for sharing payware cars. As for people on Patreon: Dan Bucsa, MacedoSTI, VR driving, Jerry Wei/\u4f2f\u745c \u9b4f, DanielDi, Just Kapi, etc. You can find a bunch of cars and shit searching on jewtube too. I&#039;d say don&#039;t bother with the Cut Up No Hesi servers unless you really want a specific car and have space, most of the cars in their packs are half-baked garbage, though their traffic pack I would say is the gold standard. Freeroam maps and driving with traffic? Search YouTube. There&#039;s a bunch now, though the best ones that I&#039;ve tried are LA Canyons, Pacific Coast Highway, Union Island, High Force, and Shutoko Revival Project. You&#039;ll have to get into discord servers to get download links to a lot of content too. Touge Union and Kami Trick have some nice content floating around. Currently 2REAL is the best traffic simulation but it&#039;s singleplayer only. If you want to do multiplayer with friends with AI traffic, look up Assetto Server.
