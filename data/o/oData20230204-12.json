People dislike this version of Celica in particular because it detracted so much from the previous Celicas it gained the name from. The previous Celicas were AWD or RWD platforms and have extensive motorsport heritage.<br><br>This modern iteration on the other hand, was an ode to early-2000&#039;s Fast Furious influence. They were more trying to gain the Honda Civic audience but failed to do so properly. When you modify this generation of Celica, you can have a decent peppy, track machine of sort. Many aftermarket parts available to tune it to your liking. But there were just so many better Japanese platforms out there and not to mention the European scene at the time as well as American machines of the early-2000&#039;s.

These are mass-produced shitboxes from 40 years ago. All the richfags have their mint untouched stock versions already so if you get your hands on one of these meme cars why shouldnt you treat it like the meme it is. Making your car look more like an anime or video game car isn&#039;t any different than those fags on /k/ who buy meme wraps for their rifle, or anything else. Most 80s cars were nothing better than an appliance and a lot of these meme shitboxes are built like the cheapest toaster you can find on Amazon.

I have seen a diagram of a slightly different looking canister which shows that the small diameter vacuum hose controls a valve which allows vapor to be sucked through the larger hose out of the canister into the TB. I have also conversely read on a forum that the small hose is for idling, and the larger for open throttle, which makes no sense to me. If the first explanation is correct, i don&#039;t understand why, when you drive the car immediately after starting it (before the 02 sensors are heated up enough for the fuel system to be in closed loop control mode), the car drives perfectly fine, when by this explanation it should be getting extra fuel that is unaccounted for from the evap canister when vacuum opens that valve.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

People assume that a Japanese (or Euro) sports car that competes with an American car should basically have the same performance and qualities, as they are competitors. In reality, Japanese and Euro brands CAN&#039;T compete with American sports cars because they are born from an entirely different legal world. Japs and Euros face stiff taxes on displacement and in some cases outright bans due to emissions bullshit. This means you either literally CAN&#039;T make a V8 car or if you do it has to be so expensive due to taxes/fees that it is a luxury car by default. Consider a Mustang GT which in Netherlands costs something like $80k... if you&#039;re going to spend $80k on a car most people would rather pay $100k and have a non-dogshit interior, whereas adding that additional $20k in price to an American mustang (going from $40k to $60k) is a much different proposition. However, the other thing people don&#039;t realize is that comparing 0-60 times and such as if faster always means better is the definition of bench racing.

Even then its not going to be amazing until you spend a bit more. 3d scanners that are 1k and below dont work as well with flat pieces even if youre using markers. they are better with natural shapes like a bust of a person. This is why most 3d scanners will include a bust to showcase the product since it performs reasonably well. Also some scanners will not get measurements correct and youll end up with a part with bad dimensions. Either way 3d scanners will require you to know how to 3d model and youll have to clean them up in post. sometimes its easier to just use calipers and design the piece from scratch.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3d printing</span><br>with 3d printing theres also a lot that goes into it. you can use a budget printer from around 250 bucks but youll have to spend a lot on upgrades and accessories. realistically youre going to want to spend around 700 minimum on a quality printer, then all the upgrades and accessories like an enclosure and hot ends to deal with the type of material you print. You should be printing in ASA or ABS which most cheap printers cannot print well. resin printers have some good stuff but in my opinion you can stick to fdm printers since you get larger build areas and youll be printing in abs anyways instead of abs-like resins. so youre looking at at least 2k for the base setups, then you have to spend time learning how to scan, model, and print. this will take a lot of time and energy. you will have to do many many trials on each step. Ive been doing it for my car and its a bitch. also anything less than abs will just melt/deform in the car.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related oem in black and 3d model in orange</span>", "filename": "A8E80E3A-9348-4E01-A2F2-EBBCFF1CA99E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 2268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675471686465197, "time": 1675471686, "md5": "j+BI52b8zJPWaqedpFpbww==", "fsize": 2014337, "resto": 26324717}, {"no": 26325509, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:03:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325106</a><br><a href=\"#p26325276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325276</a><br><a href=\"#p26325455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325455</a><br>My brother turned a Xbox connect box into a 3d scanner for like $100.<br><br><a href=\"#p26324717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26324717</a><br>Yes it is.<br>I sell 3d printed and other metal parts for Camaros.<br>It&#039;s not a cash cow, but around $200 a month in sales.", "time": 1675472583, "resto": 26324717}, {"no": 26325578, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:39:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26324717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26324717</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sticky switches</span><br>just a paint issue, ultrasonic bath + ISO + paint + re laser etching the graphic.

They required regular fluid changes, usually only lasted 100k before needing a rebuild, and got worse MPG than a manual. <br><br>On the other hand, manuals were 5 or 6 speed with close ratios and a fuel economy gear at the top so they&#039;d get great highway MPG, could be launched at higher RPM (without drag modifications and the shitty drivability that comes with them), and stayed in the powerband better. As long as you could manage the clutch and shifter, the car was all around better. My first car was a 6 speed manual and I could dust cars well above my price bracket with automatics all day long.<br><br>Nowadays, the autos are faster at the drag strip and track while getting better MPG and sometimes even lasting longer between services/replacements (lifetime fill transmissions going 300k+ vs. a manual that will usually need a clutch by 100-150k).

Showers is another big one.

Even if you have a regular source of water, you can only have so much on hand before that is all you are storing. We had to experiment as we went to figure out what was a good amount of water to have on hand without having to carry a hundred gallons around all the time.<br>There isn&#039;t enough room to have the best of everything you need, or even good versions of everything you need. You&#039;re going to have to cut corners and use tools outside of their intended purpose and seldom used/non-critical tools will often be cheap, light, and easy to stow away somewhere. You work out the things that matter and you may end up spending space and weight on those trivialities - your chair, a cot, etc. <br>Hobbies that allow you to spend significant amounts of time without further resource investment and with a small footprint are almost required to not go crazy or spend all day on your phone. BB guns, darts, whittling, yo-yos - there are a ton of little considered hobbies that induce zen-like states that will help you keep your mind clear and keep boredom at bay.<br>I did it all NOT being broke and it was frequently uncomfortable.

IMO the A4/S4 is better than the S3/A3. The Quattro system in the A4 (ultra) and the S4 (crown/torsen) is worth paying for. <br><br>Quattro ultra has the detached rear axle when you don\u2019t need awd. Audi noticed it\u2019s A4/Q5 customers were thinking in terms of \u2018gee AWD uses more gas so maybe I\u2019ll get FWD and stay home if it snows\u2019 instead of thinking about sporty ness. Since torsen uses .6L of fuel extra per 60km Quattro ultra uses .2L and so it offers the best of both worlds for customers that were torn on Quattro. It\u2019s also exoerimxe better than torsen in the snow/ice as ids faster to get torque where it needs to go. <br>Haldex sucks bad. The engine is all forward of the front axle. It barely sends power rear except in extreme situations and the worst part is it breaks in as little as 10k miles. The A4 ultra is fwd biased like Haldex but the weight is minimal, the engine is mroe rear, the system is much more siphsitaced in terms of engaging the clutch and it\u2019s much more robust and has no issues with reliability. <br><br>The nice thing about the A4 is the current 4 cylinder is very reliable and the water pump meme is covered by a recall. I doubt you have warranty issues to worry about. Since Audi puts engines on the front axle a 4 cylinder is ideal because it\u2019s compact and weighs little so the A4 has a good argument for handling the best. <br>Order an 034 Motorsport rear sway bar and you\u201dll have a very neutral handling car with great awd and a DCT.", "time": 1675352920, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320963, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:54:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320947</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a tuned S6 running bunkers numbers and fully modified suspension and my dealer loves the car and always run my warranty</span><br>just to clarify, you have an S6 that you&#039;ve tuned extensively, broke something in your drivetrain, and they warrantied those repairs? what kind of powertrain repairs did they perform under warranty with your tune?", "time": 1675353258, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320970, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320813</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no r8 for me then</span><br><br>imagine my reaction when i found out the hard way", "filename": "dont", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 231, "h": 218, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1675353346580871, "time": 1675353346, "md5": "7ymVmCpXCYP2C1Vm5r2zNg==", "fsize": 5681, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320973, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320963</a><br>The S3 they replaced the Haldex and rear bumper.

From the first chart it appears that the rate of charge can be greater than the rate of discharge. The only instance that I can see is that the BMS self regulates the incoming or outgoing voltage in order to evenly distribute charge safely across all the cells to avoid an imbalanced charge distribution.<br>At the same time the second figure describes where batteries can safely charge and discharge but the BMS ultimately sets the rate. It doesn&#039;t talk specifically about the given rate but it definitely doesn&#039;t entirely inhibit discharging at the expense of charging. It just suggests the BMS limits the rate, but to what degree it doesn&#039;t say. Even then the BMS is just there for protecting and capacity management. That chemical reaction I talked about is still rate limited almost entirely by temperature.
