Vehicles given here aren&#039;t great so this is definitely one of the last areas to do in the entire DLC lineup when you&#039;re better equipped.<br>2: Vehicles are a gimmick used only largely on this map, but the difficulty is interesting at least with mud/snow mix. I like the verticality of this one.<br>3: One of the better areas for starters because the oversized trailers can actually be used rather well here. Hope you like mud, but probably next to Alaska in ease. Vehicles here are kind of nice.<br>4: It&#039;s Season 1 but with even more dickheaded design. You do get the best superheavy truck on this level to compensate. Just like 1, I wouldn&#039;t come here until you have better equipment.<br>Year 2:<br>5: Distilled bullshit starting off. Not as bad once you get the tempo down and get out some decent ground clearance trucks. Trucks unlocked here are okay but nothing to note since you probably have a decent lineup by now.<br>6: Gimmick is a Hardcore-Lite mode until you progress far enough, in which is just becomes like 2 but easier. Trucks you get here are good but unlock way too damn late.<br>7: Easily and without a doubt the single worst DLC of the game. Not really tough but extremely lacking content and feels like recycled assets from the Dakar game they (then) recently released. Vehicles really only work on this level and nowhere else in the game, and the whole level is so short with content you could 100% it in a session or two.<br>8: Tries to redeem the failure of 7 by adding four massive areas to drive around in.

This was the preorder DLC which dominates Michigan/early game, but very quickly falls off later.<br>Brigadier: This is just a slightly fancier version of the GMC truck you get from Michigan. It&#039;s an okay performing truck but I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s mandatory or good except if you want to be a completionist.<br>Chevy Apache: Similar to the Navistar in that it&#039;s like a truck you will get later on (YAR in vanilla) unlocked earlier to dominate early game.<br>CAT CT681/International HX 520: Arguably the best premiums because of being free, they make excellent support trucks. The CAT 681 when upgraded with a good engine and highrange is one of the best trucks in the game for moving quick.<br>Western Star 49X: A big fat heavy truck that is only really good for pulling large trailers. Will fuck you if you play Hard mode due to the extra maintenance costs.<br>Tatra 813/805: You&#039;ll get this one automatically on buying the Year 1 pass. 805 makes for a very good heavy offroad truck until you get a larger toolset to use.

If it was still early on you could argue the Navistar is an unbalanced preorder truck but it too has problems like no diff lock and chugs fuel like a motherfucker. Play it similar to the CAT by slamming it in high on highrange and letting it boulder through terrain rather than sink in. Even with just the Year 1 pass the game dumps the Bandit on you and the 805, which is more than enough to get the Zikz.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lake Kovd</span><br>It is a tough area, but it really is a very pretty area and the borealis at night also helps.

Place the boards in their fully deployed position. In most cases, it may be easier to remove the motors from the motor linkages to allow the steps to fully deploy, and proceed with the rest of the process.<br>2. Verify that the pinch weld holes are lining up with the holes for the linkages. You may need to enlarge the holes in the pinch weld if they do not line up or are catching the bolt threads as you install the steps.<br>3. Verify that the rear of the running board is flush with the rear linkage. If it is not, adjust the running board forward so that the end cap is flush with the linkage.<br>4. Make sure that ALL HARDWARE IS TIGHTENED PROPERLY.<br>5. Have someone walk the length of the board, taking bouncing steps or shifting their weight up and down as they walk. DO NOT JUMP on the running boards. Only shift your weight up and down while moving the entire length of the running board, like you are performing a suspension check.<br>6. With the boards still in the down position, loosen the button head Torx head bolts that go through the pinch weld. DO NOT loosen the hex head bolts on the back of the rocker panel. Then, either have someone sit on the center of the board or put some weight on the center of the board. While there is weight on the board, retighten the button head bolts going through the pinch weld.<br>7. Remove the weight from the board, and try moving the board up to the completely stowed position. Check to see if the board clears the pinch weld. If it clears, reinstall the motors and complete the installation. In some cases where the pinch weld is more uneven, you may need to do this complete procedure a second or third time. If the step still does not clear the pinch weld after several seating attempts, please continue on to Step 8.", "time": 1673734812, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260031, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:49:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259965</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DO NOT JUMP</span><br>Meth is one hell of a drug.", "time": 1673736572, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260062, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26259743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26259743</a><br>It was but needed a head gasket", "time": 1673737293, "resto": 26257800}, {"no": 26260080, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:07:03", "name": "BigC", "com": "<a href=\"#p26260031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26260031</a><br>I never jumped, read my posts again or learn to read, my post said bounce <br>The other dude who was the boss jumped, he did hundreds more than I ever did so I don&#039;t question him <br>Ball joint and regear time", "filename": "IMG_20230114_150616_108", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673737623692758, "time": 1673737623, "md5": "JMU2klRDNwkQn+PmNqMecg==", "fsize": 259713, "resto": 26257800, "trip": "!PAWS/PFILI"}, {"no": 26260204, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I refuse to drive my rust free LR3 in the salt, but it did pretty good last blizzard just fucking around.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

Typically, the insulation on wires can only handle 20 amps continuous if the wire is at least 12ga. But other higher temp insulation exists that allow 20 amps with only 14ga wire. So the special 14ga wire is protected by the 20 amp fuse because it has a special coating, but your wire will probably have a different coating and need to be 12ga to stay a safe temperature for the wire insulation.<br>As the first reply said, stick to the same size fuse. It protects the weakest link in the system. You still need to protect the insulation on the 14ga even if you splice in some 8ga wire. Higher can allow the weakest link to become dangerously hot. If you go lower, you don&#039;t get additional protection but you get to replace the fuse more often.", "time": 1673814089, "resto": 26260540}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26253441, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "2024 GTR", "com": "It&#039;s so fucking ugly", "filename": "Screenshot from 2023-01-13 12-04-38", "ext": ".png", "w": 931, "h": 420, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1673571934709607, "time": 1673571934, "md5": "aqSN2pQ/gidafcnHzLKdbg==", "fsize": 341367, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "2024-gtr", "replies": 72, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 60}, {"no": 26253461, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:08:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Looks fat", "filename": "Screenshot from 2023-01-13 12-08-40", "ext": ".png", "w": 938, "h": 457, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1673572133766727, "time": 1673572133, "md5": "iB3ClxPsg3CEoVyiDupTQA==", "fsize": 467682, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253498, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "supra got a manual. will the GTR get a manual now?", "time": 1673572726, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253499, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:18:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Did they finally figure out a way to make it faster than the Corvette?", "time": 1673572729, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253501, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:18:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br>Nismo looks fine since its got those square side grills which complements the boxier look they&#039;re going for", "filename": "MY24-Nissan-GT-R-5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673572733531093, "time": 1673572733, "md5": "xkfraeomOKYZRbo7Da4Aeg==", "fsize": 108522, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253504, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:19:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br>looks exactly the same, just a little more rounded edges, meh.", "time": 1673572797, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253514, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"/o/thread/26252104#p26252104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26252104</a></span>", "time": 1673572936, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26253519, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:23:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253461</a><br>zoomer", "time": 1673572987, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254005, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:19:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br>It looks EXACTLY the same except with a slightly better front bumper.<br><br>Nothing has changed since 2009.", "time": 1673583565, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254037, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:39:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26254005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26254005</a><br>And that&#039;s a good thing", "time": 1673584740, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254295, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:32:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who gives a fuck<br>This hunk of shit is finally going out of production", "time": 1673591539, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254579, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)04:13:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it an EV?", "time": 1673601221, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254659, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:16:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br>So what, we arent making new chassis anymore nissan?", "time": 1673604984, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254712, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:54:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26254005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26254005</a><br>Actually the car has changed every single year it&#039;s been in production", "time": 1673607251, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254770, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:25:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253441</a><br><a href=\"#p26253461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253461</a><br>christ almighty this roof is so damn ugly", "time": 1673609111, "resto": 26253441}, {"no": 26254789, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:36:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is there 12 feet between the ground and window?
