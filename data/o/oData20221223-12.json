Take care of the car, and it will take care of you. Most common issues I&#039;ve seen are crankcase vent failure and the upper electronic module failing. A failed crankcase vent will cause excessive oil consumption and if ignored for long enough will cause the cam seals to rupture and leak oil onto the timing belt. If you don&#039;t want to bend all 20 of your valves, replace your crankcase vent as soon as you know it has failed. Common signs of failure are bad oil consumption (check your dipstick regularly between oil changes), oil cap and dipstick are hard to remove during engine idle at operating temperature, or if the rubber hose connected to the charge pipe is covered in oil. The plastic pipe over the valve cover, and the hose connects at the bottom by the radiator fan. I typically only see upper electronic module (UEM) failure on old pieces of shit that come in with SRS lights. Worn shocks and leaking CV axle boots are common too, but that&#039;s because the cars are just old.<br><br>There&#039;s currently a recall out for the steering wheel airbag because it doesn&#039;t deploy exactly how Volvo wants it to. If the airbag is dark grey and the plastic cover feels fairly new, safe to say the recall has been performed.<br><br>If you&#039;re a DIYer, be aware that parts aren&#039;t exactly cheap, and if they are they most likely suck. Stick to OEM, or if you&#039;re looking for aftermarket upgrades IPD is the way to go. If you take your car to shops, find a Volvo specialist or just take your car to a Volvo dealer. It will be more expensive obviously, but most mechanics are scared to work on Volvos for some reason. Take your car somewhere that&#039;s familiar with Volvos and you&#039;ll most likely recieve very reliable work<br><br>t.

Tons of gauges with chrome rings around them, for owner-ops and companies that want to have lots of chrome on the road.<br><br>Western Star is a more rare one, all custom built trucks, like Peterbilt but more exclusive for the real super truckers.<br><br>Volvo is like if Freightliner cared about drivers. I love driving Volvos, lots of extra little touches, like Peterbilt but with a modern Yuro touch. Not sure if servicing them is so easy though.<br><br>Mack is a real small market share these days, not sure what happened to them. I saw like zero new Macks between 2000 and maybe 2015. They\u2019re about on par with Kenworth, some chrome and not the cheapest looking, but they\u2019re like 1% or less of trucks on the road so probably not great if you need service in the middle of the country.", "time": 1670782525, "resto": 26145645, "trip": "!n/ZnkB9jUw"}, {"no": 26156333, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)14:17:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26156121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26156121</a><br>mack is volvo for regional drivers basically. they do otr stuff, about the same level as volvo probably.

With a plotter you can only cut single color stickers or whatever kind of vinyl you can buy. You may stack two layers for two colors but that may or may not look good. It&#039;s also an unnerving kind of detail work. Printer on the other hand gives you tons of options regarding color and design. You just have to design stickers that are not too complicated to cut out later - like square ones for example<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much does that cut into your margin?

This includes secondary effects of eliminating fossil fuel use like a 1/3 reduction in the amount of oceanic shipping, and reductions in fugitive emissions from fossil fuel extraction.<br>That&#039;s not all emissions, but it is a significant amount.<br><br>Even if batteries did only last 5 years before they needed to be recycled, the production cost of the battery in emissions is significantly less than the production cost of a whole car, and right now with only 27% of the US grid being clean baseload energy the pay back period for a whole 100kWh car is less than 2 years.

I wouldn&#039;t pay past $40k for this car though like they&#039;re doing now. It doesn&#039;t cure cancer. It&#039;s just a body on frame SUV with a 20+ year old powertrain and a pretty basic dash/infotainment. It works well for me since I&#039;m a simpleton, but it&#039;s a top complain for a lot of people.

Its pretty much the &#039;boss&#039;s truck&#039; and you can get more luxury features.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

And don&#039;t punch the gas when you are at a lower speed. Powerful cars make use of power at higher speeds. Lower speeds, the car will be so powerful, it will just spin the wheels like crazy, even on amazing tires, on a warm day with good pavement. <br><br>From now on, you must learn to &quot;ease&quot; into the gas, and constantly monitor your car for wheelspin through sound &amp; feeling, while keeping your eyes on the road.<br><br>Eyes must never come off the road when you drive spiritedly. <br><br>You will be able to tell when your car tires let go and start spinning. At that point, you DO NOT hit the brakes, you simply ease off the gas a little bit, and keep looking ahead. If it&#039;s a good handling car, it should catch itself, and grip the road again, and you can proceed normally.<br><br>Losing control happens in a matter of seconds, fractions of a second, even. So you must tread carefully when doing high-speed turns and maneuvers. Eventually, you will learn the car, and be able to push your own limits a little bit more, til you find the point of the car&#039;s own limits where it gets really really dangerous doing something consistently.<br><br>So good tires are everything, but paying attention to road conditions, learning the car itself, watching where you are going, and not going too fast to know what&#039;s around a corner or where your tires lose grip is also essential to not crashing your shit.<br><br>Congrats on the 2SS, I hope you have fun with it.

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.
