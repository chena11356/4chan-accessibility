I hated the one I drove and, again, legroom was an issue in the older models. The older cars also have a reputation of falling off the road backwards in a vicious manner if you&#039;re forced to lift off mid-bend - this tendency has been tamed in the later models by the chassis magicians in Weissach, to the point where they now defy physics - although it&#039;s instructive that they moved the engine in front of the gearbox for the 917, and for the racing 911s. I can drive a modern 911 and contemplated one, but the noise from the rear in the cabin on long journeys would have got wearing, so I passed and bought something else.<br>A 30-yo Ferrari would definitely be fragile, as I said.

Old, like EURO-0 vehicles, are taxed 420\u20ac, EURO-1 are 210\u20ac and EURO-2 are 120\u20ac. EURO-3 and newer are exempt completely. We call it &quot;ekologick\u00fd (eko) poplatek&quot; or &quot;da\u0148&quot; (fee / tax). I guess it&#039;s meant to motivate people to scrap their old smokey cars instead of selling them to another owner if they no longer need them. It went into effect in 2008, when streets were still full of communist-era \u0160kodas (1000, 120, Favorit), Ladas, Trabants, Wartburgs and Fiats. (No Yugos here, though.) People used to sell them literally for a bottle of booze back then, so the eco-tax made it not worth it. The law remained unchanged until today and it doesn&#039;t really make sense anymore, because EURO-2/1/0 cars are pretty rare today, which actually makes them worth a lot more as oldtimers.<br><br>The MOT is pretty thorough but honestly not very strict, though they sure like to pretend it is. You basically have to show up with a vehicle that moves under its own power, has working lights and brakes and isn&#039;t a complete rust bucket. Part of it is also an emission test where the car has to perform as well as the standard model should. As everywhere, there&#039;s usually very little a bit of backhanded cash couldn&#039;t fix. The sad thing is that an engine swap is a big no-no, which puts lots of people off. Generally, there&#039;s very little car tuning here. A vehicle without valid MOT is unroadworthy.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on. Yes, I&#039;m waiting for someone to mention how ironic this is coming from me and my previous fuck up handling order fulfillment, but that&#039;s way beyond the point. <br><br>I understand your frustration, Taiyo and I look at other vendor&#039;s behaviors (and even my own) and try to avoid either repeating mistakes or going down a similar path someone else did. In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support. I&#039;ll repeat, this isn&#039;t a hit piece on them or any other vendor specifically, but you&#039;ll know what to watch out for when you see it enough times.<br><br>Again, I think keeping them is beneficial (unless for reasons including but not limited to the aforementioned for removal).

Again, I&#039;m completely on board with you. If enough people point out that there&#039;s an issue with someone or if there&#039;s evidence of foul play then we&#039;ll take care of it because we don&#039;t want people throwing away their money because we didn&#039;t clean up the site. Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks. My way of rectifying the whole order fulfillment mess is to completely eliminate stamped shipping and pre-orders to minimize lead-times as much as possible and I intend to prove that when the store re-opens and how I reveal products.<br><br>My personal take on your situation is that it&#039;s a mishap, Super Effective and Catch My Drift are basically one entity from my understanding and have a reasonably large following and put out a lot of product with what seems to be mostly satisfied customers.

These are mass-produced shitboxes from 40 years ago. All the richfags have their mint untouched stock versions already so if you get your hands on one of these meme cars why shouldnt you treat it like the meme it is. Making your car look more like an anime or video game car isn&#039;t any different than those fags on /k/ who buy meme wraps for their rifle, or anything else. Most 80s cars were nothing better than an appliance and a lot of these meme shitboxes are built like the cheapest toaster you can find on Amazon. OOHHH maybe it had a decent budget engine and steering rack maybe but its not built to last and treating it like an heirloom is retarded.<br>Me and my friends drilled holes through the trunk cover of a Geo Metro to install a functional bathroom sink on the back of one of our shitboxes. Have fucking fun with your car, especially if it&#039;s a shitbox. If you have a meme shitbox like one of those jdm weebshit cars, then lean into it and put huge stickers of naked 14yr old anime girls on it, why not? its FUN.", "time": 1675483998, "resto": 26323333}, {"no": 26326303, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:19:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325751</a><br>so?", "filename": "__souryuu_asuka_langley_neon_genesis_evangelion_drawn_by_nakasima_syouta_anbooru__9c844a117e78dba10fbee5eb9e753322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 707, "h": 1135, "tn_w": 77, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675495162748013, "time": 1675495162, "md5": "hTSKEz2Xi4R7sL6aEZbw+g==", "fsize": 90656, "resto": 26323333}, {"no": 26326307, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26326303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26326303</a><br><a href=\"#p26325655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325655</a><br>nakadashi", "time": 1675495314, "resto": 26323333}, {"no": 26326496, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)05:19:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Change pants</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Done</span><br>Kill yourself", "time": 1675505998, "resto": 26323333}, {"no": 26326504, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)05:30:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325718</a><br>tfw have a work uniform because I&#039;m an industrial chad", "time": 1675506649, "resto": 26323333}, {"no": 26326567, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:41:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26325751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26325751</a><br>Yeah, and so was I when I first laid eyes on her.

The thing is, high end companies should be making hybrids. There is no reason why hybrids should be slow and fuel efficient. They should just have a car that lives up to Mercedes or Porsche specs on the track but that sometimes uses the gas engine to charge the battery, and sometimes uses the battery for more torque and hey, when the battery is low, just fill it with gas and it charges the battery while you drive. It makes the most sense of any possible fuel technology but not one manufacturer is doing it. That&#039;s how you know it&#039;s all a fucking scam. Fucking lemans cars were hybrids like 10 years ago. You can&#039;t tell me they are slow. And Priuses have been on the road for like 20 years already. Now we know they&#039;re cheap and reliable. So what&#039;s the fucking problem? If you&#039;re a fag about the environment, here&#039;s your answer get a hybrid. If you love your mustang or your hellcat but you wish your 0-60 time was just a little faster, here&#039;s your answer get a hybrid. If you&#039;re a normal guy and you don&#039;t want to spend a ton, you just need someone to get to work and has just enough balls to pass people on the highway, get a hybrid. It would be great for trucks too. But no, everyone wants full ev. For what reason? For what advantage? Literally fucking nothing. And the other thing is, if they actually have half a fuck about the environment they wouldn&#039;t be running fucking car building factors. They would be buying up all cars and reusing everything.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost.

the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

IMO the A4/S4 is better than the S3/A3. The Quattro system in the A4 (ultra) and the S4 (crown/torsen) is worth paying for. <br><br>Quattro ultra has the detached rear axle when you don\u2019t need awd. Audi noticed it\u2019s A4/Q5 customers were thinking in terms of \u2018gee AWD uses more gas so maybe I\u2019ll get FWD and stay home if it snows\u2019 instead of thinking about sporty ness. Since torsen uses .6L of fuel extra per 60km Quattro ultra uses .2L and so it offers the best of both worlds for customers that were torn on Quattro. It\u2019s also exoerimxe better than torsen in the snow/ice as ids faster to get torque where it needs to go. <br>Haldex sucks bad. The engine is all forward of the front axle. It barely sends power rear except in extreme situations and the worst part is it breaks in as little as 10k miles. The A4 ultra is fwd biased like Haldex but the weight is minimal, the engine is mroe rear, the system is much more siphsitaced in terms of engaging the clutch and it\u2019s much more robust and has no issues with reliability. <br><br>The nice thing about the A4 is the current 4 cylinder is very reliable and the water pump meme is covered by a recall. I doubt you have warranty issues to worry about. Since Audi puts engines on the front axle a 4 cylinder is ideal because it\u2019s compact and weighs little so the A4 has a good argument for handling the best. <br>Order an 034 Motorsport rear sway bar and you\u201dll have a very neutral handling car with great awd and a DCT.", "time": 1675352920, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320963, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:54:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320947</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a tuned S6 running bunkers numbers and fully modified suspension and my dealer loves the car and always run my warranty</span><br>just to clarify, you have an S6 that you&#039;ve tuned extensively, broke something in your drivetrain, and they warrantied those repairs? what kind of powertrain repairs did they perform under warranty with your tune?", "time": 1675353258, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320970, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320813</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no r8 for me then</span><br><br>imagine my reaction when i found out the hard way", "filename": "dont", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 231, "h": 218, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1675353346580871, "time": 1675353346, "md5": "7ymVmCpXCYP2C1Vm5r2zNg==", "fsize": 5681, "resto": 26320520}, {"no": 26320973, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)10:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26320963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26320963</a><br>The S3 they replaced the Haldex and rear bumper.

I mainly posted the thread because many people import cars from germany, they are about 20/30% cheaper there but when you pay import fees you maybe save 10%. We have a huge tax here so to buy a new car is really expensive, like 30k for a base peugeot 308, and the average salary is like 12k a year.

Couple that with poor storage techniques of their primary weapons (AIM-7 Sparrow missiles) which led to degradation of the electronics and you have a recipe for disaster.

Manufacturers sell to dealerships who in turn have to pay a loan on the vehicle to the manufacturer in the time it sits on its lot. <br><br>Therefore manufacturer makes money both on the sale of the vehicle to the dealership + the interest paid by the dealership to the manufacturer, and has the additional bonus of the manufacturer dealing with a couple of hundred dealerships vs hundreds of thousands of people.<br><br>Getting rid of this means the manufacturer loses money, as they lose the interest paid and now have to pay for customer service + service centers (See #3)<br><br>2. Selling to dealerships means that there&#039;s a buffer in sales if there&#039;s an economic down turn. If the economy goes tits up, Ford or Honda doesn&#039;t have to layoff their employees, paying them either severance (as most of these operations are unionized) or their unemployment insurance gets jacked up. Either way the company has to pay out through the nose for little or no production if they shut down. If they can keep sending units to their dealerships they avoid this. <br><br>Which also refutes your dumb idea that it would facilitate more sales to customers, If the economy goes tits up, then the manufacturers would make LESS sales than with the dealership network in place. <br><br>3. Service centers cost money to operate, and having dealerships burden the cost, whilst charging them access to the manufacturers parts network Means they don&#039;t have to pay for brick and mortar overhead (which if you had one iota of business knowledge you&#039;d know is fucking expensive) and employing services techs and again still making money off of OEM parts sales. <br><br>4.
