I have big mechanic sausage fingers and it makes removing the belt sprocket bolt annoying.<br><br>Oh yeah and to explain to those who don&#039;t know the 2.0 thermostat/coolant pump:<br>It&#039;s a mostly plastic body with a metal pump bolted to it on the transmission side - the pump being driven by a tiny timing belt off the balance shaft which sticks out towards the rear of the engine for this purpose. I&#039;ve never seen a pump go bad but everyone I&#039;ve seen has codes for the thermostat (either sensor or actuator).

GM V6 engines are solid like the LFX and LGX. Shouldn&#039;t have any reliability issues. Ford gave V6 engines a bad name unfortunately with their trash V6 engines that they had to scrap them and no longer make any V6 Mustangs. Chevy however uses V6 engines all across their lineup. Then you have the manual transmissions for the Mustang which have been notoriously bad that people recommend the 10 speed auto which is actually a good transmission Ford uses. In your case you want manual so again it&#039;s better to stick with the Cammy Whammy. The V6 makes more horsepower than the Ecoboost and since you&#039;ve found it powerful already no point in downgrading to a more stressed out smaller turbocharged engine. Ecoboost also sounds like dogshit compared to the V6. You won&#039;t get around the fact that it sounds distinctly like a 4 cylinder engine which it is compared to the more muscular sounding V6 engine. Camaro is on the outstanding Alpha Platform chassis too. I&#039;d say trust your gut and go for the Camaro and don&#039;t get dissuaded, there&#039;s a reason why you were thinking of going with the Camaro and you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br><br>Here is a LFX swapped Miata doing the burgerking<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eiJ8p<wbr>LIZnJs<br><br>Sound<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8A-7b<wbr>Bn2GKU<br><br>POV drive<br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fTRP<wbr>dJkdp4", "time": 1674024037, "resto": 26266775}, {"no": 26271424, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)07:04:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The 4cyl camero is better than the ecoboost as a track car but worse at being just a regular comfy car with good visibility.

Place the boards in their fully deployed position. In most cases, it may be easier to remove the motors from the motor linkages to allow the steps to fully deploy, and proceed with the rest of the process.<br>2. Verify that the pinch weld holes are lining up with the holes for the linkages. You may need to enlarge the holes in the pinch weld if they do not line up or are catching the bolt threads as you install the steps.<br>3. Verify that the rear of the running board is flush with the rear linkage. If it is not, adjust the running board forward so that the end cap is flush with the linkage.<br>4. Make sure that ALL HARDWARE IS TIGHTENED PROPERLY.<br>5. Have someone walk the length of the board, taking bouncing steps or shifting their weight up and down as they walk. DO NOT JUMP on the running boards. Only shift your weight up and down while moving the entire length of the running board, like you are performing a suspension check.<br>6. With the boards still in the down position, loosen the button head Torx head bolts that go through the pinch weld. DO NOT loosen the hex head bolts on the back of the rocker panel. Then, either have someone sit on the center of the board or put some weight on the center of the board. While there is weight on the board, retighten the button head bolts going through the pinch weld.<br>7.

Vehicles given here aren&#039;t great so this is definitely one of the last areas to do in the entire DLC lineup when you&#039;re better equipped.<br>2: Vehicles are a gimmick used only largely on this map, but the difficulty is interesting at least with mud/snow mix. I like the verticality of this one.<br>3: One of the better areas for starters because the oversized trailers can actually be used rather well here. Hope you like mud, but probably next to Alaska in ease. Vehicles here are kind of nice.<br>4: It&#039;s Season 1 but with even more dickheaded design. You do get the best superheavy truck on this level to compensate. Just like 1, I wouldn&#039;t come here until you have better equipment.<br>Year 2:<br>5: Distilled bullshit starting off. Not as bad once you get the tempo down and get out some decent ground clearance trucks. Trucks unlocked here are okay but nothing to note since you probably have a decent lineup by now.<br>6: Gimmick is a Hardcore-Lite mode until you progress far enough, in which is just becomes like 2 but easier. Trucks you get here are good but unlock way too damn late.<br>7: Easily and without a doubt the single worst DLC of the game. Not really tough but extremely lacking content and feels like recycled assets from the Dakar game they (then) recently released. Vehicles really only work on this level and nowhere else in the game, and the whole level is so short with content you could 100% it in a session or two.<br>8: Tries to redeem the failure of 7 by adding four massive areas to drive around in.

It&#039;s an okay performing truck but I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s mandatory or good except if you want to be a completionist.<br>Chevy Apache: Similar to the Navistar in that it&#039;s like a truck you will get later on (YAR in vanilla) unlocked earlier to dominate early game.<br>CAT CT681/International HX 520: Arguably the best premiums because of being free, they make excellent support trucks.

Will fuck you if you play Hard mode due to the extra maintenance costs.<br>Tatra 813/805: You&#039;ll get this one automatically on buying the Year 1 pass. 805 makes for a very good heavy offroad truck until you get a larger toolset to use. Personally used it for the GOAT Zikz on Season 4.<br>Jeeps: Mediocre scouts with not much ability, even to haul trailers. Might be fine in light dirt but are very useless to do anything serious.<br>Crocodile: Makes for a good resupply truck, one of the better premiums actually.

If it was still early on you could argue the Navistar is an unbalanced preorder truck but it too has problems like no diff lock and chugs fuel like a motherfucker. Play it similar to the CAT by slamming it in high on highrange and letting it boulder through terrain rather than sink in.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

Note the difference in alternator mounting for one. Now it could be an L98 under all that other stuff but Occam&#039;s Razor suggests that they simply swung a 90&#039;s 5.0/5.7 TBI truck engine in there as being the simplest explanation.

I expect both C7s and C8s are going to plummet once Chevy gets on top of C8 supply. C7s because they&#039;re really nothing that special and C8s because they&#039;re hyperinflated right now and so even selling for MSRP is going to make people lose tens of thousands overnight.<br><br>However, at present, C4, 5, and 6 are all great buys, especially 5. I&#039;m partial because I own one, but the C5 is less complicated and all around more reliable than the C4, but isn&#039;t quite as needlessly techy as the C6 so avoids that bullshit (electronic door opening and other needless shit like that). In fact, I&#039;d say the C5 is the simplest modern (i.e. electronic fuel injected) Corvette you can buy, which will make it the cheapest and easiest to own over time as there&#039;s less to break.

Starts up at half a turn. Turbo is fine, injectors are fine, pump I assume is fine, fuel filter checked and changed, all fuel lines inspected and all the wiring too. Air intake and vacuum lines checked. New battery and alternator as the old alternator died recently. Also exhaust gasses are within spec as I had her tested in the road test center. <br>Now the first problem.<br>Car will stutter randomly when driving. Usually it&#039;s like 3-4 stutters that are pretty violent, feels like the whole engine cuts out, she will keep driving normally after that. It can happen once in an hour of driving or every other minute. Sometimes it&#039;s so often I feel like she will just die on the road. That&#039;s any rpm as long as you are accelerating or the car accelerates herself (to keep the speed), no difference whether engine is cold or under optimal temperature. Outside factors are also irrelevant, it doesn&#039;t matter if its cold, hot or raining.
