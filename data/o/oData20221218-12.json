Incredibly simple, yet it works on multiple levels.<br>For one it tests if you have a concept of delayed reward. Reverse parking is slightly more difficult and time consuming than forward parking for a novice. Yet when you come to leave, driving forwards out of a space onto a busy street or parking lot is infinitely easier than backing out and being unable to see what&#039;s coming. The payoff is well worth it.<br>But that&#039;s not all<br>Reverse parking is easier than forward once you practice, but more difficult initially. So it is also a laziness test. Someone who gives no shits about what is better in the long run or improving themselves will always choose the lazy option of badly forward parking because it is &quot;easier and quicker&quot;, and they will spend their entire life doing that.<br>For those that aren&#039;t filtered by the laziness and intelligence test it actually works out even better once you practice due to the way cars turn. While going forwards the rear end follows the front and cuts the corner trailing behind you. You have little control over this. So to forward park properly, you have to swing the front out wide (which you don&#039;t always have room for) so that the rear end can cut the corner and end up in the right place. Most forward parkers are too stupid to realise this, so they end up backing out and in again multiple times or they just leave the car at a stupid angle they initially pulled in at.<br>On the contrary, while going backwards your car becomes rear steering. By thinking ahead you can make very tight turns and still end up placing the rear of the car exactly where it needs to be then correcting the placement of the front of the car in the same motion<br><br>Tl;dr being able to rear-park is a retard test", "time": 1671364524, "resto": 26174170}, {"no": 26176243, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There are a few reasons why backing into a parking space may be considered better than driving into a parking space head-on:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Improved visibility: </span><br>When you reverse park, you have a better view of your surroundings because you are facing the opposite direction.

Two were BMWs, one of which had the ZF 6HP, the other had a GM 6L45R in it. Both were very easy to service. Drain the pan (optionally remove pan for filter change), refill through the fill port with a pump. Easy as shit. Once the fluid starts to pour out the fill, just start the engine, then start pumping it in again. Use a scanner to watch transmission temp, once it hits the specified temp, and fluid is just dribbling out of the fill, plug it back up. <br><br>I&#039;ve got two Fords now with 6R80s, its pretty similar, except they have this little dipstick you have to fiddlefuck with that is close to the exhaust which is obviously very hot at operating temps. Put on some gloves for these. Also, no drain plug. Otherwise, no big deal, pretty easy to service.<br><br>Meanwhile, I&#039;ve got an old Chevy Express with a 4L80E in it. Absolutely fuck that transmission sideways with a pineapple. No drain plug, and while it has a dipstick, it is absolutely impossible to read. This cocksucker is 8 feet long, made of tinfoil, and feeding it back into the tube is like sticking a wet spaghetti noodle up a cat&#039;s ass, and half the time it binds up in the tube before getting back in all the way.

It seems the main thing delaying it is Tesla thought there would be more progress at higher capacity batteries, but most of the R&amp;D recently (even their own) has been put towards lower cost / safer / longer lifespan batteries to deal with the supply chain issues and keep up with the crazy demand for mainstream models.

At a cost of $30 million dollars, a fully independent Lotus-designed suspension upgraded the 1988 Fiero&#039;s chassis, which finally let the car live up to its performance potential: shorter spindles, smaller scrub radius, reduction of the kingpin angle, longer A-arms, and a 28mm: anti-roll bar replaced the Chevette pieces at the nose. A new subframe with different attaching points, a three-link design, lower spring rates &amp; a 22mm anti-roll bar did away with dated X-car components in the rear, and it received vented disk brakes and staggered wheels for improved handling balance. These improvements mean that the 1988 model year is the most sought after - and the rarest. The last Fiero rolled off the assembly line in Pontiac, MI on August 16, 1988 after only 6,848 Fiero GTs were produced for that model year.</span>", "time": 1671329406, "resto": 26175141}, {"no": 26175159, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)21:10:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26175153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26175153</a><br>Post car", "time": 1671329423, "resto": 26175141}, {"no": 26175164, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)21:12:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26175141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26175141</a><br>I really want this one", "filename": "f2-1561481986[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1750, "h": 1165, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671329527937418, "time": 1671329527, "md5": "IMGAO8T3HnR2VW6W/F5VtA==", "fsize": 273151, "resto": 26175141}, {"no": 26175168, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)21:13:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26175159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26175159</a><br>Kek, no.

You know how in movies most of the important characters are attractive? Good-looking people exist in real life too, but you&#039;re unlikely to find such a concentration of beautiful people in real life as you do in Hollywood movies. It&#039;s kind of like that with the cars in those movies. Yes, you could see cars on the street like the ones in the movies, but it would be unusual to see so many that take it quite so far as the ones in the movies. For what it&#039;s worth, I consider that style to be more of a 90&#039;s thing than an early 00&#039;s thing, by the way. By the early 00&#039;s, it was already on the way out, and the dotcom crash / small recession around 2002 killed it in the US, imo. For a positive portrayal of that scene, visit your local library and see if they have old copies of Sports Compact Car magazine from the late 90&#039;s.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door.

I\u2019m a pretty weak guy, not very physical. Just about in shape enough to control a car through a tight bend at speed, not much else. I was concerned about that so i asked my friend who has been riding superbikes for years and he told me it\u2019s kinda like skiing. As soon as i heard that i realized i\u2019d die on a bike, i suck at skiing. But good for you guys, bikes at least seem uncucked in today\u2019s age. They still are loud, fun, dangerous. Maybe i should hit the gym and reconsider, but that\u2019s a different topic. Anyway, i just want something new that even comes close to an S2000. Something to rev up, shift gears myself, let the tail out a bit. Idgaf about doing illegal speeds or winning quarter miles or showing off at track days. It should not be that hard. That car came out 20 years ago! I\u2019m sure they could just make the same thing but with cheaper modern materials, turbo the engine and tune it a bit to meet emissions, give it a pigfat hood to cushion pedestrians, and call it a day. I bet Honda could make something like that from parts bins for like 20 grand. I get it that emissions laws and the chip shortage make it difficult to keep costs down, but there is no law in Europe i know of requiring backup cameras or Apple carplay or stupid fugly ACC systems. Local dealerships haven\u2019t even gotten the new 86s yet, but i bet you they\u2019ll be going for like 40. Wtf? How much can it cost to make that piece of shit?

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated?

As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims.
