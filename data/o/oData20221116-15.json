We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers.

It is smoother over bumps, yet has less roll when cornering and is more responsive to steering input. Also the base i4 in the new one is more powerful than the v6 in the old one, and the newer transmission definitely allows it to make better use of that power. It also has better brakes. The car just has better performance in every way.

And when it comes to power tools, a drill + impact driver kit are good first steps for any DIYer. Stick a socket adapter on the impact driver and it will do the same thing as any 3/8\u201d impact wrench. And when you get into wrenching more, then think about a 1/2\u201d impact wrench to speed up wheels and to help with stubborn large fasteners.<br><br>For hand tools, most of the mid range stuff comes out of the same couple Taiwanese factories so you can\u2019t go wrong if you find a good deal on Husky or Kobalt or Craftsman. Tekton is solid. I like Gearwrench because they add a couple small touches on some of their tools that are good for /o/ stuff. Those Milwaukee wrenches are newer, they look nice but they\u2019re expensive for Asian made tools. When the socket sets are on sale for 50% off, it looks like a good buy, but at full price you could get a premium US made set like SK for only a few bucks more. <br><br>Also when you start getting to the power tools, can\u2019t go wrong with Ryobi. Milwaukee has a great selection but is going to cost you. Meanwhile Ryobi has a huge lineup of DIYer tier tools that should be fine. The newest Ryobi HP stuff is like 90% the performance of Milwaukee for half the price, and if there\u2019s a cordless tool you want but will only be using once or twice a year as a DIYer, you can get the cheaper Ryobi non-HP version.

I learned my lesson. The CDI caused a lot of weird problems that I couldn&#039;t figure out. Most importantly, it was killing the engine. I know it wasn&#039;t a rev issue even though I&#039;d been waiting on the tachometer in the mail, because the engine never sounded like it had surpassed the old peak. I only rode it very gently at low speed a handful of times while testing it. The engine was dying as it revved down, specifically. Whenever I&#039;d roll towards a stop, or revved below 3/4 throttle, in both cases only after running the bike for 10 minutes or so, it would die. Couldn&#039;t figure it out, but the problem was immediately fixed after I got rid of the CDI. One of the plugs on the wires was a casualty though, and I had to carefully solder it back on, which is why I was worried there might be a circuit bleed. I had thought that circuit bleeds have to be discharging through an obvious ground path. The blue plastic splice lock thing that came with the CDI didn&#039;t seem to do that and still killed the battery. Someone above suggested it might&#039;ve been the CDI itself pulling energy from the battery.
