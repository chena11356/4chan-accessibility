Everything ultimately must be done. <br>Cars are simply one of the first on the agenda because they have a relatively short service life, the tun-around time to designing them is shorter, the technology to achieve 100% replacement with BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs already exists, and countries have jurisdiction over new cars sold in their territory. <br>Unlike for instance ships where the technology exists but ships often fly a flag of convenience and aren&#039;t subject to local laws, or Airplanes where hydrogen and battery based aircraft are still in early development.<br><br>The phase out of internal combustion engine cars as daily use vehicles, and fossil fuel power over the next 30 years, in favor of clean nuclear power and vehicles run from that will eliminate about 20GT of annual emissions. This includes secondary effects of eliminating fossil fuel use like a 1/3 reduction in the amount of oceanic shipping, and reductions in fugitive emissions from fossil fuel extraction.<br>That&#039;s not all emissions, but it is a significant amount.<br><br>Even if batteries did only last 5 years before they needed to be recycled, the production cost of the battery in emissions is significantly less than the production cost of a whole car, and right now with only 27% of the US grid being clean baseload energy the pay back period for a whole 100kWh car is less than 2 years. In a few decades when nuclear power is more than 40% of the grid that payback period will be even shorter.<br>Especially when you consider that in fact current generation EV batteries last 20+ years in their automotive phase, and then a decade or more longer in home storage applications.", "filename": "c6q4p9bfxtr71", "ext": ".png", "w": 3436, "h": 2146, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671771466547174, "time": 1671771466, "md5": "6pZnJ/3TJH1rpkuRpcXjgw==", "fsize": 2664925, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189365, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:11:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189098</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;average car</span><br>Leaf is a shitbox and not average.<br>Now factor in increased electricity prices and battery replacement cost.", "time": 1671779474, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189368, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:12:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189102</a><br>Nobody cares, take a deep breath.", "filename": "want a smoke", "ext": ".webm", "w": 864, "h": 992, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671779546463768, "time": 1671779546, "md5": "67p9TjkKSGmAi0tG8H0Hvg==", "fsize": 1231876, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189506, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26188071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26188071</a><br>wrong", "time": 1671784066, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189609, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:22:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189141</a><br>That infographic is a heaping load of shit, quit spamming it at every opportunity no one believes your blatant shilling", "time": 1671787368, "resto": 26188071}, {"no": 26189627, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:34:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189141</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IEA</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global Carbon Project</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IPCC</span><br>Oh gee I sure am willing to gobble up and believe all the bullshit that pro-EV goyim organisations put on my screen!

answer would be that they need to have the infrastructure in place so that in the future when we have a clean energy source, we can just connect that to the charging stations. <br><br>like for example yes coal burning and oil burning electric power plants are bad for the environment, but maybe they will find a way to make safe nuclear plants and then if we used that for electric power, we already have all the wires and the charging stations ready to go and people don&#039;t have to buy new cars because electricity is electricity. <br><br>whereas if everyone still has gas cars, even if we find a cleaner liquid combustible fuel its not gonna work in regular gas engines. they would have to redesign the engines, kind of like how diesel and gas engines are different. <br><br>again i dont

The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.[8] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada,[9] then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.[10] The offer, which conflicted with Subaru&#039;s reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.[11]<br><br><br>Toyota FT-86 Concept (2009)<br>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota&#039;s ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.[12]<br><br>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.[13] The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.[14]<br><br>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project.&quot;", "time": 1671487635, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180070, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26179969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26179969</a><br>The problem with the miata is that its a more fun daily on the road but much worse in togues and circuits, and funny enough, the gr86 is better as a daily because it has a fuckton of space in comparison to the miata", "time": 1671487800, "resto": 26179837}, {"no": 26180077, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;slow for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;low top speed for a &quot;sports car&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitbaru engine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touch infotainment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weird tire dimensions</span><br>Yeah.. no.

Its pretty much the &#039;boss&#039;s truck&#039; and you can get more luxury features.

What you said is either cosmetic or minor damage. But overall, it\u2019s a good car. <br><br>Power steering noise? Most likely low fluid, you can top it off until you can fix it. Bad hood struts? Doesn\u2019t really affect the car itself. If you\u2019re that worried, either replace them or put in a manual hood prop(later is cheaper and lasts longer). Wheel damage? As long as it\u2019s cosmetic, I wouldn\u2019t worry. You\u2019re buying an older car, cosmetic things like are inescapable. Tires and TPMS? If you get them replaced, they\u2019ll swap the sensors too most likely. Coolant? Borrow a pressure test pump from an auto parts store if you\u2019re that worried about a leak. They\u2019ll most likely have one for Toyota. As for the engine covers under the hood. You don\u2019t really need them, it\u2019s just cosmetic. If it\u2019s the little plastic push pins that are missing, that\u2019s almost normal. People lose them all the time when working on Toyotas, putting them in properly is a slight pain. <br>I would say, check underneath the car, they are known for rust. Look at the suspension components, sway bar links, bushings. Check for leaks on the diffs, oil pan, power steering rack, transfer case, and transmission. <br>Minor thing I do is check the air filter.

With a plotter you can only cut single color stickers or whatever kind of vinyl you can buy. You may stack two layers for two colors but that may or may not look good. It&#039;s also an unnerving kind of detail work. Printer on the other hand gives you tons of options regarding color and design.

This made the Model A much more versatile and appealing to a wider range of customers.<br><br>In addition to offering more body styles, the Model A also featured a more powerful and reliable engine than the Model T.

Doctors, stockbrokers, lawyers and entrepreneurs gather every June to share their common addiction for speed and competition. <br><br>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a cast of excessively funded amateurs appeared in American sports car racing. As it would transpire, Don and Bill Whittington, John Paul and Randy Lanier, were funding their racing illegally. All would be arrested for separate drug trafficking and tax evasion offences by the end of 1986. <br><br>Racing alongside John Paul and Randy Lanier in the latest Porsche 934s and 935s, the Whittington\u2019s maximised their on-track potential with seemingly endless budget for top equipment. In 1976, Porsche 934 race cars could be acquired from Weissach for $40,000 dollars. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) believed the Whittington drug trafficking operation generated $73 million in revenue. So, cash flow was no issue for Team Whittington.<br>The Whittington\u2019s opulence stretched further than their exotic race cars. During the 1978 season, Road Atlanta racetrack appeared as a solitary sponsor on the Whittington\u2019s Porsche 934 and 935. Having acquired the Braselton facility, the brothers used the circuit\u2019s extensive back straight to indulge another of their excessive passions, airplanes. It was not uncommon for Don Whittington to call in and order for racing activities to be paused while he landed his private aircraft on the circuit. Just a couple of years later, the Whittington\u2019s quietly sold Road Atlanta to Randy Lanier, a fellow racer and kingpin of his own drug smuggling operation. Lanier\u2019s rationale for acquiring the circuit was simple. Testing his growing fleet of race cars, and laundering money.", "time": 1671804566, "resto": 26189173}, {"no": 26190034, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)09:09:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26189941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26189941</a><br>Enjoy.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

Take care of the car, and it will take care of you. Most common issues I&#039;ve seen are crankcase vent failure and the upper electronic module failing. A failed crankcase vent will cause excessive oil consumption and if ignored for long enough will cause the cam seals to rupture and leak oil onto the timing belt. If you don&#039;t want to bend all 20 of your valves, replace your crankcase vent as soon as you know it has failed. Common signs of failure are bad oil consumption (check your dipstick regularly between oil changes), oil cap and dipstick are hard to remove during engine idle at operating temperature, or if the rubber hose connected to the charge pipe is covered in oil. The plastic pipe over the valve cover, and the hose connects at the bottom by the radiator fan. I typically only see upper electronic module (UEM) failure on old pieces of shit that come in with SRS lights. Worn shocks and leaking CV axle boots are common too, but that&#039;s because the cars are just old.<br><br>There&#039;s currently a recall out for the steering wheel airbag because it doesn&#039;t deploy exactly how Volvo wants it to. If the airbag is dark grey and the plastic cover feels fairly new, safe to say the recall has been performed.<br><br>If you&#039;re a DIYer, be aware that parts aren&#039;t exactly cheap, and if they are they most likely suck. Stick to OEM, or if you&#039;re looking for aftermarket upgrades IPD is the way to go. If you take your car to shops, find a Volvo specialist or just take your car to a Volvo dealer. It will be more expensive obviously, but most mechanics are scared to work on Volvos for some reason.

You&#039;re buying a time bomb.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PCV system</span><br>It likes to clog up with carbon and the resulting crankcase pressure will blow the front cam seals right out of the head. If you see oil at the bottom of the timing cover, walk away. Chances are you&#039;ll be replacing more than just the cam seals (which is a timing belt job plus a couple hours by itself).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suspension</span><br>You likely won&#039;t see any big issues until you hit 150-200k but prepare your anus when you do. All the ball joints/bushings are integrated into the control arms and the arms are NOT cheap, nor are they fun to replace.<br>Front axles fail about as often as any other car, you&#039;ll never have to touch the rears if it even has them.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Electrical</span><br>I don&#039;t see a lot of electrical gremlins but if it has halogen headlights the bulb connectors like to burn up. If left long enough the wire insulation inside the headlight assembly will start to bake and crumble.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regular maintenance</span><br>Assuming everything checks out, here&#039;s what you need to plan for:<br>-Oil changes every 5k miles or less, use low-SAPS oil if possible to avoid PCV issue.<br>-Timing belt/water pump every 105k miles. Don&#039;t drag this out, I&#039;ve seen more than one timing belt break between 105-106k and these are interference engines. The water pump will likely fail before the interval, however.<br>-Transmission fluid should be changed every 40-60k miles. The filter is effectively non-serviceable so you have to keep the fluid fresh as a result. If it&#039;s AWD, change the t-case oil every 100k (it&#039;s basically just a differential, takes regular gear oil).

If you&#039;re serious about wanting to join one, IMO the best way to get on one is to go to larger racing events and just get your name out as much as possible. Stop in at tents and ask if they need help with dumb menial shit. Shoot the shit with the guys about the car. This is assuming you sort of know your way around cars already and are not a total sperg. Most will say no, but occasionally, you&#039;ll be in the right place at the right time and you can jam your foot in the door. I know a couple of buddies who got on teams doing stuff like that and they had a blast all summer.

The cost of rent to house all of that shit alone would cost more than I pay a mechanic in a year since I&#039;m not a retard and don&#039;t break my cars. The only time fixing shit yourself is cheaper is when you live out in the country and the mechanic is an hour away and would require a multi-hundred dollar tow and you have a big ass barn already you can carve out a corner of to do car shit with. I live in a city and I&#039;m lucky to have a 1 car garage for my motorcycles and the few tools I do have. Meanwhile, I have amazing mechanics less than 10 minutes away from my townhome. There&#039;s just no reason for me to invest in the shit to DIY when it&#039;s literally cheaper to pawn it on them. And you act like the law wouldn&#039;t be on my side if they broke my shit.", "time": 1671665932, "resto": 26182659}, {"no": 26185617, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:48:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185176</a><br>Few very important points:<br><br>1) PCs, drones, and RC cars don&#039;t require specialized tools or heavy lifting and they can all be worked on at a coffee table if you want usually with a $10-$20 tool kit. Also, most do it out of necessity because there aren&#039;t many places that even offer repair/building services for drones and RC cars and most PC shops are more geared towards fixing pre-built computers than customizing one. If you get stuck and can&#039;t finish, you won&#039;t have an HOA screeching at you for having a partially disassembled car in sight of the public or not be able to get to work/school/grocery store/etc. and have spend hundreds towing it to a repair shop.<br><br>2) There are tons of PC gaming enthusiasts that don&#039;t build their own computers or have any desire to. They either buy prebuilts or pay a company to put their computer together and for most I don&#039;t blame them. I&#039;ve seen what a shit show a lot of first time builders do to their computers and they&#039;re better off having someone experienced do it. I have the knowledge to build a PC, but every time I consider it I end up finding a prebuilt on sale that has the same or better parts for less and end up getting that instead. Like the car, I get no enjoyment or satisfaction of putting it together, I only do it if it&#039;s overwhelmingly less expensive or convenient (i.e. I&#039;m not driving to a computer shop to have them swap a graphics card, LOL). In fact, the biggest thing keeping me from upgrading my 1070 to a 3080 right now is because I&#039;d also need to upgrade the power supply and I really don&#039;t want to have to unplug dozens of ports and dig the computer out (almost every port is used and it&#039;s behind my FFB steering wheel setup and other stuff), have to re-reroute all of the cables for a new power supply, hope neither the new power supply or used 3080 have issues, and have to put it all back all to find out the 3080 might be bottlenecked by the rest of the computer.", "time": 1671666537, "resto": 26182659}, {"no": 26185739, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:46:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26185596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26185596</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In pro racing it&#039;s simply because contact is inevitable.</span><br>Pit crew wrench monkeys take apart every car after a race and rebuild it before the next one in actual pro racing.
