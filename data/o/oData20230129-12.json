They&#039;ve been busting ass to get orders out now that the bikes have been let out of the port. My opinions so far are that it&#039;s a good start for them. I admire that even though they had to reverse course on a few things (like the quick release battery) they delivered most of what was promised. The biggest issue is the ergonomics. The seat unironically feels like it&#039;s made out of wood, the suspension is rock hard and not adjustable. I hear some weird intermittent noises when riding, but nothing that concerns me. The brakes are unimpressive especially the rear which might as well not even be there. It&#039;s great for urban and suburban riding and I took it out on my favorite twisty road to get that picture and it was pretty nimble out there as well.

You may not like the facts but that&#039;s the reality.<br><br>The only reason that electric cars have caught on is they don&#039;t need subsidies for their operating costs. Meanwhile biodiesel, ethanol, synthetic fuels, or hydrogen haven&#039;t caught on because all of those alternatives for running internal combustion engines can&#039;t compete against heavily subsidized fossil fuels without major subsidies of their own, and none of them have the kind of nation wide lobbying power that fossil fuels have to make that happen.<br>Nobody is going to pay $.21 a mile to drive on hydrogen when gasoline is $.10 a mile. But if electric cars are still $.04 a mile even with all the extra fees they pay then its no question why people are switching.<br>Simple economics.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

I don&#039;t have a fantastic selection of manual compactish cars around me so out of everything I&#039;ve seen I&#039;m currently leaning towards a clean looking 2002 Sentra Ser V with the 2.5 with really low miles (~140k km). <br>The owner says that it burns some oil but other than that, it&#039;s in pretty good shape. <br>Reading online it sounds like this year of this nissan model was fairly well made and reliable, with mostly non critical issues with the car, and some cases of the engine burning oil. The car doesn&#039;t look like it was owned by a kid who beat on it, it looks fairly well kept and with minimal changes (no retarded mods). <br>Is there some way I can determine how much oil the thing burns during an inspection and test drive? <br><br>Assuming there&#039;s nothing else wrong with the drivetrain, I&#039;d be fine with it burning a little bit like a quart between oil changes, not a quart a week. <br>Any advice for this car, is it good, should I stay away?", "filename": "1674611773734902 pugthink", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 786, "h": 771, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1674946068502981, "time": 1674946068, "md5": "z9GJNNDhQJI9ArLyzfWIUQ==", "fsize": 115797, "resto": 26276703}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26302600, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:43:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tomorrow is LMDh&#039;s litmus test.

The post-cat sensor holds mostly constant voltage when the cat is doing its job and removing most of the toxic material from the exhaust gas.

Pic related is a brand new 2023 Ford F-150 single-cab long bed which you can build off Ford&#039;s website and buy right now, I think the bed size is about a foot shorter than the 1961-1979 year model F100s... <br>Are these retards really this ill-informed? I mean I get it, crew cab short beds is the popular option now, but you still can buy a single cab long bed F-150 if you wanted one.", "filename": "818a32e3b0aba987e3fe14ac758a1d4e", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674882245020345, "time": 1674882245, "md5": "R8RTCNyfHPDR5O/PYkdP+Q==", "fsize": 149647, "resto": 26302751}, {"no": 26304021, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)04:12:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26303516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26303516</a><br>You are a tard.
