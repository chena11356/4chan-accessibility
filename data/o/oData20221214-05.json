If you need one, get the chink one for 50 bucks off aliexpress or probably dropshipped to Amazon, or if you know how to use a soldering iron you can pick up an old G25/27 one and an arduino for 20 bucks.

Sure, you can get one, but it&#039;s going to be an extra 100-200 bucks and not really be that good, screwing the pedals down to a bit of wood and lashing them to your office chair will be fine and any old desk you&#039;ve got is good enough for the wheelbase.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This would be one of the many decisions that would bleed the brand over the next few decades.<br>When the big three of Japan decided to come out with their bespoke luxury brands, Mitsubishi decided there was no need for this despite having basically no clout in the American market, they made fleet and commuter vehicles. This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims. We know now that even this engine struggled to power the AWD system of the over 3500 lb car which wasn&#039;t helped by the two turbochargers. What&#039;s stranger is that the 6G74 3.5 V6 was dropped in multiple Mitsubishi vehicles, SUVs and sedans, and was able to approach the twin-turbo 6G72 in power in NA form.<br>During the height of the Fast and Furious tuner hype, Mitsubishi cut corners and made the third generation Eclipse FWD only, but let you have a V6. <br>The company would spend the 2000s and 2010s producing shitty commuter cars for the states, the market they invested so much into entering through the Chrysler partnership.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door. My hope is that between a coolant system flush, a heater core backflush, a new blend door actuator, and a new blend door heat to the cab can be restored.", "time": 1670472295, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26146386, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)23:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>This has to be a troll.

No reason to go to 1/2 as it is too big for not that much gain.<br>Here&#039;s a good kit to get you started - https://a.co/d/bMkscuu<br>Also TTC video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBQ<wbr>paUBMmGw<br>Whatever you do, DON&#039;T USE MILTON FITTINGS THEY FUCKING SUCK.", "time": 1670642705, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26152169, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)00:01:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>Dont worry about other anon, probably butthurt that someone can enjoy fixing things.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

I say &#039;almost universal because while my throttle housing had one M8\u00d71.25 thread that fitted perfectly the throttle return is a M10\u00d7 1.25 thread, I figured out I could just drill and tap the end of the old cable.

I only put 50k on it though (wasn&#039;t my only car) so things might be different with higher mileage models, but it was generally the most reliable, trouble-free car I&#039;ve ever owned. <br>As far as I know the main years for engine problems were &#039;14 and &#039;15, which had a potential coolant loss issue that could cause a cracked head. Ford did a recall to add a head temp warning light. After that I&#039;m only aware of people blowing headgaskets with significant power upgrades. <br>Personally I&#039;d try to get at least a 2017 and avoid the earlier ones. Aside from the engine issue those later ones also have Sync 3 instead of Sync 2, which is a big upgrade and gives you Android Auto/CarPlay so you basically never have to deal with Ford&#039;s factory stuff at all.

To be more accurate: Bacteria developed in the lacquer pools. They changed the behavior of the lacquer so it hat a lower cohesion especially at very narrow parts like the underside of the doors. <br>That being said: <br>1) Not every 210 had this problem. The lacquer pools got refilled every week or other week. Only cars who went through the pool when the lacquer was already a few days old (= lots oc bacteria) had this problem.<br>2) Every 210 who had this problem has already rusted away many years ago. We are talking about the 00s and early 10s. Don&#039;t forget that the 210 only ran between 1995 and 2002.<br>So today there&#039;s honestly no reason to be overly afraid of rust since what&#039;s still left has a normal rust-level just like you&#039;d expect from a 20+X years old car. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;electronics are a mess</span><br>Somewhat true but then again: Every car&#039;s electronics are a mess if they have been designed and built so many decades ago. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you manage to preserve a good AMG</span><br>Most if not all AMGs on the market have had many users and are more than often beat to shit.

I for example really adore the lines of the 210, especially the rear part. But just like back in the days there are also lots of people who hate the headlight design. <br>It will be a good investment if you take care of it. They are still really cheap because they are too young to be considered real classics, unlike 124s. But I guess we&#039;re only a few years away from a time where 210s get that attention too.<br>Never forget: Back in the days NOBODY thought that 123s or 124s would become sought-after classics in the future.

That\u2019s 3 months we\u2019re down a van that needs to be driving to job sites every day to pay for its own existence. In the meantime, one of the metris vans has decided it sometimes won\u2019t start due to an electrical issue, all of the metris vans have killed their rear tires very quickly because they won\u2019t hold an alignment with any weight in them, and we got a fuel leak recall on 2 vans that Mercedes can\u2019t get parts for.

In my little town you used to be able to take the trolley from the north end to the south end, and also get on a commuter train to go to the nearby big city. We HAD all of this. Today the rightofways for these old rails have either been reclaimed by adjacent lots or turned into walking trails (that nobody actually uses.) When I was a kid in the 1980s the rails were all still there, and by the time I was in high school in the early 90s they were all but gone. Today you can only tell where the trolleys used to be because the avenues they were on are a little wider and have really old oak trees lining them. It&#039;s crazy that we all have to sit around and wonder how the fuck to make this happen like we aren&#039;t as smart as the people 100 years ago who put it all in in the first place. In the nearby city we&#039;ve finally got a streetcar line that&#039;s expanding, and it makes visiting the city really convenient, where even just fifteen years ago parking was a goddamn nightmare to do anything there.

I own my car, not the bank, and I get over 40 mpg regularly. It would take $10+ per gallon gas and other high costs and strong arming from the government to get me off the road.
