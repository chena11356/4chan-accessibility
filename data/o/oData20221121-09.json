I will admit that he has some QC issues here and there with misprints, but I usually toss those aside if I can identify them. I would like to ask what cleaner you used on your glass before applying the sticker as most adhesion failures are due to improper cleaning. Personally, I have had Waifusquad&#039;s Panty &amp; Stocking holo stickers survive two PA winters with salt and PA summers sitting in the sun 24/7 street parking and only suffered very slight peeling at one edge when I first put the stickers on. I do not know if he used the same printer at the time. I should also mention I had two misprints from him with the same design and those had terrible adhesion but I chalk that up to them being misprints. Keep in mind, I cleaned the surface properly and applied all stickers on the same day/conditions as well. Sometimes you just get unlucky. Anyhow, if you ever end up with image attached or something along these lines AFTER good surface prep, send me an e-mail and I will replace the sticker.", "filename": "20200619_151834", "ext": ".jpg",
