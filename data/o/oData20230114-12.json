Vehicles given here aren&#039;t great so this is definitely one of the last areas to do in the entire DLC lineup when you&#039;re better equipped.<br>2: Vehicles are a gimmick used only largely on this map, but the difficulty is interesting at least with mud/snow mix. I like the verticality of this one.<br>3: One of the better areas for starters because the oversized trailers can actually be used rather well here. Hope you like mud, but probably next to Alaska in ease. Vehicles here are kind of nice.<br>4: It&#039;s Season 1 but with even more dickheaded design. You do get the best superheavy truck on this level to compensate. Just like 1, I wouldn&#039;t come here until you have better equipment.<br>Year 2:<br>5: Distilled bullshit starting off. Not as bad once you get the tempo down and get out some decent ground clearance trucks. Trucks unlocked here are okay but nothing to note since you probably have a decent lineup by now.<br>6: Gimmick is a Hardcore-Lite mode until you progress far enough, in which is just becomes like 2 but easier. Trucks you get here are good but unlock way too damn late.<br>7: Easily and without a doubt the single worst DLC of the game. Not really tough but extremely lacking content and feels like recycled assets from the Dakar game they (then) recently released. Vehicles really only work on this level and nowhere else in the game, and the whole level is so short with content you could 100% it in a session or two.<br>8: Tries to redeem the failure of 7 by adding four massive areas to drive around in.

This was the preorder DLC which dominates Michigan/early game, but very quickly falls off later.<br>Brigadier: This is just a slightly fancier version of the GMC truck you get from Michigan. It&#039;s an okay performing truck but I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s mandatory or good except if you want to be a completionist.<br>Chevy Apache: Similar to the Navistar in that it&#039;s like a truck you will get later on (YAR in vanilla) unlocked earlier to dominate early game.<br>CAT CT681/International HX 520: Arguably the best premiums because of being free, they make excellent support trucks. The CAT 681 when upgraded with a good engine and highrange is one of the best trucks in the game for moving quick.<br>Western Star 49X: A big fat heavy truck that is only really good for pulling large trailers. Will fuck you if you play Hard mode due to the extra maintenance costs.<br>Tatra 813/805: You&#039;ll get this one automatically on buying the Year 1 pass. 805 makes for a very good heavy offroad truck until you get a larger toolset to use.

Lot of the premium trucks are actually not that good, the CAT CT681 is one of my most used trucks because it&#039;s got an incredibly power/weight ratio and highrange slams through all but heavy mud and snow, and best part is it&#039;s free. If it was still early on you could argue the Navistar is an unbalanced preorder truck but it too has problems like no diff lock and chugs fuel like a motherfucker. Play it similar to the CAT by slamming it in high on highrange and letting it boulder through terrain rather than sink in. Even with just the Year 1 pass the game dumps the Bandit on you and the 805, which is more than enough to get the Zikz.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lake Kovd</span><br>It is a tough area, but it really is a very pretty area and the borealis at night also helps.

Also, if you don&#039;t have a car, you&#039;re stuck. From my suburban home, there isn&#039;t a single sidewalk to anything. I love cars, but I also love being outside, exploring and discovering new things around my city without being trapped in a metal box on a highway for 40+ minutes and that&#039;s a luxury I only had living in New York. Not saying I&#039;d still want to live there. I&#039;d take hill country over the city any day, but it&#039;s a fuckload better than the hellhole of suburbia that highways create.", "time": 1673621238, "resto": 26244494}, {"no": 26255070, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)09:55:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26245162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26245162</a><br>Dude what the fuck is wrong with you.

only made 115hp and 150hp in the 16v version. In the MK4 Golf GTI with the N/A 2 litre petrol it only made 115hp. The N/A 1.8 litre 20v made 125hp. The Ford Focus Zetec with the 2 litre petrol of the same era only made 130hp as well. The Focus ST170 with the 2 litre petrol was 170, which was the same as the JDM market 323. The Clio 172 was... 172hp with a 2 litre. The Clio 182 was... 182hp with a 2 litre. But the Clio RenaultSport and ST170 were the top of the food chain hot hatches (the ST170 was touched by Cosworth). We didn&#039;t even get the 170hp version of the 323 in the UK. And normally the Japs will send us the hot shit and get frustrated when we want more power. The MG ZS was making 180 out of a 2.5 litre V6. The MG ZR with the 1.8 VVC was making 160. The Proton Satria GTi (a mates brother had one of these) which used a 1.8 4G93 was touched by Lotus and made about 140hp. <br><br>At the time manufacturers were beginning turbo to make high horse power more easily. The 1st gen Focus RS was tubro&#039;d and made 210ish hp. The 1.8T 20v from VAG made 180. The 2 litre 16v in the Fiat Coupe made 180. The 20v made 220.<br><br>TL;DR = 130hp from an N/A 2 litre at the end of the 90s / early 00s wasn&#039;t actually that bad. If you wanted more you needed the likes of Cosworth or RenaultSport to breath on your motor. Or MazdaSpeed.

So a few months ago, I asked him if he could meet me at Ruf Automobile to be re-united with his steed and do some reminiscing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It sounds like he is joking when he tells you this, but Stefan really did learn his car control craft in an old 30hp VW Beetle on ice and snow when he was 18. \u201cAs it is also rear-engined, the 911 handles very much the same only it is far more powerful,\u201d he said with a totally straight face.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI had read about such driving when I was in school in the early 1960s, and bought books on rally driving and read about the so-called Scandinavian style,\u201d he explained. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhen I got my driving licence I started to try out these techniques in deserted car parks in Stuttgart during the winter months. Of course I had to do this at night when there was nobody around or I would have been in trouble with the police.

But on snow and driven the Scandinavian way, the Beetle had even better traction than the Mini, and on snow tyres it would happily chug up hills on its mere 30hp.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stefan\u2019s next car was a much more serious driving machine, but he had only owned the BMW 1602 for three weeks before it was stolen. \u201cThis was really annoying as I had installed bucket seats and a Momo steering wheel, and I suspect that it was stolen for those parts,\u201d he said. \u201cWith 85hp to play with, I could do on dry roads what the Beetle did in the snow.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The BMW\u2019s replacement was a Porsche 914, which Stefan modified with a 200hp 2.3 litre 911 race motor fed by two big Weber carburettors with no air filters, and factory S camshafts for improved driveability and reliability.</span><br>This car also had uprated torsion bars, a limited slip differential and lightweight interior, and was as fast as the more powerful but heavier 911 Carrera RS 2.7. \u201cIt weighed under 950kg with a full fuel tank, and was a really amazing car that delivered a full-on race car feeling,\u201d said Stefan fondly reminiscing.", "time": 1673687390, "resto": 26247501}, {"no": 26258296, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26258295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26258295</a><br>3/5<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cAt this point I started my first year at the university in Esslingen studying mechanical engineering, but I clearly could not turn up in the Porsche, so I sold it and bought an Innocenti Mini Cooper, which had a 64hp 1,275cc motor.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, Stefan soon got bored of the theoretical side of his course and quit to join Auto Motor Sport magazine as a test driver. This came about through a sailing trip on Lake Konstanz with a friend who worked for AMS. \u201cMy friend had a 246GT Dino on test and I was running in convoy with my Mini,\u201d Stefan recalled. His friend in the Dino could not keep up on the twisty roads, and when they arrived, he jumped out and said, \u201cWe need you at Auto Motor Sport!\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And so Stefan changed careers overnight and never looked back. That was in 1976, and he was a senior test driver at AMS until he took early retirement for health reasons in 2009.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The car that Stefan will always be associated with is the Ruf CTR Yellow Bird. The video he made for Ruf, driving the car on the Nurburgring, is a seminal work of automotive art that later on, when the internet was invented, went viral worldwide as a must see piece of automotive folklore.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stefan picked up the story from there. \u201cI first drove the Yellow Bird in 1987,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIn the months before this I saw it being built and was sceptical because the speeds that Alois was talking about were just so far greater than any production supercar at the time, and were only possible using the tyres from the Porsche 959.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI remember the first time I drove the CTR in winter conditions,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was very cold and the autobahn was always wet. I teased the car up towards 300km/h, which was crazy if you think about it now, especially on 1980s rubber. The feeling I had was a cross between fascination and downright terror, but I was young, and it did not seem that crazy at the time.\u201d</span>", "time": 1673687451, "resto": 26247501}, {"no": 26258299, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)04:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26258296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26258296</a><br>4/5<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe idea for the Nurburgring drive actually came out of the T\u00dcV certification tests that Ruf had to complete to get the CTR approved for German road use,\u201d Stefan explained.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe CTR had to do 2,500km on the track, which gave me the chance to drive it properly under controlled conditions. The car was simply incredible and when I had completed the first lap, our development engineer, Joe Huber, who was on the stopwatch, went absolutely crazy. He could not believe how fast the car was, and I was still warming up!\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI started to really extend the car and was drifting it through the corners, but then cooled it down on the straight so as not to upset the Nurburgring staff who generally did not approve of that kind of driving on their track.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stefan explained that the idea for the video came out of that test drive, and the more dynamic and showy I could make it, the better. \u201cThis was easy as the CTR handles so well, and has more than enough power to break traction at will. It was simply a matter of being careful to manage tyre wear as smoking rubber for a complete lap of the \u2018Ring was not exactly what Dunlop had in mind.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWe also realised that not many people outside of Germany knew about the Nurburgring, so highlighting this most demanding of race tracks was just as important to our production. The combination of special car and special track is what makes this video so special.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When asked what he considers to be the best cars he has ever driven, Stefan\u2019s answer comes as a surprise.

Stefan owns not one, but two examples of an original, matching numbers 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring. The first was his father\u2019s dark blue car, bought new in 1973, and which now has 190,000 km on the clock.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second RS has done 170,000 km and was acquired as a restoration project a few years ago when the values were starting to rise but were nowhere near the stratospheric levels they are today.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIt was painted white when I got it, but was originally tangerine, and will be returned to its original hue in the course of restoration at Ruf,\u201d said Stefan. \u201cThe two cars are just 50 chassis numbers apart \u2013 1330 and 1380 \u2013 so they were probably built in the same week.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interestingly, Stefan worked for Porsche as an apprentice at Zuffenhausen and Weissach the early \u201870s, spending time on the Carrera RS 2.7 production line.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

When pulling the motor or the trans, you have to drain 7qts out of the coupling and remove the nearly 40 bolts from the flywheel.
