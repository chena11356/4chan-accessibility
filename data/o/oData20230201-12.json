I averaged 45 mpg on a couple of trips to Vegas. its great at getting up to 85-90 and sitting there in cruise control and doesn&#039;t do any gay gear shit of having awkward rpms with cruise control. id get the automatic A10 not the manual in the eco. you will hold boost through the shift with the auto so no blowoff sounds really unless you paddle shift. don&#039;t bother with those stupid blowoff valve kits, you can disconnect the egr valve line ( I think its that one, or the one next to it) to get the same sound. I would definitely get rid of the resonator but keep the stock mufflers otherwise you&#039;ll sound like shit. <br><br>also, just buy the V8. If you plan on keeping it for a while, the V8&#039;s hold value a lot better but like other anons said, you aren&#039;t getting LSD unless you get an S550. Mileage in the GT is predictably crap in town, 15-18 depending on how obnoxious I am but decent on the highway, getting anywhere from 26-30 depending on speed.", "time": 1675214444, "resto": 26314322}, {"no": 26315434, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:25:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26315407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26315407</a><br>well stock tire size, unless you&#039;re tracking it, its a waste to throw 11&#039;s on the back like some fools do. oh yeah, don&#039;t get 19&#039;s or 20&#039;s unless you plan on doing some suspension work because the ride gets a little shitty with gayfuck low profiles. they often equip them with run flat low profiles if you get 19s or 20s and the ride is just plain shit. stick with the 17s or 18s.", "time": 1675214749, "resto": 26314322}, {"no": 26315472, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:34:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26314322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26314322</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if I was to buy a Mustang I would be looking for fuel economy, reliability, serviceability, and just an overall good ownership experience.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuel economy</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in a pony car</span><br><br>You don&#039;t want a touring/performance car in general if fuel economy is a legitimate concern for you.

Further, on actual Mopar forums, legitimately nobody disrespects the V6s.

JDMs were the underdog cars you built up from cheap parts and hoped you could topple the pricier cars.<br><br>Nowadays, the market is completely fucking flipped on its head and people want a zillion dollars for an overrated, outdated, honestly slow car and you can pick up those same Corvettes, Porsches, and BMWs for like $10-$20k in good shape.<br><br>Absolutely no reason to buy 80&#039;s or 90&#039;s JDM anything anymore, all the fast ones are hella unreliable anyway, only the basic bitch econo car JDMs were ever reliable, all of the twin turbo ones are 10x as complicated as an American V8 and last maybe half as long if you&#039;re lucky while making less power and less low end torque.", "time": 1675190255, "resto": 26313635}, {"no": 26314210, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)13:43:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26313635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26313635</a><br>Nobody&#039;s going to buy that for that price.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

It goes up to make getting in easier. It goes down on the highway to reduce drag. The 3.0T is great for milage and torque. <br><br>That said the Q7 has a better build. Everything inside is nicer and it has more features and comfort standard. It\u2019s sort of annoying to go back to a Q5/A5 after an A6/Q7. <br><br>The Q7 has the Quattro ultra. It\u2019s reason d\u2019etre is efficiency. It detaches the rear axle and the drive shaft when you don\u2019t need it and saves about 5% fuel economy on the highway. A big deal? <br><br>As for performance the torsen/crown Quattros are better at speed. In snow and rain id argue that Quattro Ultra has a slight edge. It\u2019s got sensors everywhere and predicts slip and all the testing I\u2019ve seen shows it getting out of icey situations a little faster than torsen which takes a few milliseconds to detect slip before it reacts. <br><br>Some people claim ultra is just Haldex. It is not. Haldex uses a clumsy and fragile hydraulic system to squeeze the clutch. It runs 2% rear and the new ones will go 20-80 rear to front under heavy gas. It\u2019s frankly shit and fails all the time and drivers don\u2019t even notice.<br><br>The old Quattro added about .5L of usage every 60km (relative to Audis standard fwd) and the Quattro Ultra is as .2L extra thanks to lighter weight and drag. It uses an electronic system that\u2019s much more accurate and precise when applying the rear wheel so there isn\u2019t a \u2018Haldex jerk\u2019 when it engages. On top of that it\u2019s much more robust with better cooling. Haldex units overheat and die often. This system so far has been failure free (it\u2019s still new) and was developed in house by Audis awd team as a skunk works sort of operation and their pretty proud of it.<br><br>It\u2019s fwd based yes, but in my mind it\u2019s better for weather in that it corrects for snow or ice before torsen and years before Haldex or x drive type systems. <br>Q7 better for car seats in a big way btw.
