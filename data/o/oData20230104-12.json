moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA. During the BPR years Ratel would form the SRO which has been shaping GT racing for almost 30 years.", "time": 1671993842, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195774, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190601</a><br><a href=\"#p26190626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190626</a><br>I never get why europoor teams get so butthurt by large displacement engines in racing. like if your angry about murricans making 12L v8s and winning, maybe use larger engines your self instead of running on 1L v6s in your cars and expecting everyone else to do the same", "time": 1672002141, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_4518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672005636401813, "time": 1672005636, "md5": "gew40DwLhFVqlT44++al1Q==", "fsize": 192286, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26196163, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)19:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26195529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26195529</a><br>The Short-Tail F1 GTRs were nerfed throughout the 1996 season, to the point that they were heavier than the Road Car versions and only making about 400-ish Horsepower at best.

flinging shit at each other without actually knowing whose shit it is. <br><br>The GTS/R originally raced as a GT1 car when it debuted in 1996. Back then the main deciding factor of which category a car belonged was based on engine displacement. The Viper being 8.0L was firmly designated for GT1. When the FIA revised their rules for 1997 (mainly to allow for more exotic cars and technology like the CLK GTR), Chrysler had the GTS/R rehomologated for FIA&#039;s GT2. For the US races, they would race under the SCCA&#039;s GT2 category for USRRC races and IMSA/ACO&#039;s GTS category for ALMS. When USRRC gave way to Grand-Am, the GTS/R was in the GTO category until they renamed it GTS (many of the same cars as ACO, but under GARRA&#039;s rules) until Vipers were no longer running in the series. These different categories in different series were basically analogous to FIA&#039;s pre-&#039;97 regs.<br><br>When ACO adopted the FIA&#039;s newly revised GT regs essentially adapting the old GTS and GT classes as new GT1 and GT2, the GTS/R was categorized as a GT1 under the new rules.

The only reason why Porsche got into GT1 in the first place was because their 1995 prototype project fell through and ACO banned them from racing a 962 in a GT category after &#039;94. Instead of complying with the rules of not entering a prototype in a GT class, they would build a new prototype and have the rules changed later and so they came out with the 911 GT1 for &#039;96. They&#039;d win some races in BPR, but because it wasn&#039;t homologated at the time, it didn&#039;t count for any championship points. When the FIA took over BPR and updated the rules, irony Porsche as it was getting beaten at their own game by the new Mercedes and updated McLaren. For most of the program, the car was getting its butt-kicked in FIA GT and could only muster a few non-championship exhibition races. Their only consolation prize was a championship in the national-level BGTC. <br><br>It was in 1998 that they went go-for-broke in the final year of the program and completely revised the car. They still got their ass handed to them in FIA GT (and lost their BGTC crown to a McLaren team), but they did end up winning Le Mans. However to do it, Porsche had to buyout the LMP team that had been beating them over the last two years and &quot;upgrade&quot; their cars. Both would DNF leaving the GT1 cars the sole factory-supported team. The biggest irony was that the LMP car that kept beating them before was the using Porsche&#039;s abandoned prototype project from before. <br><br>The final black eye of the program was at the final race of the factory program at the very first Petite Le Mans where they DNF&#039;d by managing to get the car airborne and flip over end-over-end. <br><br>A stupid end to a stupid car.", "filename": "1669560429878247", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1672672048777314, "time": 1672672048, "md5": "4yCy9dH67rdyoFiF52neIw==", "fsize": 728194, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26217565, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)10:19:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216736</a><br>Based Sintura.

BUT the compass &quot;trailhawk&quot; was the biggest peice of shit. The brand new engine burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which I only found out because one day driving down the highway my engine shuts off at 60 mph after a &quot;low oil pressure&quot; warning flashed up for 5 seconds. This happened the first time aound 10k miles. And several times after that despite me pouring a fresh quart in once a month. I was then told that the oil consumption rate was normal by the dealership. Aside from that I had shit break on it constantly. Half the parts are from a fiat 500 and it&#039;s 4wd is actually just AWD. The final nail in the coffin was when my battery died, but it wasn&#039;t actually my battery. It was a very small sub battery that sat on top of my normal battery that INDEPENDENTLY powered the starter motor. So I had a totally fine battery, but because some AA Duracell shit was dead the fucking car wouldn&#039;t start.

You can use these tools to help you manage your time more effectively and reduce the amount of time you spend on your phone.<br><br>Take breaks from your phone: Try to schedule regular breaks from your phone throughout the day. During these breaks, put your phone away and engage in other activities, such as reading a book, going for a walk, or spending time with friends and family.<br><br>Find alternative ways to stay connected: Instead of relying on your phone to stay connected with others, try using other forms of communication, such as phone calls, text messages, or in-person conversations.<br><br>Turn off notifications: Many people feel the need to constantly check their phones because they are alerted to new notifications. Consider turning off non-essential notifications or setting your phone to &quot;do not disturb&quot; mode when you want to focus on other tasks.<br><br>Keep your phone out of reach: If you find it difficult to resist the urge to check your phone, try keeping it out of reach when you are not using it.

However, it&#039;s important to note that living in a city can also have its challenges, such as higher cost of living, noise and air pollution, and a lack of green space.

And man does it have more to give. First I&#039;m gonna say one of the biggest improvements aside from the obvious was launch stability. The rear end stayed flat and it felt like both tires had even grip even under a hard launch which is impressive considering the whole open diff thing and the rear sway bar probably does something to help with axle wrap. Now for the obvious, around the corners it stayed perfectly flat with almost no understeer and the throttle input to induce oversteer was far more predictable and importantly consistent allowing me to kick out the rear end counter steer and get the car going the right way. The abundance of right hand turns made this easy to test and get a hang of. My only complaint is the car seems to rock now which kinda sucks going from my glorified boat suspension but the performance gain and the tire wear aspect of not leaning onto the outside shoulders of the tires should make the bullshit all completely worth it. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mfw I hit this right turn at 40 with the most graceful power slide before flooring it away and hitting redline</span>", "filename": "download (1) (7)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 234, "h": 215, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672654164285373, "time": 1672654164, "md5": "FQUnNHhvS60jj1efMrDuwA==", "fsize": 6467, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217133, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212426</a><br>Don&#039;t get a fucking teeter totter one like that bro!", "time": 1672655143, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217408, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)08:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217110</a><br>Noice, it\u2019s always a good feeling when you install mods that actually have a noticeable effect.", "time": 1672667688, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217421, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:06:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216487</a><br>New mustangs are double that.<br>1 less degree of engine tilt equals about 1 and a half degrees of u-joint angle (averaging based on generic suspension height/drivetrain positioning).<br><br>Stupid question...<br>Was the original shaft a 2 piece with slip joint?", "time": 1672668361, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217437, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217421</a><br>3 piece with a matching pocket square", "time": 1672668677, "resto": 26209882}, {"no": 26217482, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26217437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26217437</a><br>Look into a late model ranger driveshaft.

They have something that translates to &#039;&#039;Luxury Tax&#039;&#039; (literal translation) which states that, any car with an engine equal or bigger than 1.8L of displacement, is considered a luxury and will be heavily taxed. My 4.6L V8 for example would cost me around 4000$ a year in said Tax alone, and we didn&#039;t even touch the Co2 tax yet. Not only that, the Tolls that they pay on their roads are also astronomical. From Thessaloniki to Athens (around 300 miles) you will pay close to 70$ in Tolls. Greece also has a VaT of 24% which is much much higher than, say, Germany for example. Getting to the point, can you guess if Greece has good road infrastructure or not? It&#039;s a rhetorical question, greece has abysmal roads. Greece also, always, has the highest gas prices out of any EU country, because of Taxes.<br>in short, German drivers pay less than 1/3rd for their car than anyone in Greece does, and yet they have ridiculously better roads than greece, why? Greek politicians just eat up the money that&#039;s supposed to go to road infrastructure. Simple as. It happens of course in germany too but to a much much smaller degree.

The power company already has to mandate a device that can remotely disconnect my central air conditioner to shed load if there is a threat of blackouts, so they could do that with my EV charger too if I had one, problem is that at the rate the grid is increasing its capacity they&#039;d pretty much have to fuck a majority of EV users who are charging during the day to keep blackouts from happening and the nightly drops in demand we experience now would basically cease to exist, if EV adoption were to reach the rate desired by policymakers. This is a huge problem, because the other green energy sources; wind and solar, produce basically nothing at night, so all of the load has to fall on other sources. The convenient thing for our crop of authoritarian politicians is that it&#039;s easy to manufacture a crisis this way and limit people&#039;s mobility using EV adoption. You can restrict when they can charge, you can restrict through the smart grid who (geographically, personally?) can charge, and decreasing demand for gasoline will force refineries to shut down, raising the prices of fuel since it will complicate logistics and reduce economy of scale.

There&#039;s a reason why your rent or mortgage went up, why food went up, and why gas keeps going up. It&#039;s because capitalism requires endless profit seeking and constant growth. It&#039;s the ideology of cancer, and we&#039;re paying for it.<br>And I mean many people on 4chan are just gonna blame the jews or whatever because you also know this, but you&#039;ve been steeped in anticommunist rhetoric given to you by the letterbois, churches, and corporations", "filename": "Jewish Conspiracy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 363, "h": 380, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672669642134287, "time": 1672669642, "md5": "nDK8adYcvpHQd6jAXWwZZQ==", "fsize": 39305, "resto": 26214354}, {"no": 26218338, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)14:47:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26214786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26214786</a><br>Saudis are already getting paid in Yuan by China and Russians are getting paid in Rupees by India.<br>The petro-dollar is already dying.", "time": 1672688878, "resto": 26214354}, {"no": 26218392, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:04:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26215488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26215488</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Europe [...] is in fact in the process of building new nuclear power plants.</span><br>no they fucking are not<br>give some sauce for your absurd claims<br>Germany has shut down all of it&#039;s nuclear power plants (20 -&gt;1 or 0)<br>Belgium keep extending the life of the nuclear power plants that were built in the 70s and were supposed to be retired in the early 2000s.

On the other hand, installing tons of renewable energy is intrinsically good (putting aside the transmission and land-use debates for a second, but we can return to those later) outside of reliability impacts, which are mostly due to grid congestion and/or non-firmed (variability between how much the PV could put out in an hour and how much it does/did) generation. The solution of course is batteries/some other kind of energy storage, and whoa hey would you look at that, it JUST SO HAPPENS that EVs are about 40% batter by weight and with good enough tech (V[ehicle]2G[rid]) we can actually use this to our advantage because with controllable charging/discharging from what is in aggregate a huge fucking battery, the increased demand and load profile issues suddenly aren&#039;t such a huge problem anymore.<br><br><a href=\"#p26221208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26221208</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not the Russian bot, y-you are!</span><br><br>I think you&#039;d do well to remember that we&#039;ve been subsidizing the fossil fuel industry for over 40 years up until now.
