From racing games to adventure and fighting games and everything inbetween, region-locking was common because markets were very self-enclosed back then, the internet was extremely young and what an European market found alluring wasn&#039;t what an Australian market would find that way, there was not enough power of an unified group of people to make a single international market for a game like nowadays, so you either attracted individual markets for unified revenue or you just marketed your game to the local market without risking a failed export attempt.<br>The same idea was perfectly true with cars, movies, music, etc.", "filename": "maxresdefault (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672514440386651, "time": 1672514440, "md5": "bP4A2oTIXcozPLyhrGUBqA==", "fsize": 172139, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212372, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)14:23:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212365</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...in BlackBox&#039;s NFS titles like Most Wanted*</span>", "time": 1672514583, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212403, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)14:35:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212365</a><br>that&#039;s a lot of words too bad I&#039;m not reading em<br>regional content is peak sovl sorry to hear you&#039;re infected with globohomo cancer and can&#039;t stand different people having different experiences than you", "time": 1672515325, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212563, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)15:48:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Played RBR in 2006, installed the rsf version today, are there any updates to the physics engine itself or just tweaked parameters?", "filename": "xsara", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 259, "h": 194, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672519728129747, "time": 1672519728, "md5": "VEI/fKkKOxSzDof4x25L8g==", "fsize": 8210, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212688, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;assetto corsa = the skyrim of car games</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dirt rally = dark souls</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gran turismo = half life 2</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forza horizon = call of duty</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rbr = STALKER</span>", "time": 1672521928, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212762, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:45:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212688</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gpl = doom</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cmr2 = blood</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gtr = Unreal Tournament</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;race 07 = max payne</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rally trophy = quake 3 arena</span>", "time": 1672523121, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212777, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:48:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212688</a><br>ac is definitely oblivion/skyrim because the mods look so fun and then you go and play it if it even works and it&#039;s like ew gross<br>dirt rally is street fighter 4<br>gran turismo is borderlands<br>fortza motorsport is cod<br>horizon is cod zombies<br>nfs is currently literally battlefield<br>papyrus&#039; nascar racing is quake<br>iracing is what counterstrike wishes it could be<br>mario kart is unreal tournament<br>whiplash is goldeneye", "time": 1672523323, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212782, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26211580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26211580</a><br>just steal it", "time": 1672523413, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212783, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:50:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "HOMM3, Diablo 2, CS 1.6 of car games?", "time": 1672523437, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212799, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:55:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212783</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cs 1.6</span><br>LFS", "time": 1672523731, "resto": 26207332}, {"no": 26212810, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)17:00:43", "name": "Panda5", "com": "<a href=\"#p26212365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26212365</a><br>EA was already a pretty big name by the mid-90s.

the paddle shifters are attached to the wheel hub it is very easy to get crossed up and mis-shift.<br>for me the ability to use an h-shifter to drop down multiple gears and be able to accurately shift up in the middle of a drift is key to good drifting. you can do it with paddles it is just much much harder, and you really and truly need a clutch pedal or at least a way to open and drop the clutch to actually be able to control the car mid-drift at all.<br><br>if i may recommend set your steering lock to 540, this prevents you from getting the steering crossed up and will alleviate some of the issues with the paddles. you should be able to go full lock to lock without removing both hands from the wheel. at each end of lock your wrists should basically be touching. then in car setup adjust the front toe to something like -0.30, -0.40, or even less, this is ideal retard drift mode and will let you do very cool drifts without a lot of effort", "time": 1672624431, "resto": 26207332},

also slow you down with kills the momentum and stops the drift.<br>the clutch allows you to cut all torque to the wheels and immediately drop it back on again. the handbrake allows you the additional step of jamming those wheels into a full stop, with causes them to slide like casters, and then you use the normal brakes of the car to -- once the sideways drift has started -- rotate the body about the front wheels which should be in a state of understeer that pulls the car into an arc. you then drop the spinning engine back onto the rear wheels via the clutch once the vehicle is pointed in the direction you want to go, which, provided the alignment is good, should thrust you forward and around the corner like a rocket achieving orbit.<br>without a way to cut the engines momentum off the wheels you cannot rotate the car sideways whilst still moving in a straight line.<br><br>the handbrake is primarily used to aid rotation in small spaces and sharp corners where flicking the car

They have something that translates to &#039;&#039;Luxury Tax&#039;&#039; (literal translation) which states that, any car with an engine equal or bigger than 1.8L of displacement, is considered a luxury and will be heavily taxed. My 4.6L V8 for example would cost me around 4000$ a year in said Tax alone, and we didn&#039;t even touch the Co2 tax yet. Not only that, the Tolls that they pay on their roads are also astronomical. From Thessaloniki to Athens (around 300 miles) you will pay close to 70$ in Tolls. Greece also has a VaT of 24% which is much much higher than, say, Germany for example. Getting to the point, can you guess if Greece has good road infrastructure or not? It&#039;s a rhetorical question, greece has abysmal roads. Greece also, always, has the highest gas prices out of any EU country, because of Taxes.<br>in short, German drivers pay less than 1/3rd for their car than anyone in Greece does, and yet they have ridiculously better roads than greece, why? Greek politicians just eat up the money that&#039;s supposed to go to road infrastructure. Simple as. It happens of course in germany too but to a much much smaller degree.

The power company already has to mandate a device that can remotely disconnect my central air conditioner to shed load if there is a threat of blackouts, so they could do that with my EV charger too if I had one, problem is that at the rate the grid is increasing its capacity they&#039;d pretty much have to fuck a majority of EV users who are charging during the day to keep blackouts from happening and the nightly drops in demand we experience now would basically cease to exist, if EV adoption were to reach the rate desired by policymakers. This is a huge problem, because the other green energy sources; wind and solar, produce basically nothing at night, so all of the load has to fall on other sources. The convenient thing for our crop of authoritarian politicians is that it&#039;s easy to manufacture a crisis this way and limit people&#039;s mobility using EV adoption. You can restrict when they can charge, you can restrict through the smart grid who (geographically, personally?) can charge, and decreasing demand for gasoline will force refineries to shut down, raising the prices of fuel since it will complicate logistics and reduce economy of scale.

The brand new engine burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which I only found out because one day driving down the highway my engine shuts off at 60 mph after a &quot;low oil pressure&quot; warning flashed up for 5 seconds. This happened the first time aound 10k miles. And several times after that despite me pouring a fresh quart in once a month. I was then told that the oil consumption rate was normal by the dealership. Aside from that I had shit break on it constantly. Half the parts are from a fiat 500 and it&#039;s 4wd is actually just AWD. The final nail in the coffin was when my battery died, but it wasn&#039;t actually my battery. It was a very small sub battery that sat on top of my normal battery that INDEPENDENTLY powered the starter motor. So I had a totally fine battery, but because some AA Duracell shit was dead the fucking car wouldn&#039;t start.

And man does it have more to give. First I&#039;m gonna say one of the biggest improvements aside from the obvious was launch stability. The rear end stayed flat and it felt like both tires had even grip even under a hard launch which is impressive considering the whole open diff thing and the rear sway bar probably does something to help with axle wrap. Now for the obvious, around the corners it stayed perfectly flat with almost no understeer and the throttle input to induce oversteer was far more predictable and importantly consistent allowing me to kick out the rear end counter steer and get the car going the right way.

With properly tuned motor and transmission you can floor it, spool boost, and keep up with modern econoboxes and usually pass traffic.

But for people who like forevercars, that&#039;s a reasonable cost, and they run the cars very cheaply once paid off since most normies spend several hundreds of thousands, approaching over a million rotating through new cars/trucks every few years.", "time": 1672626113, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216558, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26202075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26202075</a><br>2002*", "time": 1672633009, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216979, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:29:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26202058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26202058</a><br>I&#039;ll take the fucking plastic jfc", "filename": "Josh TSX", "ext": ".png", "w": 1791, "h": 867, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1672648163440260, "time": 1672648163, "md5": "85crn4lhDssJwXIZtOH84Q==", "fsize": 94382, "resto": 26202040}, {"no": 26216988, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)03:39:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "isn&#039;t it a funny coincidence that whenever volkswagen wants to make a car, it&#039;s always a piece of shit?<br>literally every good car to come from them, apart from maybe the golf, actually came from somebody outside of volkswagen", "filename": "bugatti-veyron-super-sport-", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 770, "h": 523, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1672648751332169, "time": 1672648751, "md5": "JuKmeUt1MxjWlR8J/+tSsA==", "fsize": 261429, "resto": 26202040}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26215593, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)16:51:17", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "why y&#039;all fucking lying about RWD and Winter?", "com": "Suffered for the last month due to snow storms and fuck y&#039;all fuckers for lying.

I&#039;ve worked in the EV industry, specifically LEV&#039;s, and the batteries are just garbage. They don&#039;t hold a charge worth a shit, they die after a few years, they&#039;re incredibly expensive, and if you touch them wrong they explode. No thanks! I did an internship with a guy whose whole thing is he just forces EV batteries to explode under different conditions (he had this whole armored trailer filled with cameras and shit, it was wild) and after watching enough of those videos I decided I was never, ever going to charge an EV battery inside of a habitable structure again. They&#039;re literally incomplete bombs, waiting for something to disturb their structure just enough to go off. Terrifying. However, the practical advantages of electric motors are pretty profound when you really think about it - the instant torque, low maintenance, less points of failure etc as you mentioned are really an incredibly engineering leap. I used to tell people &quot;Think about how long a ceiling fan lasts. They basically never break, right? It&#039;s like that.&quot; and it is. My fantasy future vehicle though is a diesel-electric drive where a diesel generator charges a battery pack which drives electric motors. All of the advantages of ICE and all the advantages of electric motors. They probably wouldn&#039;t even cost that much more than current designs once we figure out the right mix, since it&#039;s all proven technology that already exists at the size and scale we&#039;d need.

moron talking out of his ass and doesn&#039;t understand that technical regulations don&#039;t stay static for decades. Rules change and cars can be eligible for different categories. The McLaren F1 didn&#039;t race under the same GT1 regs in 1997 as it did in the years prior. The Toyota GT-One was recategorized as a GTP when GT1 was cancelled. The Viper GTS/R raced as a GT1 in its first year, then rehomologated as a GT2. It&#039;d also race under the IMSA/ACO rules in the GTS category. Then you had the Maserti MC-12 which didn&#039;t conform to re-vamped GT1 regs of mid-&#039;00s, but was granted homologation on a waiver anyway because Mosley demanded it. <br><br>The main takeaway is that rules change and different racing series can categorize cars as they see fit. GT1 in 1994 was not the same as GT1 in 2005 or GTS in 2001 or GT in 2003.

Under these circumstances, Venturi made their own one-make series in 1992 called the Gentleman Driver&#039;s Trophy for amateurs which garnered a lot of attention despite being side-events for bigger races. The series used their 400 Trophy racecar and got a lot of response from teams. In charge of the series was Venturi&#039;s head of competition services, Stephane Ratel, who is practically the godfather of the modern GT era. In 1993, facing a dwindling prototype field, the ACO allowed production-based cars to fill the rest of the grid for the first time since 1986. The response to their Trophy series and a chance for competing at the LM24, Venturi stepped up to the plate with the 500LM and were represented by no less than 7 cars. They didn&#039;t win, but most of the cars actually succeeded in finishing the race. <br><br>In 1994, Ratel teamed up with Jurgen Barth and Patrick Peter to make the BPR series which would aim to become the first intercontinental sportscar series since Gr.C folded. Ratel would apply his connections from the Trophy series to get teams to race in BPR giving Venturi a strong presence in a field that would otherwise be a slew of 911s and a single F40 for most of the races. The BPR would continue to grow in 1995 and 1996 with Venturi competing every year until it was taken over by the FIA. During the BPR years Ratel would form the SRO which has been shaping GT racing for almost 30 years.", "time": 1671993842, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195774, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)16:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26190601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190601</a><br><a href=\"#p26190626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26190626</a><br>I never get why europoor teams get so butthurt by large displacement engines in racing. like if your angry about murricans making 12L v8s and winning, maybe use larger engines your self instead of running on 1L v6s in your cars and expecting everyone else to do the same", "time": 1672002141, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26195887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)17:00:36", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_4518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672005636401813, "time": 1672005636, "md5": "gew40DwLhFVqlT44++al1Q==", "fsize": 192286, "resto": 26190494}, {"no": 26196163, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)19:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26195529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26195529</a><br>The Short-Tail F1 GTRs were nerfed throughout the 1996 season, to the point that they were heavier than the Road Car versions and only making about 400-ish Horsepower at best.

flinging shit at each other without actually knowing whose shit it is. <br><br>The GTS/R originally raced as a GT1 car when it debuted in 1996. Back then the main deciding factor of which category a car belonged was based on engine displacement. The Viper being 8.0L was firmly designated for GT1. When the FIA revised their rules for 1997 (mainly to allow for more exotic cars and technology like the CLK GTR), Chrysler had the GTS/R rehomologated for FIA&#039;s GT2. For the US races, they would race under the SCCA&#039;s GT2 category for USRRC races and IMSA/ACO&#039;s GTS category for ALMS. When USRRC gave way to Grand-Am, the GTS/R was in the GTO category until they renamed it GTS (many of the same cars as ACO, but under GARRA&#039;s rules) until Vipers were no longer running in the series. These different categories in different series were basically analogous to FIA&#039;s pre-&#039;97 regs.<br><br>When ACO adopted the FIA&#039;s newly revised GT regs essentially adapting the old GTS and GT classes as new GT1 and GT2, the GTS/R was categorized as a GT1 under the new rules.

And on to of that the C pillars are much wider for the same reason which also doesn&#039;t look good. Many cars for example Camrys have black plastic on the C pillar to make it look like it&#039;s part of the window. once you notice its embarrassing and really really cheapens the car. makes it look like a toy. there are other things. but yea those are the main ones i guess.", "time": 1672623744, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216281, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:12:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Trends, but also safety", "filename": "2023_cadillac_escalade_4dr-suv_premium-luxury_fq_oem_1_1600[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 1067, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672625544999682, "time": 1672625544, "md5": "YGOEAbaIFajpJpnAHbdpmg==", "fsize": 199083, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216451, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:31:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mud flaps in front of the front wheels</span>", "time": 1672630273, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216473, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26216451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26216451</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t do hektik reverse pulls on gravel</span>", "filename": "11235607166_2aa746ef78_b[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672630980086221, "time": 1672630980, "md5": "uTs8noPSXCcTzZVAf0CgDA==", "fsize": 227065, "resto": 26215422}, {"no": 26216652, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)23:52:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26215422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26215422</a><br>half of car buyers are women, another third are niggers, the rest are men with micropenis.

The security systems of EV&#039;s draw the power from the 12v circuit. <br>The other problem is wire and circuit management. A bunch of wires together can still radiate power between each other like electromagnetic fields, and higher voltage systems can destabilize fixed electro radiation frequencies of lower voltage direct current systems. The problem is the EV car have two direct current circuits with near the same amp loads for their voltages. Overloading amps is the same as sparking wires, and those sparking wires are melted solder after they are done. If there is no safety fuse or controller to cut off that, then the amp overload will cycle though the battery and then boom. The problem about that safety shutoff is your car and it&#039;s by wire system will no longer operable. <br>The problem is EV&#039;s have two voltage systems on the platform, so the cause is most likely electromagnetic radiation form the higher voltage getting into the lower voltage wires. The wires from both circuits are most likely not the same gauge to handle the same Watts. There is no need for a low voltage wire near a high voltage motor, or battery.<br><br>Short answer is the electrical circuits in EV&#039;s are shit and that&#039;s the only reason they spontaneously combust.
