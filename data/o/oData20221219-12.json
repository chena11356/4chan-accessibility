Unless that is your situation, you shouldn&#039;t but a car like this because it is going to break down on you. It 100% needs repairs that will be very expensive if you pay a mechanic. In 3 years I&#039;ve only taken my e36 to a mechanic 3 times because I do most of the work myself. I was not able to do 3 jobs in my garage. 1, replacing the rear lower control arms. 2 replacing the lock system module after it locked the doors shut, 3 reattaching the exhaust manifold after I did a full engine rebuild. For these jobs you need special tools and or a proper lift. To reattach the exhaust, they had to lift the car and then drop the engine down. There is no other way to access the studs. And that doesn&#039;t get into the dozens of jobs I did myself. Brakes, coolant system rebuild, entire cylinder head rebuild and timing, new clutch master and slave cylinder, new tie rods etc etc. I&#039;m not saying these repairs are a big deal, but a car that old will need them and will be expensive unless you can do them yourself. Tbh the parts themselves are not crazy expensive but labor tends to make shitty so expensive.<br><br>Actually a few weeks ago my coworker told me it cost him 700 dollars to replace one control arm and 6 spark plugs and coil packs on his Lexus. I looked up the parts on rock auto, even if he went with top end parts, it was under 200 for everything, but you add labor, 120 bucks an hour and honestly he&#039;s lucky it was as cheap as it was.

Hybrid Electric Vehicles, especially Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicles are Electric Vehicles. Nobody gets caught up on the &#039;purity&#039; of the powertrain, especially when talking about powertrain development to conform to the reality of racing rulebooks which allow hydrogen refueling but not battery swapping. One of the advantages of electric powertrains is their ability to take advantage of multiple sources of electricity, and an endurance racing EV using a swappable high capacity battery would still have a similar design with a buffer battery for peak performance, and the KERS.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will last for less than half an hour at the average power consumption of 120 kW (that&#039;s 160 horsepower), leaving you with fuel-cell&#039;s 85 kW (114 hp)</span><br>Except that&#039;s not how it works. The 85kW fuel cell is continually generating electricity, so any time the car is drawing more power than that the fuel cell can provide its drawing on the power stored in the buffer battery, and any time the car is drawing less power than that, the fuel cell is filling the buffer battery back up. Also any time the car is decelerating its using the KERS to put energy back into the buffer battery.<br>As I said, this is very similar to how endurance racing performance hybrids work, and why they&#039;re so dominant because the battery acts as a buffer to keep the generator in a lower stress state.<br><br>Considering how much higher performance the N Vision 74&#039;s motors are, and how much better the Kinetic Energy Recovery they can provide is compared to the Prius, it would still almost certainly be able to outpace it.

Incredibly simple, yet it works on multiple levels.<br>For one it tests if you have a concept of delayed reward. Reverse parking is slightly more difficult and time consuming than forward parking for a novice. Yet when you come to leave, driving forwards out of a space onto a busy street or parking lot is infinitely easier than backing out and being unable to see what&#039;s coming. The payoff is well worth it.<br>But that&#039;s not all<br>Reverse parking is easier than forward once you practice, but more difficult initially. So it is also a laziness test. Someone who gives no shits about what is better in the long run or improving themselves will always choose the lazy option of badly forward parking because it is &quot;easier and quicker&quot;, and they will spend their entire life doing that.<br>For those that aren&#039;t filtered by the laziness and intelligence test it actually works out even better once you practice due to the way cars turn. While going forwards the rear end follows the front and cuts the corner trailing behind you. You have little control over this. So to forward park properly, you have to swing the front out wide (which you don&#039;t always have room for) so that the rear end can cut the corner and end up in the right place. Most forward parkers are too stupid to realise this, so they end up backing out and in again multiple times or they just leave the car at a stupid angle they initially pulled in at.<br>On the contrary, while going backwards your car becomes rear steering. By thinking ahead you can make very tight turns and still end up placing the rear of the car exactly where it needs to be then correcting the placement of the front of the car in the same motion<br><br>Tl;dr being able to rear-park is a retard test", "time": 1671364524, "resto": 26174170}, {"no": 26176243, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There are a few reasons why backing into a parking space may be considered better than driving into a parking space head-on:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Improved visibility: </span><br>When you reverse park, you have a better view of your surroundings because you are facing the opposite direction.

You know how in movies most of the important characters are attractive? Good-looking people exist in real life too, but you&#039;re unlikely to find such a concentration of beautiful people in real life as you do in Hollywood movies. It&#039;s kind of like that with the cars in those movies. Yes, you could see cars on the street like the ones in the movies, but it would be unusual to see so many that take it quite so far as the ones in the movies. For what it&#039;s worth, I consider that style to be more of a 90&#039;s thing than an early 00&#039;s thing, by the way. By the early 00&#039;s, it was already on the way out, and the dotcom crash / small recession around 2002 killed it in the US, imo. For a positive portrayal of that scene, visit your local library and see if they have old copies of Sports Compact Car magazine from the late 90&#039;s.

If it&#039;s low miles or otherwise &quot;preserved&quot;, flip it to a boomer and go buy a driver one and pocket the difference. They&#039;re very fun cars and definitely one of the worst to lock up in a garage as a pseudo art piece in this clown market where they sell for double what they&#039;re worth.<br>Assuming it&#039;s not a museum specimen, start modding it. This is your life now. I recommend at least a catback and probably headers. Not sure about the NA2s (assuming yours is one and not a facelifted 95-01), but the 3.0 cars are very quiet from factory and slow anyway, so you might as well wake it up and enjoy one of the better-sounding V6s. If you have the cash for a supercharger kit and can find one, I hear the extra few horses make the car not-slow. Turbos make them actually fast, but good luck finding kits for reasonable money.<br>Also: you should either start hoarding parts or praying for a recession, because everything&#039;s ricetaxed through the roof on these, even stock stuff.

So far I&#039;ve replaced the shifter shaft bushings, shifter shaft clamps (the good ole boy I bought it from replaced on of the clamps with an ill-fitting strip of 20GA at some point so that cleaned up the shifter slop considerably), replaced the shifter and retaining pin along with adding a damper to further cut down on slop, blue Loctite&#039;d all the fasteners in the shifter mechanism and torqued to spec, and I&#039;ve checked the PRNDL mechanism to make sure it is functioning correctly. All of this has improved the feel of the shifter considerably, but no dice on the incorrect indicator and squeaky noise. Through process of elimination I am now convinced that the shift cable needs to be adjusted or replaced. I can watch the mechanism move from the floor and there is no slop. The noise seems to come from close to the firewall where the cable is. Like it is binding up or something.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heater</span><br>I have no heat. I replaced the thermostat and in doing so realized the coolant system badly needs flushed. There&#039;s no air in the system so far as I can tell. The vents are blowing cold air so I narrowed the problem down to either a faulty blend knob, blend door actuator, or blend door. Today I removed the blend actuator to test functionality and further narrow down the problem. It functioned when turning the knob so the knob and actuator both work. Around the key that the actuator turns there is black plastic debris which I believe indicates a broken blend door. Tomorrow I am going to be cutting through the dash and plenum behind the glovebox and replacing the door. My hope is that between a coolant system flush, a heater core backflush, a new blend door actuator, and a new blend door heat to the cab can be restored.", "time": 1670472295, "resto": 26129723}, {"no": 26146386, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)23:13:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26146346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26146346</a><br>This has to be a troll.

But I managed to remove the old throttle cables with a combination of ring spanners, poking utensils and what girls refer to as &#039;magic hands&#039;. My original plan to just replace the internal cable was foiled by the damaged English (oxford) and their refusal to include any of the cable ends that LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE JAPANESE BIKE USES in their &quot;universal throttle cable kit&quot;. Luckily I&#039;m God&#039;s favourite NPC so the go to bike bits shop had two (almost) universal throttle cable kits that ( were Japanese and) they sold for the price of one because I was wearing overalls and told them I ride a tiny Honda. I say &#039;almost universal because while my throttle housing had one M8\u00d71.25 thread that fitted perfectly the throttle return is a M10\u00d7 1.25 thread, I figured out I could just drill and tap the end of the old cable. However the only way to buy a M10\u00d71.25 tap on a Sunday is as part of a 40 piece tap and die set at any given hardware store.<br>But after all of this and some more &#039;Magic hands&#039; I have a fully functioning bike with zero throttle slack.

The 12V stubby is like a replacement for a 1/2\u201d ratchet, it\u2019s not going to do anything you can\u2019t do by hand. There\u2019s a huge difference in power if you get down on some of the mid torque 18V 1/2\u201d guns and they\u2019re only a couple inches long. Plus a compact 18V isn\u2019t much larger than the 12V tools and you can use the $100 batteries on tons of other useful tools.<br><br>Also as far as stubby impacts, they\u2019re not that powerful overall, and 90% of the jobs you would grab the stubby for, you could use a 1/4\u201d impact driver with a socket adapter and get the same results. So if you\u2019re just buying into a cordless platform, skip the 12V stubby and check out something like the DeWalt 20V Atomic drill and impact driver kit, they\u2019re real affordable when they go on sale. Then save up and get DeWalt\u2019s newest 20V XR 1/2\u201d mid torque, it\u2019s a beast for the size and you won\u2019t even need a high torque for all but the most stubborn rusted shit. But make sure it\u2019s the newest one because the gen 1 XR mid torque is far less powerful and looks the same.<br><br>If you\u2019re a burger, Makita is like #3 of the cordless tool brands as far as reasons to buy. Milwaukee and DeWalt trade places for 1 and 2. Milwaukee is a step ahead on /o/ focused tools, but DeWalt has better sales, plus they just released a ton of new stuff in the past year so Milwaukee better drop some new shit or they will lose that #1 spot. Makita is more expensive like DeWalt and doesn\u2019t have nearly as many /o/ focused tools.<br><br>Bosch is just dumb if you\u2019re a burger because it\u2019s like Makita but worse. Kobalt and Ridgid will give you DeWalt quality tools at a good price but they don\u2019t have a huge selection of tools.

Besides if we want to compleain about anything for this gen the si had bad snchros stock and the reorientation of the engine makes it a bitch to work on also power steering fluid in everything in the 2000s were shit. <br>Tbf my current fc4 is more of a pain in the ass in ac failure. On second evap core and 3rd condenser. Paint chips worse than any civic I&#039;ve owned and is fading harder than the 9th gen I had that got paint recalled.

If you make 100k and like to save, the convenience of buying something newer can easily make sense.

The flywheels gain energy from the use of the front brakes then discharges that energy back to the front wheels via a driveshaft running over the top of the combustion engine. The flywheels can also output power to a secondary driveshaft which is connected to a limited-slip differential at the rear of the car which feeds epicyclic gearboxes located in each rear wheel hub, allowing the GT-R to be all-wheel drive if necessary.\u201d<br><br>Sound complicated? It should, because it is.<br><br>Additionally, while the engine is in front of the driver, it\u2019s also behind the centerline of the front wheels, so it\u2019s more of a front-mid layout. As Bowlby explained in an interview with Racecar Engineering:<br><br> \u201cThe front tyres on the Nissan GT-R LM NISMO are bigger than the rear tyres \u2013 14 inch wide front vs. 9 inch rear. This is due to the way that mass is distributed in the car. We have moved the weight bias forwards to give us traction for the front-engined, front-wheel drive. We\u2019ve also moved the aero forwards so we\u2019ve moved the capacity of the tyres forward to match the weight distribution. So the aero centre of pressure, the mass centre of gravity and the tyre capacity are all in harmony and that means we have bigger tyres at the front than the rear\u201d", "time": 1668401797, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26077064, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)00:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070728</a><br>He said power pendejo the srt4 was slow as fuck and so was the gt", "time": 1668402085, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26078886, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:58:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076495</a><br>Nice", "time": 1668463081, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079900, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26076861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26076861</a><br>This", "time": 1668491283, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26079982, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26070415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26070415</a><br>Every single manufacturer ever", "time": 1668493700, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080005, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Not coming up with the idea to put their biggest engine<br>Dual cam swap it<br>Bore it out a little more<br>And shove it in the smallest and lightest car in their portfolio<br><br>The actual fuckup was buying AMG up and watering it down to a trim level over the years.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;independent AMG was cocaine on wheels</span>", "filename": "2CFEA679-976A-465D-9F69-F23406108533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 674, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668494309751004, "time": 1668494309, "md5": "PYYo3pTHBUmUagJRUhlOcQ==", "fsize": 271356, "resto": 26068883}, {"no": 26080008, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:44:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26073769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26073769</a><br>I had one.

This combined with the pathetic 3.0 V6 meant the gussies up Galant known as the Sigma was a failure.<br>They also gradually fucked up their sports car lineup in the states as well. The DSM cars, Chrysler&#039;s FWD sports cars, and the captive import Starion (Chrysler Conquest), occupied slightly varying price levels but were essentially in competition with each other in the same showrooms.<br>The GTO/3000GT used a twin-turbo version of the 6G72 3.0 V6 in the highest trims.

That was last year or the year before. And that was the second one to do it. The first one did it on the original engine and gear box. The second one did it on the original engine, but the transmission grenaded at just under 800k miles. Both of them are &quot;hot shot&quot; drivers. Matt Farah&#039;s Lexus LS400 also hit a million miles.<br><br>The most common thing to all massively high mileage cars is regular fluid changes. Even if it goes against the manufacturers advice. For example, BMW, trying to cut costs, extended the oil change intervals in their engines until engines started failing and then very quietly reverted the change. They changed to 15k miles or 24 months. And then changed back to 10k miles or 12 months. I&#039;ve taken the heads off engines owned by pensioners who&#039;re still stuck in the mindset of &quot;change your oil every 5000 miles&quot; and the internals look like the car has just come out of the factory. I&#039;ve taken the heads off engines owned by people who don&#039;t give a shit, or can&#039;t afford a more regular service and the internals look like someone was baking brownies inside. Skoda&#039;s are one we see regularly as they were popular as family wagons and taxis and high mileage taxies (6,7 and 800k miles) are not uncommon.

BMW is just a prime example of what happens when a company tries to cut costs by extending the interval to avoid the cost of the 2,3 or however many years / xx thousand miles service schedule they sell with a new vehicle.<br><br>Jobs where the vehicle is running at a given speed, for prolonged periods of time also increase longevity. Sitting at 55-75 on the highway is a lot easier on an engine than stop and start city traffic. The more agricultural the engine the easier it is too. When I started my apprenticeship back in 2001 we were seeing the end of the Peugeot XUD engines and the old guys bitched about the new HDi engines. The VW 1.9 PD engine was literally taken from the marine division and had a head slapped on it for road use. Years later I would end up bitching about the 2 litre PD engine that was introduced to replace the 1.9 just prior to the common rail TDIs becoming more common because it was always something to do with the DPF or other emissions bullshit that failed. The only upside to the CR over the PD engine is more intricate tuning potential. <br><br>This is an experiment Mobil oil performed using a BMW E30 325i that did a million miles.

Two were BMWs, one of which had the ZF 6HP, the other had a GM 6L45R in it. Both were very easy to service. Drain the pan (optionally remove pan for filter change), refill through the fill port with a pump. Easy as shit. Once the fluid starts to pour out the fill, just start the engine, then start pumping it in again. Use a scanner to watch transmission temp, once it hits the specified temp, and fluid is just dribbling out of the fill, plug it back up. <br><br>I&#039;ve got two Fords now with 6R80s, its pretty similar, except they have this little dipstick you have to fiddlefuck with that is close to the exhaust which is obviously very hot at operating temps. Put on some gloves for these. Also, no drain plug. Otherwise, no big deal, pretty easy to service.<br><br>Meanwhile, I&#039;ve got an old Chevy Express with a 4L80E in it. Absolutely fuck that transmission sideways with a pineapple. No drain plug, and while it has a dipstick, it is absolutely impossible to read. This cocksucker is 8 feet long, made of tinfoil, and feeding it back into the tube is like sticking a wet spaghetti noodle up a cat&#039;s ass, and half the time it binds up in the tube before getting back in all the way.

At a cost of $30 million dollars, a fully independent Lotus-designed suspension upgraded the 1988 Fiero&#039;s chassis, which finally let the car live up to its performance potential: shorter spindles, smaller scrub radius, reduction of the kingpin angle, longer A-arms, and a 28mm: anti-roll bar replaced the Chevette pieces at the nose. A new subframe with different attaching points, a three-link design, lower spring rates &amp; a 22mm anti-roll bar did away with dated X-car components in the rear, and it received vented disk brakes and staggered wheels for improved handling balance.
