I think the last time Codies remotely gave a fuck about livery design, was Dirt Rally 1, given how they got some obscure BRC liveries in from 2015-2016 and the other liveries still resembled some IRL liveries from other racing series. (Example, the standard Evo X livery in Dirt Rally 1 resembled the Ohlins Racing livery from Grid 1&#039;s DLC Evo X). After Dirt Rally 1, they just tossed any sort of livery in a quick livery editor, and called it a day there.<br>That said, Spyker Squadron was pure SOVL, and it is sad that they went under in a desperate attempt to save Saab in 2011.

If you remember, Porsche had an exclusive licence with Electronic Arts for the Need For Speed games at the time, which meant that while the AI could drive Porsche 911 GT3 RSR cars in GRID 1, the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event. The three teams running the Porsches in the game are all driven by licenced drivers, there is not a single fictional team allowed to drive them. Ferrari also was considering an exclusivity deal around that time, and decided to jank their licence for GRID 1 at the last minute, leading to the Ferrari 430 GT2 and Ferrari 550 Maranello GT1 cars to be cut just for release, which meant traces of those cars were still in the game files at launch, despite being unusable for anyone in the game!", "time": 1674694125, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296332, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;re never getting P2P back</span>", "filename": "TOUGE", "ext": ".webm", "w": 852, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694126443080, "time": 1674694126, "md5": "bk4tjgtmh7KCvFJhv3lI6Q==", "fsize": 2983497, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296341, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event.</span><br>yeah that&#039;s what I was talking about, codies must have had the elms licence , this is exactly how gtr2 got away with porsches and ferraris too", "time": 1674694336, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296321</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ui is ass</span><br>did every ui designer get lobotomized at the same time?", "filename": "1647449061758", "ext": ".webm", "w": 789, "h": 444, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694339879101, "time": 1674694339, "md5": "SA99oqca3AJECLWvgciM6w==", "fsize": 3001982, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296349, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296342</a><br>Why aren&#039;t we allowed actual needles on our gauges anymore?", "time": 1674694445, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296364, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:56:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296143</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t know if they edited out logos.</span><br>Nope, right there on the fender.", "filename": "Race Driver Grid Screenshot 2023.01.13 - 21.07.38.82", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694614565671, "time": 1674694614, "md5": "hmRw+N/dt7C/FDGGdh1Agw==", "fsize": 2208422, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296383, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296349</a><br>devs in big cities traumatized at the sight of a needle", "time": 1674695134, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296387, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:06:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26295633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26295633</a><br>Ugly fugly 70&#039; Challenger.

They should have been leaning much more heavily into the local cultural aspect, taking cues from shows like Travel Man or even James May&#039;s own &quot;Our Man in Japan/Italy&quot; series. (What? You went to Sweden and Finland, and didn&#039;t even force the boys to eat surstr\u00f6mming and salmiakki for a gag?)

What are future trends? Take some hints from May&#039;s old &quot;Cars of the People.&quot;) But no, somehow it&#039;s more entertaining to use these lands as a backdrop for some obviously artificial real-life Wile E.

First, the old truck in the first pic is 2wd vs a 4wd new truck. If you got a 4wd truck back in the old days it came with a factory lift. As an aside, compared to today&#039;s &quot;it snows where I live so I need 4wd&quot; in the old days 4wd trucks weren&#039;t even in the same catalog as the main product line. It was assumed normal people bought 2wd trucks, even if they had to sometimes go a little offroad. Then you had the special catalog for loggers and hunters with the 4wd trucks.<br><br>Second, in the second pic they&#039;re comparing a long bed old truck vs short bed newer trucks. Beds didn&#039;t magically get shorter in 1980. You always could choose an 8&#039; or 6.5&#039; bed. You can still get a single cab, 8&#039; bed truck even if they&#039;re not big sellers. And the newer trucks in that pic are crew cab models which by default. People buy more crewcab trucks with tiny beds because it&#039;s just a way to have an SUV without driving the same car as your wife. I think the only truck combo you can&#039;t get any more is crew cab/long bed.

My friend bought a 2017 Avalon new, and even though I don&#039;t like FWD, that aside, it&#039;s a pretty nice car. Why is Toyota doing this instead of just making a new and better Avalon?", "time": 1674682095, "resto": 26285796}, {"no": 26295751, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:35:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26295727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26295727</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t think it looks bad at all</span><br>I concur, I just wish they didn&#039;t make it as tall as a german &quot;Gran Coupe&quot; a.k.a like an BMW X6", "time": 1674682527, "resto": 26285796}, {"no": 26295763, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:37:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26285796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26285796</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no hybrid option</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no all electric version</span><br>Dead on arrival.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":

I track my S6 routinely. <br><br>The weight over the front axle is real, but is less real every generation. It\u2019s not 1985. Even the V8 in the S4 is as small as the old inline 5. <br><br>You have to understand the new corvette and the 911 C2S come with understeer dialed in from the factory because it\u2019s safer. <br><br>Audi has poor weight distribution (so does a 911 really). But it also has maximum traction in any given scenario. The S and RS cars also have a torque splitting differential. You turn right and the outside rear wheel will overdrive and you\u2019ll find the car oversteers when driven properly. The understeer meme is either out of date, Related to the old S3 and under or a misunderstanding of what understeer is. <br><br>You can feel the weight of the engine when you turn an Audi. Normal fags such as Doug demuro mistake this for \u2018understeer\u2019 and indeed it can contribute to understeer. But understeer does not occur unless the front tires have reach maximum traction and can no longer turn anymore and they are not turning enough. This does not occur on the street. It does not occur even in a golf R until the tires get too hot after a few laps. <br><br>The Audi S cars come with a rather aggressive -2.5 camber stock. I adjust mine to -3.0.

The engine is in the back. You get better traction on the rear wheels but when the gas is applied that extra traction is taken from the front wheels. The result is understeer. <br><br>And 911s and mid engines also have a higher risk of oversteer which can be very expensive if it goes wrong unlike understeer which is easy to manage. Go down the grid at an Indy or F1 race where the cars are \u2018neutral\u2019 by design and you\u2019ll find drivers still prefer under or oversteer dialed in depending on their style. <br><br>The upside to Audi is power and traction. The downside is weight and where the weight is. Idk if Audi has ever made a light weight car. The real downside is the computer and traction management in an S car will constantly be fighting you on track in little ways. It\u2019s too aggressive. It works very well but at the cost of your brake pads. Have to VAG com it down as much as possible. <br><br>As long as you drive an Audi like an AWD car and play to its strengths they\u2019re excellent fun on track. But you can\u2019t drive it like a Caymen and then complain it\u2019s not \u2018as good\u2019. You just have to manage the weight and trail brake and hit the gas hard esrly to make the turn. <br><br>And 911s and all the rest are modded for the track anyway. Race cars have a set up for each track so driving a street car on the track and trying to compare them as if ones better is meaningless. And most guys like Doug demuro and onions pipes havnt got a basic understanding of race car or driving dynamics or suspension.

C4 Corvette may be an exception, but C5 is a better all around buy unless you specifically want a C4.<br><br>-Hard no to Jag, Audi, Eagle/Mitsu/Dodge<br><br>-90&#039;s Firebird/Camaro should be the cheaper end of the list that&#039;s worth buying, just make sure you don&#039;t buy a trashed one. Nice ones shouldn&#039;t be all that much as long as they&#039;re not collector-shape. Pretty much same for Mustang, though probably even cheaper all else equal. Pretty good time to buy a 90&#039;s Mustang honestly.<br><br>-C5 Vette is always a good decision, now is a pretty good time to buy as C8 buyers are unloading their old Vettes and more Boomers age out of driving them every year and prices cascade downward every time a new one comes out.<br><br>-E46 BMW can be a good decision if you get the 330 or 325 and they are rock bottom. If you can snag a 1 or 2 owner one that the most recent owner has owned for like 10 years and took care of, with just a couple of critical checks it can be super solid. Rear subframe and overflow coolant tank are two of the big ones people talk about.<br><br>-BRZ and 350/370z can all be OK, but it&#039;s TOUGH to find a non-clapped out one. Don&#039;t sleep on a G35/37 Coupe or Sedan, either, a G35 Sedan is kind of a Japanese BMW 3 series IMO. My dad had a G35 sedan and that was a nice car to drive, honestly I was reminded of it when I drove an R34 GT-R (not power-wise, but overall feel of everything).<br><br>-Lincoln LS are DIRT CHEAP, not very sporty, but DIRT CHEAP.

The DRZ had plenty of power for roads, but the gear ratios were too close together to make a great dual sport. Either it was geared for dirt or the road, and it would suffer in whichever you didn&#039;t choose. The engine wasn&#039;t particularly smooth either.<br><br>The KLX300 and WR250R are both down on power quite a bit, but their engines are much smoother so winding them out on the road for long durations wasn&#039;t as bothersome, and gear ratios wider so they could reasonably accommodate both road and dirt riding on the same sprocket set. They also feel considerably lighter and more nimble, though the actual weight difference isn&#039;t all that big. The way they carry their weight makes them much easier to ride off road.
