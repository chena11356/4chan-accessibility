The DRZ had plenty of power for roads, but the gear ratios were too close together to make a great dual sport. Either it was geared for dirt or the road, and it would suffer in whichever you didn&#039;t choose. The engine wasn&#039;t particularly smooth either.<br><br>The KLX300 and WR250R are both down on power quite a bit, but their engines are much smoother so winding them out on the road for long durations wasn&#039;t as bothersome, and gear ratios wider so they could reasonably accommodate both road and dirt riding on the same sprocket set. They also feel considerably lighter and more nimble, though the actual weight difference isn&#039;t all that big. The way they carry their weight makes them much easier to ride off road.

But it also has maximum traction in any given scenario. The S and RS cars also have a torque splitting differential.

Normal fags such as Doug demuro mistake this for \u2018understeer\u2019 and indeed it can contribute to understeer. But understeer does not occur unless the front tires have reach maximum traction and can no longer turn anymore and they are not turning enough. This does not occur on the street. It does not occur even in a golf R until the tires get too hot after a few laps. <br><br>The Audi S cars come with a rather aggressive -2.5 camber stock. I adjust mine to -3.0.

The engine is in the back. You get better traction on the rear wheels but when the gas is applied that extra traction is taken from the front wheels. The result is understeer. <br><br>And 911s and mid engines also have a higher risk of oversteer which can be very expensive if it goes wrong unlike understeer which is easy to manage. Go down the grid at an Indy or F1 race where the cars are \u2018neutral\u2019 by design and you\u2019ll find drivers still prefer under or oversteer dialed in depending on their style. <br><br>The upside to Audi is power and traction. The downside is weight and where the weight is. Idk if Audi has ever made a light weight car. The real downside is the computer and traction management in an S car will constantly be fighting you on track in little ways. It\u2019s too aggressive. It works very well but at the cost of your brake pads. Have to VAG com it down as much as possible. <br><br>As long as you drive an Audi like an AWD car and play to its strengths they\u2019re excellent fun on track. But you can\u2019t drive it like a Caymen and then complain it\u2019s not \u2018as good\u2019.

much as anyone, but as a &#039;77 F150 owner I need to point out a couple errors in those pictures. First, the old truck in the first pic is 2wd vs a 4wd new truck. If you got a 4wd truck back in the old days it came with a factory lift. As an aside, compared to today&#039;s &quot;it snows where I live so I need 4wd&quot; in the old days 4wd trucks weren&#039;t even in the same catalog as the main product line. It was assumed normal people bought 2wd trucks, even if they had to sometimes go a little offroad. Then you had the special catalog for loggers and hunters with the 4wd trucks.<br><br>Second, in the second pic they&#039;re comparing a long bed old truck vs short bed newer trucks. Beds didn&#039;t magically get shorter in 1980. You always could choose an 8&#039; or 6.5&#039; bed. You can still get a single cab, 8&#039; bed truck even if they&#039;re not big sellers. And the newer trucks in that pic are crew cab models which by default. People buy more crewcab trucks with tiny beds because it&#039;s just a way to have an SUV without driving the same car as your wife. I think the only truck combo you can&#039;t get any more is crew cab/long bed.

To start, unless you are prepared to shill out big dollars for a &#039;collectors&#039; car like an e420, or e500, or some early 4matic, look for the basic and oddball cars. For example, I bought an 88 300ce. First year of production, less desirable motor, less power, but still cool looking and unique. 123 coupes are in much the same place (slept on) but you can get a turbodesiel coupe. Or look for wagons or the basic sedans. Make sure it has been somewhat well kept, the real Mercedes killer is simple neglect. When you have selected your funnyduddy car, realize now that these are shockingly basic cars. If you NEED cool little gizmos and gadgets, buy 210 or 140/129. They are all also very slow and handle rather poorly. Not sporty cars outside the dedicated models (e500/420). Get beneath the car next. Dependable or not, they are all very old and seals and gaskets and hoses are not designed to last 30 plus years. Look for leaks of any kind, and assess if its A) livable or B) fixable. While you are under there, check for rust. Again, while this isnt a Merc specific problem, its a 30yo car problem. Next check the body itself for rust, especially around the rear glass and sunroof (if equipped) as well as other common areas for rust like the bottom and corners of doors and wheel arches. Now the Merc specific issues. Fuel system is somewhat temperamental, expect issues on 124s with pumps and possibly injectors (something i am dealing with now). M104s can be known to consume headgaskets, but that is fairly rare. Thats about it since I dont know too much about the diesels. These are all sub 10k cars, some sub 5k for high miles but dont let mileage scare you, my 202 is at 242kmi and is still going strong.", "time": 1674568958, "resto": 26285901}, {"no": 26291248, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)09:03:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26291243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26291243</a><br>Forgot pic", "filename": "A6D5667C-A0CF-49F4-92B3-6C80BA6086F5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 958, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674569019208691, "time": 1674569019, "md5": "LUyIhytfLBLgSHa8vD7dQQ==", "fsize": 608472, "resto": 26285901}, {"no": 26291256, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)09:07:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26290853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26290853</a><br>The &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;it&#039;s an investment&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; copium is how I justify spending so much on cars.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

Hence why I am total shit at Assetto Corsa, but that aside.<br>First thing you want to get the hang of, is to find a pace for yourself to consistently finish stages without crashing. Might sound like stating the obvious, but given how it is RBR, and rate of attrition is usually high in events, finishing events without wrecking out usually sees you moving up the ranking. Doesn&#039;t matter if some hotlapping Frenchman on tarmac beats you and the rest of the field by a full minute or more, just focus on your own pace without crashing first. Once you get the feeling that you are consistently reaching the finish, start pushing your own pace and confidence more and more, bit by bit. As long you don&#039;t crash doing so, you are constantly improving on your pace.<br>A quick way to learn, is to find a car and stage combination you are comfortable with, and start getting a feeling for how hard you can push that specific car / set-up without crashing or spinning out. You want to get in that flow where you can push the car hard without having the feeling that you might crash in the next two corners. Being comfortable in the car is what you want, it&#039;s nearly impossible to push hard with a car that you have the feeling of that you can bin it every second. If I drive a car that keeps never understeering or oversteering the entire time, I also focus on just making it to the line than to push hard. On tarmac, you want lots of grip and decent performance in hairpins, on looser surfaces like snow and gravel, you&#039;d really want to find the flow where you can slide consistently sideways without spinning or crashing out.
