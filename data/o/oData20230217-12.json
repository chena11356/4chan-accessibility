Being surrounded by trees while climbing to the top of a narrow, twisty mountain road, to then be greeted by a scenic outlook over the 1/3rd of the island is a vastly superior choice. I&#039;ve been driving for 12 years and have never crashed or been ticketed. The only thing I&#039;ve paid for has been gas and parts. Also, the nearest track is over 2k miles from me (I live on an island,) and it would cost a minimum of $4k just to ship my shitbox round trip before even considering travel expenses. I have no interest in wasting hours in a day researching the best prices for hotels, tickets, and shipping costs, and then needing to wait for it to get between destinations, and then take days off just to go driving to drive during their operational hours on whatever days they allow, when I can just immediately go out for a drive whenever I feel like it for free and also come back to the comfort of my own home at any time. As I said, it&#039;s possible to speed responsibly. I don&#039;t care if that makes your butt hurt. Yeah, there are a lot of shitty drivers on the road, but drunk drivers are significantly more hazardous than some people going for some spirited driving in the mountains or dragging on a lone straight.

In my province of British Columbia they implemented this over 10 years ago. While it was mainly chinks in their high powered exotic cars racing around Vancouver that led to civil forfeiture being a thing, here&#039;s the problem with that: Around the same time they also implemented short to longer term impounds of vehicles for street racing. So you&#039;ll lose your ride for at least 7 days, pay a hefty fine plus towing/storage costs, and possibly lose your license if you have prior history of racing/stunting. I believe this to be more than enough to handle anyone that&#039;s a problem. Now, while I have no problems with rich Hongers getting fucked here, police are given a wide margin of discretion on when to simply impound, or seize for civil forfeiture. Stunting/street racing here encompasses a variety of things... Simply burning rubber could technically get your shit seized for forfeiture, although I&#039;m not aware of this happening. Simply spinning your tires on a slick wet street could get your shit impounded, whether you meant to or not. The law here is very vague, in what you can do and can&#039;t do, and what repercussions you may face. Of course we all have our chance in court here to &#039;tell it to the judge&#039;, but never before has civil forfeiture been a thing here for vehicles unless they were proven to be bought by proceeds of crime (drug dealers), or utilized in a serious crime (robbing a bank). The threshold for forfeiture has dropped too low now, where spinning tires in the wet could be considered stunting, which is now considered stunting, now considered a serious crime, leading to possible seizure.", "time": 1676457728, "resto": 26357406}, {"no": 26359193, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:05:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;26358964</span><br>The laws we have are put in place by people elected by the majority.<br>Laws change depending on what&#039;s required at the time.<br>You are welcome to try and convince the majority to be soft on crime, see how that works out for you.", "time": 1676466302, "resto": 26357406}, {"no": 26359198, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:09:57", "name": "Bepis", "com": "<a href=\"#p26357523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26357523</a><br>Agree with this<br><br>But that\u2019s also not really a Florida facist law, that shit happens all over.

Most of you probably already know this, but for those who don\u2019t, the old USPS trucks have the crude 2.5 Pushrod I4 \u201cIron Duke\u201d engine, which is basically one of their 5.0 V8s with one bank removed. It was at first carbureted but fuel injection later took it from subpar to at least adequate performance. It was a torquey pig compared to Japan\u2019s finely-tuned, but weaker I4s. <br><br>Anyway, it supposedly only gets ~8 MPG on trips, and ~6 with running AC. 3,000 lb curb weight + up to 1,000 lb in cargo and let\u2019s say a ~150 lb driver\u2026 for a vehicle and a 3-speed powertrain from the late 70s this isn\u2019t too bad. The new mail truck perplexes me. It has a 2.0 Ecoboost engine, an 8-speed automatic. It only gets ~14 MPG on runs, ~8.5 with running AC. It seems like their are two issues. For one, the vehicle is too heavy, it\u2019s stated to be approximately 5,500 lbs, and yes- this is the ICE version\u2019s weight. The engine\u2018s displacement is not overkill for the truck\u2019s current weight of 5,500 lbs\u2026 but how the fuck did it gain over 2,000 lbs? If it stayed in the 3k or even low 4k range it could have gotten away with a beefed up I3 Ecoboost.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis. NISMO took the IMPUL\u2019s BNR34 late that year to replicate the 1999 JGTC GT500 drivers champion.", "filename": "FB_IMG_1673585266991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673585392639516, "time": 1673585392, "md5": "t8wMmXF9+Cx8wsbu2Hs4kA==", "fsize": 34737, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254117, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:14:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253422</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1673586878, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254558, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Means the NSX NC1 is fully dead", "time": 1673600243, "resto": 26252207}, {"no": 26254736, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)06:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26253697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26253697</a><br>Cool!

that received particular attention in Japan\u2019s rich racing history was a Ferrari.<br>The Team Taisan Star Card F40.<br><br>At the time, the Italian GT Championship saw European dream cars such as the Porsche 964 Carrera RS and the Jaguar XJ220 line-up against each other. But when Yasutsune Chiba, the head of Team Taisan, came across an article in a magazine about how the F40 was dominating in Europe, he couldn\u2019t help but dream of the F40 racing around Japanese circuits.<br><br>Chiba immediately bought an F40 and showed it off at the Fuji Speedway for the opening round of the JGTC season. The red body-coloured supercar was, of course, the talk of the race fans and drew a lot of attention. At the time, however, F40 racing parts were hard to come by and the car had to be driven in a virtually stock configuration. Despite its reputation, the F40 struggled to keep up with the other teams, who had built their cars with a wealth of experience.<br><br>However, for Chiba, running the F40 in a Japanese race series meant a lot to him and he refused to give up, improving the car race by race. This gradually paid off and they took pole position at the 4th round in Sugo. The team then brought in Oscar Larrauri, a former Italian GT Championship driver, to drive the car and team to victory.<br><br>In 1994, in the final race of the season, held at the Mine Circuit, the F40 made a spectacular start and took the lead, but the 962C, also from Team Taisan, was following closely.

I also stated that certain vendors should be removed because some of the content that they make isn&#039;t exactly geared towards the people here and people would find it irritating to see, amongst other reasons. Taiyo made the decision to keep everyone the way it is, and I stand with him on that even though I would have acted differently initially.<br><br>I would only suggest to him to remove someone if they were actively scamming, dead website, false advertising and so on.

In my own opinion when it comes to non-OSG vendors, I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up. This isn&#039;t a critique about Super Effective either, but for example if you encounter stores with pre-orders, poorly printed apparel being sold at ridiculous prices, various type of coomer products and etc without easy channels to reach them on their page, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at the lack of support because they&#039;ve made and spent enough money on other things and furthering their own business to give a shit about having a proper system for customer support.

Granted, the review system was an impromptu idea, there may or may not be better alternatives that I haven&#039;t thought out. A benefit of a review system is being able to see the frequency of getting a blem in the mail, consistent shipping times, re-stocks, etc. So even though a vendor may not fit the criteria for deletion for messing up a few orders or not having good QC, it&#039;ll be up to the buyer&#039;s discretion to use this information of how to spend their money. It&#039;s also provides the benefit of vendors not being able to hide negative reviews as a third party repository. I can assure you that if people wanted to say things about me and what happened last time, Taiyo wouldn&#039;t delete it and he would stop working with me if I suggested censorship to save a couple of bucks.

extended fiberglass roof and no rear seat called the BX Van was produced in Finland. At the time vans had to pay a smaller registration tax than passenger cars so people wanted to be able to register the BX as a van. The regular BX estate couldn&#039;t be registered as a van in Finland because Finnish law required vans to have a cargo space at least 130 centimeters high and 2.5m3 in cargo volume, lengthwise measured awkwardly from inner boot lid to the bottom of steering wheel (nobody knows the whole phenomena on how the volume was counted back in times). The higher roof was achieved by cutting off the original steel roof and replacing it with a large box made of fiberglass. The BX Van was quite popular and over 2000 of them were sold.", "time": 1676617264, "resto": 26361577}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26363953, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)20:41:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone here even drive a Lexus\u2026", "filename": "32846669-F33A-4400-B54E-1C9A4C6D8EF5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 813, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 158, "tim": 1676598093602811, "time": 1676598093, "md5": "YhquuXXEuSwev9ivzxE5iQ==", "fsize": 199154, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-anyone-here-even-drive-a-lexus", "replies": 12, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 26364013, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)21:14:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26363953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26363953</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posts Toyota</span><br>What did you mean by this?", "time": 1676600069, "resto": 26363953}, {"no": 26364030, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)21:21:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I have a 2023 IS350.", "time": 1676600488, "resto": 26363953}, {"no": 26364111, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)21:53:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26363953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26363953</a><br>I drive a 2002 Sportcross", "time": 1676602391, "resto": 26363953}, {"no": 26364153, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:07:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26364013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26364013</a><br>Posted for the Japanese girl Anon", "time": 1676603250, "resto": 26363953}, {"no": 26364175, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:17:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26363953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26363953</a><br>i drive a pre-lexus<br>one of these days when i remember and am not fucken lazy i&#039;ll take a proper photo of my car", "filename": "20230109_180046", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3088, "h": 3088, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676603829204130, "time": 1676603829, "md5": "jahqgRnrqLUe/H7OdszdkQ==", "fsize": 3439312, "resto": 26363953}, {"no": 26364209, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:29:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26364175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26364175</a><br>Is this a mirrored photo ?

Just because it was just that little bit closer.<br><br>On coming out I saw some lady in a car backing out, very poorly, but obviously backing out and some dude in a Tacoma just drives right up bumper to bumper behind her despite being on a road wide enough for 3 cars to pass and he just sits there and waits, perplexes and agitated that this car is in his way, until she drives forward a little enough for him to drive arrow straight still going within inches of her car and then rolling down the window to scram at her while blowing his horn and then zoom off.<br><br>I then realized that the AI in GTA4 was in fact accurate.", "time": 1676545649, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362110, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:22:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BMW driver refuses to find another spot because he knows his car might not last another 50 yards</span>", "time": 1676546550, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362148, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:50:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359606</a><br><a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw black</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have asian gf</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to mall</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sends me out to hold parker spot three banks over while she drives over</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;karen going wrong direction in parking lane instantly appears</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;you cant stand there sir&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stare at her while saying nothing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she discombabulates into threatening to call the police and mall security</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she gives up deflated and attempts to go wrong direction</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;has to back out the entire lane</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;asian gf finally arrives and almost scrapes the car next to her</span>", "time": 1676548236, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362179, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:11:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362148</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;asian gf finally arrives and almost scrapes the car next to her</span><br>this is what you get for not driving yourself", "time": 1676549476, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362188, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:18:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362148</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw black</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hold parker spot three banks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;threatening to call the police </span><br>Bruh you&#039;re lucky she didn&#039;t, pigs would have rolled up and shot you for no fucking reason.", "time": 1676549903, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362200, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:25:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360406</a><br>The fucking DeVry shirt.", "time": 1676550312, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362203, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:25:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359487</a><br>she soo fucking fat, she need to park her fat ass in parking spot XDDDD LAMOOOO", "time": 1676550342, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362215, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:30:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360423</a><br>Marrying a hologram of your favorite anime girl doesn&#039;t count.", "time": 1676550628, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362223, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26362179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362179</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gf wants to drive everytime we take my car</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;always take my car because hers is boring</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refuses to get non boring car &quot;its too expensive&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pays $800 a month with an insurances for a honda accord</span><br><br><a href=\"#p26362188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26362188</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no raisin</span>", "filename": "1599819312775", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676550874014484, "time": 1676550874, "md5": "iQmfiHw/RhgHvLPel1ZfvA==", "fsize": 558551, "resto": 26359487}, {"no": 26362227, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:35:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26360406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26360406</a><br>lose some weight.

Cars are are pretty rough on things. I had a TPS that developed a dead spot just on throttle. Didn&#039;t render the car undrivable, but it was an annoying jerk until I finally figured out what was causing the problem. I have some old audio equipment where the pots still work flawlessly. Others not so much. I once made the mistake of outfitting a couple of my electrical guitars with the bottom of the barrel pots from my catalog because I was poor and everything was just wicked pisser until 5-10 years later they start getting scratchy and mechanically fidgity. Oh well. Easy fix now that I know it counts to pay for the nicer stuff decent manufacturers use.<br><br>But to the moving parts argument. I also had a car where the ABS started acting up constantly. Problem? Tone rings had corroded away. Now tone rings are attached to wheels, and wheels move, but neither the ring nor the sensor itself is truly a moving part. It didn&#039;t corrode any faster by moving other than that the entire car moved through corrosive environments for a long enough time. So it&#039;s a little one dimensional to say that a &quot;moving part&quot; is categorically less reliable than a &quot;non-moving part&quot;. Plenty of PCB type stuff might fail despite being made of non-moving parts because the environment was hostile enough to move it enough to break solder joints, burst capacitors, corrode connections, or whatever else.", "time": 1676589682, "resto": 26351121}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 26359020, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)04:12:50", "name": "S/o/viet", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;/o/ will seethe at this.</span>", "filename": "20230212_093557", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676452370808523, "time": 1676452370, "md5": "kdswnj7dMs4Cpm7iVeGBPQ==", "fsize": 780913, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "o-will-seethe-at-this", "replies": 44, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 39}, {"no": 26359024, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)04:16:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26359020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26359020</a><br>Of course I do.
