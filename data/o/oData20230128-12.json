These things are equipped in all amazon branded vans these days and are basically a state trooper working constantly against the driver. It informs their boss (usually a third party) and Amazon of any bad driving habits and marks them as infractions towards the delivery company working for amazon. Said infractions can be used against the driver, and usually result in reduced working days. One particular infraction that can really fuck a driver over, aside from the generic speeding outside the highway, running a stop/red, distracted driving, is driving too close to another car. The camera, however, doesn&#039;t know the difference between the driver not maintaining a safe distance and getting cut off by someone. So the result is usually the camera giving the driver an infraction for &#039;not keeping a safe distance&#039;, even though they just got cut off, and the driver getting reduced hours (for most third party amazon delivery companies).

You underestimate how sensitive (retarded) the camera is to other cars merging in front of it. The vans are usually topped to 70 mph, for every 10 mph it wants you to be about 1 van length apart from whatever car is front of you, otherwise the camera considers the driver being too close and marks it as an infraction. If the driver is out on a highway doing 65 mph, the camera is expecting the driver to be 6 van lengths apart, and thats if the camera THINKS its at a proper range. Look how fucking long this thing is. Now what if a commuter wants to merge in front of the van at a safe distance? If the piece of shit camera doesnt catch a car moving from another lane into its path, its going to assume the car was always there and the van driver is driving too close. Bam, infraction. UNLESS the van driver brakes just a bit enough to let camera know that the van is slowing a safe distance, and no, letting off the gas does not count.

I think the last time Codies remotely gave a fuck about livery design, was Dirt Rally 1, given how they got some obscure BRC liveries in from 2015-2016 and the other liveries still resembled some IRL liveries from other racing series. (Example, the standard Evo X livery in Dirt Rally 1 resembled the Ohlins Racing livery from Grid 1&#039;s DLC Evo X). After Dirt Rally 1, they just tossed any sort of livery in a quick livery editor, and called it a day there.<br>That said, Spyker Squadron was pure SOVL, and it is sad that they went under in a desperate attempt to save Saab in 2011.

If you remember, Porsche had an exclusive licence with Electronic Arts for the Need For Speed games at the time, which meant that while the AI could drive Porsche 911 GT3 RSR cars in GRID 1, the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event. The three teams running the Porsches in the game are all driven by licenced drivers, there is not a single fictional team allowed to drive them. Ferrari also was considering an exclusivity deal around that time, and decided to jank their licence for GRID 1 at the last minute, leading to the Ferrari 430 GT2 and Ferrari 550 Maranello GT1 cars to be cut just for release, which meant traces of those cars were still in the game files at launch, despite being unusable for anyone in the game!", "time": 1674694125, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296332, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:48:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;re never getting P2P back</span>", "filename": "TOUGE", "ext": ".webm", "w": 852, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694126443080, "time": 1674694126, "md5": "bk4tjgtmh7KCvFJhv3lI6Q==", "fsize": 2983497, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296341, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the player couldn&#039;t buy or drive them for his own team, only for the licenced teams for a series hire or for the licenced teams in a non-career event.</span><br>yeah that&#039;s what I was talking about, codies must have had the elms licence , this is exactly how gtr2 got away with porsches and ferraris too", "time": 1674694336, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296342, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:52:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296321</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ui is ass</span><br>did every ui designer get lobotomized at the same time?", "filename": "1647449061758", "ext": ".webm", "w": 789, "h": 444, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694339879101, "time": 1674694339, "md5": "SA99oqca3AJECLWvgciM6w==", "fsize": 3001982, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296349, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296342</a><br>Why aren&#039;t we allowed actual needles on our gauges anymore?", "time": 1674694445, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296364, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:56:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296143</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t know if they edited out logos.</span><br>Nope, right there on the fender.", "filename": "Race Driver Grid Screenshot 2023.01.13 - 21.07.38.82", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674694614565671, "time": 1674694614, "md5": "hmRw+N/dt7C/FDGGdh1Agw==", "fsize": 2208422, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296383, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26296349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26296349</a><br>devs in big cities traumatized at the sight of a needle", "time": 1674695134, "resto": 26295004}, {"no": 26296387, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:06:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p26295633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;26295633</a><br>Ugly fugly 70&#039; Challenger.

If you live in an area with a lot of salt then chances are parts of it can corrode internally. Is the alternator not charging at all? You should try to stick a multimeter to the battery poles with the car running and check the voltage. If it&#039;s less than 14V you probably have a bad alternator.

The cost in paying him to print the stickers would be exploiting and underpaying him, or it would end up charging the customer out the ass.

I personally would and have gone with the NB miata 1.8 with the torsen differential and it was a great car to drive in the winter because it has ABS so it will stop, but it has no traction control or any other nonsense to limit fun. every corner will be taken sideways when there&#039;s snow and ice, for me it was more of a winter car than a summer car. convertibles are kinda overrated if you don&#039;t live in california or something, and even if so, going 50 mph or faster just means you&#039;d rather have the top up. and if you have the top up, you want AC.

&#039;77 F150 owner I need to point out a couple errors in those pictures. First, the old truck in the first pic is 2wd vs a 4wd new truck. If you got a 4wd truck back in the old days it came with a factory lift. As an aside, compared to today&#039;s &quot;it snows where I live so I need 4wd&quot; in the old days 4wd trucks weren&#039;t even in the same catalog as the main product line. It was assumed normal people bought 2wd trucks, even if they had to sometimes go a little offroad. Then you had the special catalog for loggers and hunters with the 4wd trucks.<br><br>Second, in the second pic they&#039;re comparing a long bed old truck vs short bed newer trucks. Beds didn&#039;t magically get shorter in 1980. You always could choose an 8&#039; or 6.5&#039; bed. You can still get a single cab, 8&#039; bed truck even if they&#039;re not big sellers. And the newer trucks in that pic are crew cab models which by default. People buy more crewcab trucks with tiny beds because it&#039;s just a way to have an SUV without driving the same car as your wife. I think the only truck combo you can&#039;t get any more is crew cab/long bed.

It was a rare and unique opportunity to see all the Pennzoil-sponsored NISMO GT500 cars together. And let me tells you: the legendary american oil brand stopped to sponsor one of two NISMO official team chassis in 2000 JGTC season, but returned to 2001 for sponsor the ex-LOCTITE ZEXEL GT-R car, becoming the \u2018Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R\u2019 that year. Different from the 1998 R33, and 1999 R34 Pennzoil GT500 champions, and even helping NISMO to win the 2001 season on team standings along with the sister chassis, the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R has been updated to \u2018Castrol PITWORK GT-R\u2019 for 2002, losing the yellow livery and the Pennzoil sponsor once again. So yes, it means that the Pennzoil ZEXEL GT-R is no longer around us.<br><br>Another curious fact, , is that the Pennzoil NISMO GT-R BCNR33 and BNR34 pictured here aren\u2019t \u201coriginal\u201d cars, but replica based on other chassis. Respectively, they are the 1998 ZEXEL SKYLINE and 1999 CALSONIC SKYLINE repainted as Pennzoil-sponsored cars for NISMO\u2019s heritage.<br><br>The original Pennzoil BCNR33 has the low-downforce kit and Nicos GT banner and sometimes can be seen appearing in some events, including the NISMO FESTIVAL itself. The original Pennzoil BNR34 however, has been lost. It was upgraded to \u2018Castrol NISMO GT-R\u2019 for 2000 JGTC season, but the car crashed in the first round, being replaced by a new bespoke chassis.

turbocharged three-cylinder 12-valve engine from the Daihatsu Charade GTTi was scorched by problems mating up the electronics, but rather than scaling back his ambitions, Bruen went even wider, He began looking for a car with a wheelbase that would match the 92.3-inch (2345 mm) Twingo\u2019s, and found one in the Ferrari 308 (92.1 inches, 2340 mm), which had a separate chassis, so theoretically could be fairly easily fused with the little Renault.<br><br><br>\u201cThe good thing was that the Ferrari came from a different [older] period, so the track was not that wide, whereas the Twingo, for its category was a very wide car,\u201d remembers Breun.<br><br>But although he persuaded Renault to donate an unused Twingo shell and came close on more than one occasion to buying an accident-damaged 308 to get the project really rolling, Breun couldn\u2019t quite pull the funds together to make it happen.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA<wbr>Cf-txT48", "filename":
