The attackers said 3 times they would stop the attack if ProtonMail CTO, Dr. Butler, apologized. Dr. Butler would not apologize for publicly mocking and goading the attacker, so the DDoS continued. ProtonMail tried to blame the DDoS attacks on Russia,[16] jumping onto the &quot;Just blame Russia&quot; bandwagon.

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter.

In this context, stable diffusion refers to the process of blending or mixing the generated images with a set of real images, in order to stabilize the training process and improve the quality of the generated images.<br><br>There are several different ways in which stable diffusion can be used to generate images using GANs. One approach is to use a hybrid loss function that combines the traditional GAN loss with an additional term that encourages the generated images to be similar to a set of real images. This can help to prevent the GAN from collapsing into a &quot;degenerate&quot; state, where it produces the same or similar images over and over again.<br><br>Another approach is to use a &quot;history buffer&quot; to store a set of generated images and gradually blend them with the current set of generated images over time. This can help to smooth out fluctuations in the generated images and improve their overall quality.<br><br>Regardless of the specific approach used, the goal of stable diffusion in GANs is to improve the training process and produce more realistic, high-quality images. This is typically done by iteratively updating the GAN&#039;s model parameters based on the loss function, which measures the difference between the generated images and the real images. As the GAN&#039;s training progresses, it should learn to generate images that are increasingly similar to the real images, resulting in a stable and high-quality output.", "time": 1672701437, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90667712, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:17:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90667609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90667609</a>", "filename": "7D82024B-DCB7-4EFF-B457-4DFD2F5BDE50", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 722, "h": 660, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672701455713783, "time": 1672701455, "md5": "J1+dqN2gTW3qgEkU5enAHA==", "fsize": 202797, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90667904, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:28:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90664816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90664816</a><br>they realized more people can start making art / games and such and that scares them because leftist need these things to be propaganda machines. if normal people can start making stuff, normal people won&#039;t be interjecting leftism into their work and that means less leftist propaganda being put out there.<br><br>i highly recommend reading uncle ted&#039;s manifesto about the dangers of technology and the abuse advance AI and technology will bring. he has two chapters dedicated talking about how the left is the dangerous one when it comes to this stuff. the left hates anything non leftist in its nature. if they cannot control it, then they will want to ban it. its why he didn&#039;t want the left to be apart of his anti technology crusade.", "filename": "uncle-ted-dangers-of-leftism-1", "ext": ".png", "w": 1666, "h": 1468, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 110, "tim": 1672702107073310, "time": 1672702107, "md5": "/lLvgjQW27BF1skuULIfNA==", "fsize": 734132, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90667953, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:31:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90667904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90667904</a><br>216 is a really must read. right now the left may be opposing it, but its because the current AI movements are not inherently leftist. the moment leftist can get a stranglehold on AI, then the left will suddenly be supportive of AI.", "time": 1672702273, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90667975, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:32:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90667609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90667609</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;another leftypol seething about /pol/</span><br>many such cases", "time": 1672702338, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90668118, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:39:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90667154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90667154</a><br>White or &quot;fellow white&quot;?", "time": 1672702766, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90668178, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:42:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90668118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90668118</a><br>Ich werde dich einfach unter &quot;behindert&quot; einsortieren und ignorieren", "time": 1672702938, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90668226, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:44:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90667712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90667712</a><br>umm obviously you save Mr Trump so he gives you a reward of at least 5M dollars", "time": 1672703089, "resto": 90664816}, {"no": 90669055, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90664907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90664907</a><br>When I saw the thumbnail, I tought that it was that SA post where the guy thinks that the age of consent should be lowered.

There are a lot of idiots out there who think adhering to &quot;true Unix&quot; tradition means a bunch of shitty ncurses interfaces, but suckless is one of the few groups that really understands the appeal of Unix tools, because they&#039;re not shitty ncurses interfaces, and they&#039;re not even shitty, interactive CLI interfaces; Unix tools are one-dimensional. They&#039;re singular in there application, with no superlatives or quality-of-life features, and a pleasant side-affect of that is that they&#039;re light and pipe-able. Emacs works best as a frontend for software like that. Surf is somewhat neutered, so it depends on dmenu to sort of carry things from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;, something that what otherwise be poorly-implemented by the browser itself, like issuing search search queries and searching for arbitrary text, but the funny thing is, Emacs does precisely that, except better. I can interact with Surf via Emacs in precisely the same way dmenu is used to interact with Surf, and that simply wouldn&#039;t be possible if it weren&#039;t for suckless&#039; paradoxically humble elitism. Emacs loves simple applications, because it&#039;s easy to take something intentionally shallow and effectively create your own toolkit with Elisp.

Software that is better in principle comes with everything you need. software that is inferior does not, and someone has to fill it in. They do it by building tools. Every third-party \u201ctool\u201d is actually a weakness: it\u2019s doing something that either didn\u2019t need to have been done at all, or could have been done better in the first place. however, it creates a community. There\u2019s a way for people to contribute. It\u2019s like a game that leaves little bonuses lying around for people to pocket. If even a novice can make a small contribution, so much better. They feel good about themselves, and now they\u2019ve made a commitment to that ecosystem. The switching costs suddenly became significantly higher. In the realm of programming languages, this is especially true. And in fact, to be \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of size, perhaps every language should start out somewhat flawed.. it should have bad scope rules, weird modules, funky overloading, floating points as the only numbers, and so on. To a rational observer, this might seem an awful idea. but programmers, as a species, have gotten acculturated to salt mines as a natural habitat. They will think nothing of it. Of course, you need something to draw them in: \u201cone weird trick\u201d that lets them do entirely unnecessary and perhaps wholly unwise things that let them demonstrate virtuosity. The latter draws them in, and the former seals the commitment. One could view C++ templates as a form of the latter.<br><br>Customers regard more highly an organization that has recovered well from failure than one that had not yet failed. Good designs are like the latter: they do not fail, and therefore cannot pleasantly surprise you.

A language should not include everything and every library is not a weakness.  You don&#039;t know the first thing about maintaining code. When you add a feature you are making a commitment to it. The features you add increase scope. The point of a language is to build a tool to solve problems. A good language is flexible enough to solve any or most problems while being well optimized and easy to use. That or it is designed to solve a specific problem very well. 3rd party libraries are recognition of a good language. If someone with no connection to your language wants to maintain a 3rd party library in it for free that means you have done a good job. They view your language as being worthy of their free time. 3rd party libraries are important to a language because they allow you to solve more problems out of the box while not expanding the language maintainers scope. It means someone else has made a promise to maintain that problem domain.

Mapping between sets is already an abstract concept and then imagining problems like that is another layer of abstraction. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it can be imperative </span><br>Almost no one uses lisp like that. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you are responding </span><br>Yes because you argue it was a mistake not to implement it in lisp, but then ignore the fact that lisp is less popular and more fragmented than python. Implementing in common lisp would only allow a subset of the lisp community to use the ML libraries while implementing in python would allow all of the python community to use it. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you read the essay I linked </span><br>Yes, but his argument fails to materialize in real life. The mythic 20 to 1 ratio only really applies in C and more verbose languages and isn&#039;t as big as a lead in python. If you were to use his approach for something like ML you would require people to learn both lisp and the DSL that would come with tensor. Also his approach has a fragmenting effect on reusability as every program or library that you would write would end up with its own DSL. This again is an issue of sub fragmenting a language. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;learn common lisp instead of parroting /g/ memes</span><br>What /g/ memes?

Still, I *think* you can emulate this perfectly by sending the image to img2img and running that with the same prompt and an output resolution of what you desire - which is extremely close to what HiResFix automates in the first place, possibly even identical (uncertain).<br><br><a href=\"#p90676575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90676575</a><br>1) Which upscaler did you use for the left hand one and which upscaler did you use for the right hand one<br>2) Did you have &quot;Upscale latent space for hires fix&quot; ticked for the left hand one?<br>3) What was your firstpass resolution for the old one, and what was your firstpass resolution for the new one?

So I THINK that means to recreate the old one you want to be setting the resolution to 512x512 to get the identical composition, but then you can no longer recreate the exact pixel perfect new image, instead you need to just set the upscale number to 2 or 3 or whatever so that it&#039;s nice and big, then crop it yourself, i think it&#039;ll come out with a bunch of background space to her left and right. In the past it was silently cropping the sides and you were just &quot;lucky&quot; that she happened to only be filling the centre of the frame; it&#039;s a shame this change breaks the ability to exactly re-obtain old upscales for people who were using 0x0 (and therefore their images were getting cropped when non-square), but eh, it&#039;s well worth it i think.

No fancy object-oriented nonsense or convoluted type systems here. Just straightforward, efficient code that gets the job done. And don&#039;t even get me started on Python and its inability to handle real-world applications.

The simplified version of this is I want to be able to do:<br>cat items.list | ./myscript.sh<br>which will output a numbered list of the lines in items.list and allow me to enter a number and press enter. To be clear this isn&#039;t the problem I&#039;m trying to solve, but this shows the problem that is blocking progress on my bash project.<br>Here&#039;s an example script called myscript.sh that will echo keyboard input as well as terminal lines and cols just as dummy data.<br>You can see that it works fine calling it with `./myscript.sh`. However piping anything into it causes the screen to flash weirdly and nothing works as expected (`cat items.list | ./myscript.sh`). Someone suggested I feed the process into a 4th file descriptor which I haven&#039;t been able to make work. It&#039;s unclear if I should tell `read` to use a 4th file descriptor or instead isolate the stdin from the pipe and change that to a 4th file descriptor. I&#039;ve tried both and the problem remains so I must be misunderstanding something.<br>One last thing, I know one might like to write this with regular input redirection instead of a pipe.

How fast they drain depends on capacity of the battery and obviously on the current pulled from it, not on voltage. Any device designed for AA batteries should have a dropout voltage (i.e. when it turns off due to the batteries being dead) of about 0.9V per cell, since if the battery voltage has dropped that low then most of the energy stored in the cell has been extracted. This is an entirely appropriate voltage level for both alkaline AAs (non-rechargeable, 1.5V nominal) and also for NiMH (rechargeable, 1.2V nominal) because they have different discharge curves, as in the 1.5V alkalines start at higher voltage but have a steeper drop while NiMH start at lower voltage but don&#039;t drop quite as fast. Ultimately, like I said, any device capable of extracting most of the energy from a 1.5V cell will also extract most of the energy from a 1.2V NiMH.<br><br>I suppose it&#039;s possible you used them on some super retarded device that&#039;s literally built wrong and wastes battery capacity by having its dropout set far too high, but that is going to die early on all types of batteries, though for NiMH it would be even worse.

The reason for this is that a common workflow is generate a dozen pics with base resolution, then enable hires and upscale the best one; currently, doing this requires you to re-enter all the resolutions every time since you need to transfer your base resolution into the new sliders and set your new resolution in the base sliders.

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br><br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br><br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

No idea why chinks do that.<br>Got myself this laptop, extra RAM stick, HDD and hopefully less trashy SSD and I&#039;m loving it so far (picture is taken straight out of the box before upgrades).<br>Bought it specifically because it has a proper CPU and is fully upgradeable.<br>Overall build quality is adequate, no issues with keyboard or touchpad, everything works smoothly. Webcam is kind of trash. Speakers are trash.

It just needs some effort put into it and with the vanishing of RegularOP it managed to sustain itself a little, but deteriorated over time. Threads would be irregular, always use the same pictures, never had news and the OP text got progressively more outdated.<br>I eventually decided to put some effort in, at least by making a proper OP picture with the previous thread&#039;s posts as well as writing actual news again. The thread started regaining vitality pretty quickly after that thanks to various anons reviewing purchases and posting OC (big thanks to them at this point). Since then we have even managed to update the guide (the static site isn&#039;t done yet, but the new guide is a lot more in-depth and better than the old one).<br>That line that triggers your filter is actually boilertext from before I took over the thread. I see little reason to change it since it&#039;s accurate but personally I am not in any way married to that sentence. That being said, if your filter rules are shit and catch other threads you want, that&#039;s primarily a you problem and expecting the threads to adjust their writing rather than changing your filters to reflect the (never changing) op texts is pretty foolish. Or just whitelist the threads. The word &quot;China&quot; will appear sometimes in the news anyways, so it wouldn&#039;t even fix your issue. <br>I have a regex rule that filters mass replying people, which used to get triggered by the news. Obviously it&#039;d be strange to expect the OP to change the formatting of the news and instead I adjusted the filter rules to no longer filter /csg/.<br>/csg/ is one of the most comfy threads on /g/ so I am happy seing it back and you are welcome to rejoin us anon. The more the merrier.

Thus, in 1868, Marx insisted that he could not make do on an annual income of less than \u00a3400-\u00a3500, a phenomenal sum considering that the upper tenth of Englishmen in that period were earning an average income of only \u00a372 a year. Indeed, so profligate was Marx that he quickly ran through an inheritance from a German follower of \u00a3824 in 1864, as well as a gift of \u00a3350 from Engels in the same year.</span><br><br>You can see why losers take after him and his ideology.", "time": 1672659574, "resto": 90653331}, {"no": 90657496, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90655855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90655855</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;while the millions of mindless subhumans vote against them</span><br>2 problems here first<br>representative democracy is a joke  direct democracy is only democracy.

Probably signed with an Intel key. It&#039;s unlikely that this is ever replaced by something open source. Firmware that runs on an ARC core inside the chipset. It runs entirely out-of-band with the main CPU. It has DMA access to the entire system memory (can also override IOMMU) and can access the networking adapters in a way transparent to the OS (separate MAC and IP).</span><br>https://www.coreboot.org/Binary_sit<wbr>uation", "filename": "1637200752480", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 320, "h": 324, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672692772169945, "time": 1672692772, "md5": "sM5ZhG8jUlX5FwTyHVeKpg==", "fsize": 27050, "resto": 90663611}, {"no": 90665236, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:59:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90664886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90664886</a><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof<wbr>_of_impossibility", "time": 1672693188, "resto": 90663611}, {"no": 90665240, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:00:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90664274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90664274</a><br>please see the attached pic for proof, trust the science, goy.", "filename": "1663165629193", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1845, "h": 1923, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672693203812130, "time": 1672693203, "md5": "G4HTFxT6/dqFfmCPRwqvHQ==", "fsize": 1309971, "resto": 90663611}, {"no": 90665294, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90664274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90664274</a><br>The concern isn&#039;t IME phoning home, it&#039;s that if a hacker is ever able to crack it, there&#039;s the potential to compromise millions of machines before the exploit is identified, and every single infected CPU will become trash.

In my professional career I have never used frameworks. Partly cuz it wasn&#039;t up to me, but at the same time I never felt the (real) need to use one. If you keep on working a project as the complexity of it increases after a certain point you end up with your own framework of sorts (for better or worse). I know basic laravel and sf, but I just don&#039;t use them for my own project. In that kinda scope I&#039;m usually more into the learning aspect and making my own stuff from scratch. I expect all the &quot;experienced&quot; coders jumping in now and saying &quot;you think you are better than the whole xy team and you can do it better? you are putting a huge risk factor in your app or something&quot;, but I dismiss that. It is possible to write quality code from scratch. At one time this whole thing was about making stuff from scratch. And who says I can&#039;t take inspiration from those teams&#039; efforts/code? Sometimes I end up with solutions I prefer a lot more to whatever x framework has to offer, other times I have to throw it in the garbage after y amount of hours I sunk into it. But at work, if they tell me we are going to move on with frameworks from now on I will accept it and move on, maybe I&#039;ll learn a thing or two I didn&#039;t know before. Also as a sidenote after working on nodejs project I became to despise frameworks/modules/packages. Obviously not all, I use JWT, phpredis and other shit all the time that fall into the category of the &quot;shouldn&#039;t reinvent the wheel&quot;, but I&#039;m really against using them for simple stuff.

The four biggest weakness of current Linux distros (imo) are:<br>1. No reliable GUI store front-end for installing applications that works across distros. Flatpak comes close but still inadequate. Anything else is just distro-dependant (synaptic, pamac, octopi), or just conveniently wrap the CLI package manager. Normies think of software, not packages, and Linux must adapt to this.<br>2. Terrible backwards compatibility, although I&#039;m not sure how to fix this. Windows seem to work flawlessly with older/modded software, while on Linux it&#039;s almost impossible without manual intervention. Installing anything on Linux potentially breaks the whole system, unlike in Windows.<br>3. Fragmentation, although there is nothing we can do about this due the FOSS nature. What we can do is further standardization and streamlining of installers, desktop environments, and critical programs that can work across distros. Should have designed a single (one) flagship distro that &quot;just werks&quot;. Ubuntu is the current leading contender, yet it is still inadequate.<br>4. OEM install.
