Whatever is in &quot;\\\\&quot; will have it&#039;s emphasis negated.  lyn_\\(fire_emblem\\). Now Fire Emblem is no longer emphasized. So each word in the tag now has an equal amount of weight (impact) on the prompt", "time": 1672309245, "resto": 90581283}, {"no": 90581352, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:20:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90581333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90581333</a><br>gentlemen.", "time": 1672309251, "resto": 90581283}, {"no": 90581363, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:21:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This came out pretty ok", "filename": "01336-2251049601.0-2girls wearing mechanical exoskeletons, overgrown ruins of kowloon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1664, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1672309299556664, "time": 1672309299, "md5": "qaN/YUyS5iVgQim71kPeVg==", "fsize": 563688, "resto": 90581283}, {"no": 90581364, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:21:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90581344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90581344</a><br>i dont get this meme", "time": 1672309302, "resto": 90581283}, {"no": 90581369, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:21:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90581347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90581347</a><br>Same prompt but with anythingV3", "filename": "00114-2632328475-shantae, half-genie, red clothes, belly dancer clothes, long hair, high ponytail, bangs,  purple hair, sharp ears, wide hips, sm", "ext": ".png", "w": 976, "h": 976, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672309311777381, "time": 1672309311, "md5": "GKSFaU45DyBhu5Xji9POdw==", "fsize": 931209, "resto": 90581283}, {"no": 90581373, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)05:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I changed the Knight prompt, again.<br>Dark Souls, masterpiece, best quality, absurdres, intricately designed, extremely detailed CG unity 8k wallpaper,<br>dramatic lighting,<br>(colorful:1.2),<br>(aerial view:0.9),<br>(action, violence), blood, fire, dust, explosion, smoke,<br>(massive medieval fantasy (armies with futuristic medieval helmets) in battle, (hundreds of knights fighting), holding_weapon, holding_sword, holding_gun, army, war, gothic, horror, gritty,<br>(archangel descending from the sky onto the battlefield), (wings made of fire), armor, valkyrie helmet,<br>(realistic lithogram by John William Waterhouse and studio wit and Frank Frazetta)<br><br>I&#039;ve also found that subbing &quot;Dark Souls&quot;

If defects are listed, then sure, it&#039;s not his fault and it&#039;s on you, but I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t list defects and the images showed only the best of the best figures (as they tend to do).<br><br>Here the seller sold you something at subpar quality, as you wouldn&#039;t have complained if it was in decent quality. It is his responsibility to ensure his customers receive the quality that he has written into the product description and conveyed through images. How else is a customer supposed to decide if he wants a product? You can&#039;t fly quickly over to China and take a look at them in person now can you? If he sends out subpar quality products contrary to the product listing, then he has to give you a replacement without these defects or give you a discount for subpar quality products. How he deals with the manufacturer selling shit products to him is entirely his problem.<br><br>Again, it&#039;s not your problem. It&#039;s his problem, that&#039;s why he takes a cut every sale, to deal with shit like this, it&#039;s all part of buying and selling products.", "filename": "1672028156620491", "ext": ".png", "w": 450, "h": 443, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1672057767262117, "time": 1672057767, "md5": "C0+9CaNv19Ffi3pvZk3eyg==", "fsize": 104114, "resto": 90527768}, {"no": 90528822, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)07:45:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When do sales happen?<br><br>I want to buy a Ryzen Pro CPU, but the discount coupons I received didn&#039;t work and contacting AliExpress support was useless.

The short version is: Cheap servos work really well, unless you need torque. They have plastic gearing inside and will not provide as much force as some applications need. They are also have some quirks, some are the usual servo ones (limited range of mobility, usually 180\u00b0, not relevant for your usecase), but cheaper ones may have a minimum angle of movement (think of it like a deadzone on a controller) and some will move a little upon powerup. Also they have limited resolution, which should be expected. <br>You can always increase resolution in exchange for torque with gearing, but making gears so small is hard, and making them bigger means a bigger machine/robot. <br>The two positives: They are really cheap and you don&#039;t need a &quot;controller&quot;. The controller is part of the motor, meaning you give it a angle it should reach by providing a pulse of a specific length, so all you need is a chip that can provide a accurate pulse. Any arduino nano can do that, so the &quot;controller&quot; part will cost you 2-4$. Use a ESP8266 if you don&#039;t want to have to use serial connection with a wire. <br><br>Given how cheap those parts are, you can test a ultra cheap prototype (with just one hand of servos) for maybe 15$ or something, barely any risk. If you want to use higher quality motors, prices will be higher. <br><br><a href=\"#p90542278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90542278</a><br>They stopped doing that as much, at least for me.

Where I live (germany), usually raspberry Pis are the best price performance for their specific power. I got my zeros for 5.5\u20ac (for the non wireless) and 8\u20ac for the wireless versions. Finding them in stock is not exactly easy, but they are pretty good for what they cost.<br><br>There&#039;s plenty of alternatives, but sadly not really in the lower price segments. Most SBCs seem to try to fix the issue of &quot;I want a SBC, but the Pi doesn&#039;t have enough power&quot; rather than &quot;I want a SBC for very little money to do basic tasks&quot;. Most people (and this applies to microcontrollers as well) seem to overshoot their requirements and get 5 times as much performance as they need. <br>So to give you better advice we should know what it is you plan to do/use it for (maybe a microcontroller is enough?)<br><br>Because I don&#039;t need more power than a pi4 (actually even that&#039;s overkill so I never got one), I&#039;m not too familiar with the alternatives, but some worth considering (look into it yourself) are:<br>Pocket Beagle, AML-S905X-CC (&quot;Le potato&quot; I wish I was joking), Banana Pi and Orange Pi.", "time": 1672306728, "resto": 90527768}, {"no": 90580894, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:40:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Updated guide<br>specifically the misc tools section is now IT Technician tools and includes Pi-KVM and GPD Pocked PC with KVM functionality. if anyone can think of anything extra pls add since I&#039;m interested in this stuff :^)<br><br>I think next I&#039;ll add in a section for handheld gaming/emulation devices.

Here are some more comprehensive tips for forum users to keep in mind when trying to identify machine-generated text through style analysis:<br><br>Look for unusual or repetitive phrasing: Machine-generated text often lacks the natural variation and nuance of human writing, and may include repetitive or formulaic phrasing. For example, you might notice that a message uses the same phrase or construction multiple times in a row, or that it uses words or phrases that are uncommon or out of place in the context.<br><br>Check for unnatural tone: Machine-generated text may have an unnatural or flat tone, or may use inappropriate or inconsistent language for the context. For example, you might notice that a message has an overly formal or casual tone, or that it uses language that seems out of character for the person who is supposedly writing it.<br><br>Watch for deviation from typical human writing style: Machine-generated text may deviate from typical human writing style in terms of things like word choice, sentence structure, and paragraph organization. For example, you might notice that a message uses unusual or uncommon words, or that it has a choppy or disjointed structure.<br><br>Look for inconsistencies in the text: Machine-generated text may contain inconsistencies or implausibilities that would be unlikely to occur in human writing. For example, you might notice that a message contradicts itself or contains information that is not supported by the rest of the text.<br><br>Consider the context: When trying to identify machine-generated text, it is important to consider the context in which it appears. For example, if a message is posted in a forum about a technical topic, you might expect to see language that is more technical and specific, whereas a message posted in a casual or social forum might be more casual and colloquial.", "time": 1672314966, "resto": 90582061}, {"no": 90582334, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)06:58:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90582061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90582061</a><br>so many bots", "time": 1672315085, "resto": 90582061}, {"no": 90582378, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)07:01:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In this paper, we will explore the use of GPT-3 prompts as a method for generating human-like forum posts.<br><br>Methods:<br><br>Using GPT-3 to generate a list of possible responses: One method of generating human-like forum posts is to use GPT-3 to generate a list of possible responses to a given prompt.

The responses generated by GPT-3 can then be reviewed and edited by a human to ensure that they are appropriate and coherent.<br><br>Using GPT-3 to generate complete forum posts: Another method of generating human-like forum posts is to use GPT-3 to generate complete forum posts.

The generated post can then be reviewed and edited by a human to ensure that it is appropriate and coherent.<br><br>Using GPT-3 to generate forum posts in a specific style or tone: In addition to generating forum posts on a specific topic, GPT-3 can also be used to generate forum posts in a specific style or tone. This can be achieved by providing the GPT-3 model with a prompt that describes the desired style or tone and asking it to generate a forum post on the topic.<br><br>Using GPT-3 to generate forum posts with specific formatting: GPT-3 can also be used to generate forum posts with specific formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists.

To make it make sense to build larger cells, you need a really huge number of those larger cells, and it&#039;s still going to take time to pay off.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;noticing D cells are better value than AA cells is like inventing a warp drive</span><br>Sure thing, chum.", "time": 1672297640, "resto": 90577539}, {"no": 90579333, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:07:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve been reading about fantastic problem solving battery chemistries for nearly 30 years.<br>Restructuring a L-Ion is not an achievement.<br>A battery mix that has 4 times the energy density, while being (just as) easy to make, while using just as abundant materials is an achievement.<br><br>Making a fuckbig 18650 a&#039;la Tesla isn&#039;t real progress.", "time": 1672297673, "resto": 90577539}, {"no": 90579367, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:10:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90578942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90578942</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is probably not more than another 2X or 3X improvement even possible.</span><br>We really need a new technology.", "time": 1672297829, "resto": 90577539}, {"no": 90579451, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90579300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90579300</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AGM</span><br>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RFXHY<wbr>K<br>64 lb<br>~300 charge cycles<br>$200<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lithium</span><br>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S1QCK9<wbr>4<br>24 lb<br>~2000-5000 charge cycles<br>$300<br><br><br>AGM gives you ~1.2 kWh x 300 = 360 kWh of use<br>LFP gives you ~1.2 kWh x 3000 =  3600 kWh of use<br><br>To convert that into car terms.

There are plenty of artists and people asking for commissions of artists outside only to then post their commissions on the server as if they made it instead of the artist. I asked there if anybody saw any dip in commissions, none of them saw any significant dip. Coomer Patreon still has not dipped at all if you look at graphtreon.com. You look at average coomer artists and it didn&#039;t go down, you look at the 20 top patreon accounts that do coomer drawings, and they are either not going down, or they are going down, but the going down has been trends long since AI arrived. Basically AI had no effect on them. Even on /ic/ where there it is filled with luddites and schizos panicking about AI, when you actually ask them about commissions none of them had any downturns. Well, one category had downturn, and that is DnD commissions. For some reason AI which cannot do any fantasy creature designs that are not extremely generic (orc, goblin, human with pig head, unicorn) is also driving this market down. <br>Even if you look at the luddite leaders like RJ Palmer or Stephan Zapata, they are both non-coomer artists both making random creative creature designs, or at least Zapata is. Zapata makes creatures AI will be able to do maybe in like 5 months, and only Midjurney type AIs that fiddle a lot with your prompts. RJ Palmer makes primarily realistic looking Pokemons and dragons with very high detail and skill. <br>Most of the luddites are not people actually affected by it at the moment.

It would have to be, because JavaScript doesn&#039;t have access to the system<br>- NPM was so popular that it got ported over to be a package manager for vanilla JavaScript, though. 99% of people just use NPM for vanilla JavaScript<br>- When used for vanilla JavaScript, NPM is both a &quot;build system&quot; and a &quot;package manager&quot;. When used as a package manager, it strictly regards NodeJS, because JavaScript cannot run on the command line. When used as a build system, it regards that project specifically<br>- NPM is a build system but it has no way to... load the files. For that you need a &quot;bundler&quot;<br>- The command &quot;NPM install&quot; has two different... contexts. One offers the convenience of updating what&#039;s basically a &quot;Makefile&quot; and the other gets these dependencies that are specified in the makefile.<br>- Neither of these two &quot;contexts&quot; &quot;install&quot; anything.

Mergerfs just makes data from multiple directories (where you have drives mounted) appear in one directory, thus providing the capacity pooling feature of RAID. Snapraid enables &quot;partial backups&quot; in a way that essentially lets you lose any of drives (up to n drives, where n = count of parity drives) and later be able to rebuild lost data using remaining drives. That provides something very similar to redundancy of RAID.<br>There are downsides - you don&#039;t get any performance increase (in general) compared to using just one drive, and the parity needs to be updated on schedule, it&#039;s not realtime. So it makes sense for data that doesn&#039;t change very often, like movies or TV. Although I&#039;ve successfully used it for a long time with even something like Nextcloud, but if I lost a drive, I&#039;d be able to recreate data to the state it was last night, since I had nightly parity syncs.<br>Unraid is a proprietary distro + storage stack that somehow achieves almost the same benefits (flexible expansion) and also has realtime parity. But it&#039;s paid, proprietary (vendor lockin) and at least according to Snapraid comparison page which admittedly might be a bit biases, Unraid doesn&#039;t care about bitrot or something and just overwrites parity.<br><a href=\"#p90556474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90556474</a><br>I don&#039;t.<br><a href=\"#p90556510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90556510</a><br>Minecraft likes fast single core.<br><a href=\"#p90556913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90556913</a><br>Good summary.<br><a href=\"#p90557078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90557078</a><br>Wireguard kinda feels like a mesh VPN protocol from the start.

This immediately fell victim to the lisp curse, which is another way of saying &quot;now you have two problems.&quot; Instead of having to understand the program like in C, you need to understand a domain specific language written in LISP and then understand the program written in it. LISP is the wall, it brings the abstraction to a high enough level that it crumbles onto itself.<br><br>In the end, your new language will either be another LISP or another C.
