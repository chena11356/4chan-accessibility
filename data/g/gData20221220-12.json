And I had this online personality of, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 but I actually did.

She borrowed novels from the library and read them alone in the park. She started admiring graffiti when she rode the subway, then fell in with some teens who taught her how to spray-paint in a freight train yard in Queens. And she began waking up without an alarm clock at 7 a.m., no longer falling asleep to the glow of her phone at midnight. Once, as she later wrote in a text titled the \u201cLuddite Manifesto,\u201d she fantasized about tossing her iPhone into the Gowanus Canal.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; While Logan\u2019s parents appreciated her metamorphosis, particularly that she was regularly coming home for dinner to recount her wanderings, they grew distressed that they couldn\u2019t check in on their daughter on a Friday night. And after she conveniently lost the smartphone they had asked her to take to Paris for a summer abroad program, they were distraught. Eventually, they insisted that she at least start carrying a flip phone.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; At an all-ages punk show, she met a teen with a flip phone, and they bonded over their worldview. \u201cShe was just a freshman, and I couldn\u2019t believe how well read she was,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe walked in the park with apple cider and doughnuts and shared our Luddite experiences.

But a note of tension seemed to form in the air when the topic of college admissions came up. The club members exchanged updates about the schools they had applied to across the country. Odille reported getting into the State University of New York at Purchase. \u201cYou could totally start a Luddite Club there, I bet,\u201d said Elena Scherer, a Murrow senior. Taking a shortcut, they headed down a lonely path that had no park lamps. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Their talk livened when they discussed the poetry of Lewis Carroll, the piano compositions of Ravel and the evils of TikTok. Elena pointed at the night sky.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a waxing gibbous.

The old piece of shit was made from cloth and plastic and cost 20\u20ac. This wallet is made from aluminium, decently machined, holds 8 cards (+ 2 paperthin cards, but together they amount to maybe half a card in thickness) and has a small lever on the bottom that when pulled makes the cards fan out of it for easy access. I don&#039;t think it would work well with more than 9 cards, but it does work with less cards if needed. On the back there&#039;s a soft stretchy fabric pouch for coins or (in my case) paper money.

It was a plastic christmas tree that would light up and play sounds when someone walked by (with a ultrasonic sensor, mp3 module, speaker and lights). I programmed it to swear at people and left it at a local mall, sitting in a nearby cafe with some friends and laughing at the people&#039;s reactions. <br>But I mostly use ESP8266 modules, and want to get into designing pcbs and not using devboards anymore for my current projects. The ones with an arduino built in are only:<br>- Monitoring the soil moisture of my balcony plants and watering them as needed, while also logging the data<br>- A analog clock that, if music is played on my computer, displays the progress of the song with the hour hand instead of the time. Once the music is over it goes back to displaying the time.<br><br>With a esp8266 I motorized my coffee handgrinder, it checks if I am at home (if my phone is in my home network) each morning, then grinds coffee for me so it&#039;s fresh when I wake up. I can also tell it to make more or less coffee etc. <br>I built a cocktail machine with a Rpi zero that makes cocktails, but it broke and I haven&#039;t sat down to fix it yet.<br>Current project is a watch with built in alarm function. 5 minutes before the alarm it vibrates lightly and if I don&#039;t wake up and stop it it gives me an electro shock 1 minute before the alarm.

wanted out of it. linux support in some respects (sleep being the big one) could be better, but that&#039;s more of an intel being shit issue. if you do buy one, whatever you do, don&#039;t fucking download the images from their site. i hear the isos have malware on them, and the ubuntu mate image i got was not only old as fuck, but ugly as sin and didn&#039;t even work right with the screen. i ended up just doing a normal archinstall with gnome, btrfs, and the random shit needed to make gnome autorotate correctly.<br>as far as windows goes, it&#039;s fine. no real problems and it just werks

Images and text are about as simple as it gets for AI to understand what is going on. Making AI understand context in the text is getting better, but still sucks, and million other professions are clinging to this strand of hair. Videos are harder, and the current versions made by Google are still fucking miserable and won\u2019t just magically improve as easily. You might look at them and say how good they look, but they implement the same tech as image generators, which are already nearly perfect, meaning that unless you look at the correct parts it might look impressive. The videos still morph legs together, swap them when walking, create artefact every time something touches something and so on, which are the key things in a video that separate it from pictures. Now imagine games that have to be coded bugs-free, have to be cohesive, have to have story and be fun to play and playable. AI will have to figure out how to play test every kind of game out there, learn how to make it fun and also learn how to write long code projects. All of these roadblocks if removed and passed over would mean removal of like half our current jobs. And not to even mention that the training of those models with human feedback would be fucking impossible. Good gameplay is more subjective then different artstyles, where one gameplay can be masterpiece to some and the worst thing to another, unlike with pictures where good shading and no technical errors automatically make the picture 5+/10. Recognising if picture is shit takes you 0.5 seconds and 2 seconds to see if it is great, cans say the same for games.

Most &quot;art&quot; jobs are just producing generic soulless corporate art. Those jobs are gone, for good. But the &quot;artists&quot; working those jobs are talentless hacks who are most likely diversity picks in the first place so probably have job security in that aspect. AI art doesn&#039;t need to produce super unique high detained and anatomically correct artwork to steal &gt;90% of art jobs, it literally just needs to produce shit like pic related on a consistent scale to do that (and it already does).<br><br>Artists are honestly shitting their pants over nothing. If you&#039;re good at art, like actually fucking talented and creative, you&#039;ll be fine. The AI is good but can&#039;t read your fucking mind, you&#039;re still going to have unique and creative ideas, styles, and compositions that can&#039;t be accurately mirrored by the AI even if they trained it on all of your artwork because your neurons are fucking unique to you. BUT if you&#039;re a talentless piece of shit who makes their living off generic copypasta coombait style art that you can shit out every week for your diaper furry patreons, then you may have a difficult time combatting the fact that your generic ass soulless style can be replicated pretty well by AI. Use this as a moment to improve your craft, or at the very least just utilize AI yourself to streamline your workflow similar to how premade brushes/effects streamlined your workflow (which were equally met with discontent when introduced but now everyone just uses them without any fucking complaints).<br><br>Final thought - AI is good but your average boomer CEO who doesn&#039;t even know how to Google simple ass questions like &quot;how to color excel cells below 50% red&quot; isn&#039;t going to know how to fucking prompt nor have the creative insight to curate + fine tune + modify the outputs for the best results.

You&#039;d have to be a moron to not see it for what it is.

Reuters then asked two independent cyber analysts \u2013 Bill Marczak of University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, and Zach Edwards of Victory Medium \u2013 to probe how Iran may have used weaknesses in the CIA\u2019s own technology to unmask Hosseini and other CIA informants. The two are experts on privacy and cybersecurity, with experience analyzing electronic intelligence operations. The effort represents the first independent technical analysis of the intelligence failure.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marczak and Edwards quickly discovered that the secret messaging window hidden inside Iraniangoals.com could be spotted by simply right-clicking on the page to bring up the website\u2019s coding. This code contained descriptions of secret functions, including the words \u201cmessage\u201d and \u201ccompose\u201d \u2013 easily found clues that a messaging capability had been built into the site. The coding for the search bar that triggered the secret messaging software was labeled \u201cpassword.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Far from being customized, high-end spycraft, Iraniangoals.com was one of hundreds of websites mass-produced by the CIA to give to its sources, the independent analysts concluded. These rudimentary sites were devoted to topics such as beauty, fitness and entertainment, among them a Star Wars fan page and another for the late American talk show host Johnny Carson.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Each fake website was assigned to only one spy in order to limit exposure of the entire network in case any single agent was captured, two former CIA officials told Reuters.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But the CIA made identifying those sites easy, the independent analysts said. Marczak located more than 350 websites containing the same secret messaging system, all of which have been offline for at least nine years and archived.

They touch literally every polo, unfolding everything to inspect that yes it is in fact a polo. Following the man is a wife who is used as the source of credit pulls by the man at every store. He has his wife sign up for every single credit card. Behind her is the grandfather who walks with his hands clasped behind his back, walking aimlessly. Behind him is the pack of children, running amok unsupervised. The man may or may not have a boyfriend/emotional support guy with him as well. The pair will inspect polos together throughout every store then read the price on every item. After reading the price they will ask you what the final price of this item is. If the item is on sale and they were attracted by this sale, you will do the math of 25% off of a $50 polo makes $37.50. He will not reply. He will then walk directly to the clearance section to search for polos. Upon finding a clearance polo he will read the price then approach and ask you what the final price is. The clearance price will be $19.99 with 25% off. You will inform him it is therefore about $15. He will consider this and look at the logo, rubbing the logo. He wants the logo on his polo but is unsure of the price. He will ask if there is a further discount if his wife applies for a store credit card. Yes sir, another 20% off. He will ask you the final price. About $11, sir. He has his wife sign up for a credit card for him, she does not speak. The children play hide and seek as the old man walks with his hands clasped behind his back looking up at the lights. The boyfriend inspects himself in every pair of womens sunglasses. The credit pull works and the card is charged $11 for the logo polo. And the tribe of indians leave the store. Before the younger patriarch goes with his banana yellow and lime green striped logo polo goes, you tell him. You say, sir!

They touch literally every polo, unfolding everything to inspect that yes it is in fact a polo. Following the man is a wife who is used as the source of credit pulls by the man at every store. He has his wife sign up for every single credit card. Behind her is the grandpa who walks with his hands clasped behind his back, walking aimlessly. Behind him is the pack of children, running amok unsupervised. The man may or may not have a boyfriend emotional support guy with him as well. The pair will inspect polos together throughout every store then read the price on every item. After reading the price they will ask you what the final price of this item is. If the item is on sale and they were attracted by this sale, you will do the math of 25% off of a $50 polo makes $37. He will not reply. He will then walk directly to the clearance section to search for polos. Upon finding a clearance polo he will read the price then approach and ask you what the final price is. The clearance price will be $19 with 25% off. You will inform him it is therefore about $15. He will consider this and look at the logo, rubbing the logo. He wants the logo on his polo but is unsure of the price. He will ask if there is a further discount if his wife applies for a store credit card. Yes sir, another 20% off. He will ask you the final price. About 11, sir. He has his wife sign up for a credit card for him, she does not speak. The children play hide and seek as the old man walks with his hands clasped behind his back looking up at the lights. The boyfriend inspects himself in every pair of womens sunglasses. The credit pull works and the card is charged $11 for the logo polo. And the tribe of indians leave the store. Before the younger patriarch goes with his banana yellow and lime green striped logo polo goes, you tell him. You say, sir!
