The first is the risk of scratching up the lenses beyond repair. This happens the moment you have the cleaner running and allow the lenses to touch the walls of the cleaner, or when you have other loose items or hard debris in it. These scratches happen near instantly and pretty much can&#039;t be fixed. The second issue comes from using aggressive cleaning solutions which eat away at coatings, glues or acrylic frames. Mild hand soap is about as harsh you want to go for regular cleaning, diluted blue spirits is what opticians use but should never be used regulary as it will eat away at coatings. But all of this is assuming you&#039;re buying a proper ultrasonic cleaner, and not some bullshit Chinese plastic tub with a N64 rumble pack pressed against it.<br><br>Personally I just use tap water to rinse of dirt and a clean microfiber cloth for my daily cleaning. If that&#039;s not enough I&#039;ll use a Zeiss wet wipe or blue spirits diluted with demineralised water if things are really bad.

For this build I used DSPIAE nippers, Revell needle tip plastic cement, Olfa hobby knife blades, and black and brown Gundam panel liners.<br><br>Included in the box are runners made of quality hard plastics that don&#039;t get stress marks easily, multiple sets of 1x2mm water slide decals for the eyes, and the build manual. The build itself was straightforward with clear 3D lined instructions. You start with the core/inner frame, but just like with the robomaid Yui kit you have to disassemble the head and forearms and replace them with the actual armored pieces. I simply skipped those parts of the core to save time. All pieces are snap-on or slide-in, but some smaller pieces such as the red pearl, thighs and sphinx&#039;s beard fall off easily during handling. You can be patient and keep reattaching those items or just glue them in place like I did.<br><br>Articulation is surprisingly nice. There are ball joints in the head, lower back, upper legs, shoulders, feet and hands. The knees are double jointed allowing for a full 180 bend. The elbows are basic hinge joints. Finally there are also swivel joints in the the upper arms and upper legs allowing for rotation on top of the ball joint movement.<br><br>In terms of accessories you get a floor and a backdrop, a throne, 3 weapons, wings for Esis which you can also fold up and attach to the throne, and a transformable sphinx/sarcophagus. You can also replace the spinx&#039;s head with the upper torso of Esis if that&#039;s your thing. The floor and backdrop can be reversed with one side being robo-egyptian themed and the other being the default style from the other Fiftyseven kits. All in all, I&#039;d say this kit was definitely worth it despite it&#039;s small size. The robomaid Yui kit felt lackluster as it focused more on clothing options, where this Esis focuses more on aesthetics and accessories.<br><br>8/10, can&#039;t wait to see what robowaifu they release next.", "filename": "esis", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674676266388480, "time": 1674676266, "md5": "HKkMg/w8sPHByK1J0PkAzA==", "fsize": 317682, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91119066, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:10:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "there&#039;s no way i get memed with the vat, right?", "time": 1674681035, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91119909, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:50:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91117559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91117559</a><br>Is the color really this different?

Often these cuts will be barely visible, if visible at all. To achieve a perfect cut you want to cut each part twice. The first cut 2mm away from the part, the second flush to the part. This greatly reduces the risk of getting stress marks (ie plastic turning white) and nubs (remaining pieces of runner on part).<br><br>Hobby knives are mostly just nice to have to clean up cuts gone wrong or remove accidental nubs. Any cheap set will do, I just prefer Olfa blades as they are sharp as fuck and hold their edge.<br><br>Plastic cement is not required to build this kit. I just didn&#039;t had the patience to deal with the parts that repeatedly came off and already had it laying around from previous builds.<br><br>Panel liners are an easy way of adding depth and shadows to parts by tracing edges and grooves and then wiping off excess ink. The effect is pretty noticeable when you compare the pictures. Fineliners and pencils can achieve a similar effect but don&#039;t play nice with all plastics so do try it on a spare part or on the inside of a part.<br><br>In the end it&#039;s all up to you and how far you want to take things. I too once started with nail clippers and slowly purchased nicer tools and new techniques as I got more into model kits and started buying expensive kits. But if I had to recommend one item if you intend on building more kits, it would definitely be the nippers.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mine arrived but i&#039;m waiting for the weekend so i can do it in peace, once again...</span><br>Enjoy your build anon!", "time": 1674689106, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91123414, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "chink shit", "time": 1674694490, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91123596, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:08:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91092189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91092189</a><br>I\u2019ve had these pedals for a few months and they seem to be holding up alright. <br>https://a.aliexpress.com/_mswoNRu", "filename": "9F22C73D-DB3D-420B-BD41-769203CC7DEA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674695323466058, "time": 1674695323, "md5": "ocZxITnKZQbbkoq7MsfQZg==", "fsize": 265979, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91124203, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:51:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91123414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91123414</a><br>General", "time": 1674697906, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91124641, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)21:19:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91121863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91121863</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For me neither has warranty</span><br>Even on Amazon?<br>I find Amazon chink sellers are way more willing to help when shit goes wrong.

Why? Women (or lack therefore).<br><br>Allow me to elaborate. Men (both single men and men in relationship) are instinctively CRUEL to other men in the presence of women*. If you think make to highschool or anytime where you had a friend circle you&#039;ll recall just how vicious and unreliable other men become when there is a woman around. <br><br>The hypothesis being that, when there is a woman present, men will naturally try to establish a pecking order among themselves so as to signal to the female(s) present who is most fit for mating. <br><br>Men literally don&#039;t do this when there are no women around. You&#039;ll notice that, while men can be petty at time, for the most part an all male workplace is very chill. Men show up, do their jobs, say little, maybe tell a couple of jokes in the break room and return to work. Men are task driven and don&#039;t care much for superficial social interactions. <br><br>When you&#039;re a sperg you&#039;re an easy target and even low ranking males will viciously turn on you to demonstrate to the women present that they are in fact socially dominant. The worst offenders of this are low ranking males (basedboys) because they are otherwise unmasculine, therefore a sperg is a great target for them. <br><br>The more women (and the prettier they are) in your workplace the more harsh the other males will treat you. But tech generally has fewer (and uglier) women and therefore it&#039;s possible to just keep your head down, work hard, and not be cruelly sabotaged by other men.<br><br>So I know that isn&#039;t directly answer your question but the tl;dr is:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all jobs require socializing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;men typically keep socializing to-the-point and impersonal</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;men only become petty and vicious when women are around</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tech has few women</span><br><br>Your best bet is to overcome your social anxiety anon, but in the absense of that yes, coding is good place to be if you&#039;re not socially savvy due to the absence of women.", "time": 1674726117, "resto": 91129686}, {"no": 91130122, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:43:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Got an offer of \u00a380k, currently on \u00a350k.

For example, each object has complete control over their own rendering, but they receive RELATIVE coordinates and dimensions from their parent window lens. So say an image editor wants to display itself fullscreen, if it&#039;s a child of the current screen object then it takes up the entire monitor, but if it&#039;s a child of another smaller window object then it just takes up the whole area of that smaller window. In other words, divs and CSS, but dynamic.</span><br>In more detail, the lens/head editor decides what information to give to the children and what limits to set on them before they&#039;re allowed to render themselves. This can range from a hint &quot;try to be less than 300px wide&quot; to a hard limit &quot;I&#039;ll only render 300px wide screens&quot;. Have the parent and children communicate with each other to decide how they&#039;re all going to share space.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mean you need a screen/frame/window editor for a proper editing program anyway, might as well go full generic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally I&#039;d go for a graph instead of a tree, so whatever the currently selected node is is the &quot;head&quot; and all it&#039;s neighbors are children. &quot;Descending&quot; the tree actually rotates it and the old head is now a child of the new head, which is free to display it as any other child or as a special case to emulate a tree. The reason to do that is to avoid window jiggering and layout multiplying, since with a directed graph you can &quot;swap layouts&quot;, &quot;rotate&quot; through windows, etc...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And also a directed graph is literally hypertext so that plus the divs and layout editor is just DNS+HTML+CSS+JS all in pure CL.</span><br>yes, his description kind of sounds like ReactJS, but using Prototype-based programming instead of Hooks or normal OO-classes, let&#039;s see what comes out of that...", "time": 1674721711, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91129298, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:29:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91129285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91129285</a><br>sorry, the text on top should be all quoted, not one line unquoted", "time": 1674721787, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91129928, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:27:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "emac man", "filename": "unknown-24", "ext": ".png", "w": 997, "h": 901, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1674725261949786, "time": 1674725261, "md5": "VFZfx9D2mAvd4V6lC76YOA==", "fsize": 1529457, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91130146, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:46:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;another attempt to go back to emacs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need to use windows tho</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wsl so I don&#039;t have to deal with compatibility issues</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spacemacs for good docs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good performance as well</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very motivated this time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cut through evil tutor like it&#039;s butter</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;add lsp-mode and typescript layer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;navigate to project, gets recognized immediately cause git</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;typescript so lsp kicks in and offers to install eslint automatically</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is amazing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lel invalid string argument nil</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtf.jpg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh, right, eslint is an node thing, it probably needs a node environment and npm for this, my bad</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;install it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;same error message</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well, gonna try the windows one I guess</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too many files open</span><br>COME ON.<br>This has been such an amazing experience.

My old policy was to turn a blind eye, but then I talked to someone in the scene and realized that this wouldn&#039;t solve anything - like the ban on politics here, this is to ensure our discussions are kept in good faith, and so the site can develop an organic artist culture.

You can do your trading and research on your broker&#039;s website. Whoever manages the ETFs you pick will have a website with more information than you could ever want. If you&#039;re gonna do a deep-dive I guess you&#039;ll want LibreOffice so you can put stuff in a spreadsheet and maybe make graphs, but to be honest I don&#039;t get that fancy. I look at the prospectus, buy something decently diversified, and then don&#039;t much care about e.g. the price histories of each of the hundred companies in the fund. <br><br>For the ETFs, I used the ishares ones, but lots of companies have them now. Cover the world with equity-income funds (US, international developed, emerging markets). Add some bond ones, preferably US and international. Add a diversified REIT one just to have a different asset class, some of them have a nice yield too. If there&#039;s something else you like you can bolt it on the side. When you have money to put to work (quarterly, annually, whatever) then consider picking something that&#039;s gone down in the past year; less expensive for what you&#039;re getting. And.. that&#039;s pretty much it. Go to sleep, come back quarterly and pick up your distributions. <br><br>This is one of the few fields in which laziness is an advantage. Professionals will probably beat you at day trading, since they&#039;re experienced at it, it&#039;s their job. But they have to worry about how they look at the end of each quarter, you don&#039;t. Most Wall Street traders can&#039;t just buy something boring and sit on it for a decade while it slowly creeps up and coughs up dividends, their boss will ask them why he&#039;s paying them if that&#039;s all they do.

Non-exhaustive, but common ones are.<br><br>1. US Law: It&#039;s very literal and you can&#039;t have anyone use &quot;good reason&quot; to suggest maybe using an alternative. Some earlier laws are so literal, it may actually state the technology, application, or even fucking language/version (build this thing, and it can only run on Java 6).<br>2.Unions/Boomers: You&#039;ll end up with boomers that refuse to modernize and want to do things the way they always did it when they started the job. That&#039;s how you end up with high schools where one boomer teacher still has their trackball mouse, using an overhead projector and rolls in the giant CRT TV hooked up to a VHS player in 2023.<br>3. Regulations: Can be law or industry specific. In the US, we have insane privacy laws that make handling of medical shit near impossible and insane hoops to jump through. As a result, shit that broke through the regulations to be used at the time isn&#039;t upgraded. How you end up with 20-25 year old software and terribly non-modern protocols. For example, I needed to give my doctor a document today. I can&#039;t email him, only use some shitty web portal system that doesn&#039;t do attachments.

There&#039;s a difference between paying money back and paying money back with interest. Since the establishment of the Federal Reserve every dollar the US govt has &quot;printed&quot; has been created bearing interest and paid back with it. As the book mentioned <a href=\"#p91127019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91127019</a> This is a very recent phenomenon and until recently countries just paid their debts at face value with no interest. This alienates a massive amount of tax burdens because say the government prints $300 million to build the Hoover damn. They $300 million worth of economic activity has been done and that amount is paid back later. Whereas with interest bearing notes from the Federal Reserve, that original $300 million winds up being paid back with $350 million and that extra $50 million was not injected into the economy, so on that project alone the economy would shrink by $50 million. <br><br>A good example of an interest free monetary system working is Libya build the largest irrigation project in the world without taking out any loans from (((international))) banks or from other countries.

That&#039;s right, pretty girl, I am not a good person. I hurt women. I ruin days. Think of all the fun we could have had had I not punched you. Continued to talk, joke, walk, have a good time through and through. You would go home happy and develop a positive sentiment towards me. You&#039;d think of me several times per day whenever you experience something you and I both enjoy, or whenever you&#039;re generally happy. That reality is not meant to be. I have to remind you that I am not who I appear to be. All this time it was a mask and now I cast unto you my true face. Oh, you&#039;re crying?! Well then, have another. Does it hurt? What hurts you more - the punch, ruining your perfect face; or the fact that I interrupted your high levels of joy, ruining your perfect streak of happiness. This could have been a boring day, a day you would soon forget because it was like any other. Instead, you will remember this day for a very long time because of what I did to you. You will no longer associate me with good times and laughs, but with tears and pain. What sets apart a tear of joy from a tear of sorrow? Pure context of the situation. You will spill tears of sadness. You will forever be scarred if not on your smooth, beautiful, perfect little face, then inside your brain. Every time you think of me, you will remember that my penultimate intention is to hurt you. I will lure you in with nice things and finish you off with unspeakable acts that leave you in sorrow. I am sorry that I am like this. I have trouble bonding with people. It&#039;s best we part our ways now, I must not get too attached to anybody. I could hurt in worse ways.

It&#039;s nice than my 1080, 24inch in every way.<br>However I&#039;ve noticed an issue with looking at the monitor. Everything is much much smaller while being much bigger. For example the catalog has 14 threads in a row on this monitor, and only 10 on the smaller one. The trade off being the text, pictures, and everything else is much much smaller than they&#039;d be on the smaller monitor.  And for games, (FFXIV in this case) I find essentially no difference between total screen space between the 2 monitors. Like the same amount of space between say the hotbar and the end of the screen, is the same proportionate space between the 2 monitors.<br>So the main question is: how do I combat this, or adjust to this? Do I make my game UI smaller so essentially I have a much bigger field of view, and then the entire ui is much smaller? And in that case, do I.. sit closer to my screen? Currently I&#039;m like 24-30 inches away from my screen. I don&#039;t need to &quot;strain&quot; my eyes to read any text like in this thread for example, but it is almost tedious in a way, compared to the smaller monitor, since it&#039;s all so tiny in comparison. I think my question is more or less a sort of ergonomics thing, as opposed to just finding a personal preference type deal, since I&#039;ve tried some different things but muscle memory is hard to break and I can&#039;t be changing distance, sizes, etc constantly since these things take quite a while to properly get used to in the first place.<br>tldr do I sit closer to bigger monitor with smaller UI/HUD / text. Or do I maintain distance, and make everything larger / zoom in. Or do I literally just keep it small (at 100%, it&#039;s natural size) and learn to play and deal with it.", "time": 1674601768, "resto": 91098374}, {"no": 91101188, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91098650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91098650</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that might work for a HP 15 might not work for a HP pavilion power 15</span><br>Try asking the sellers if it will work, they might know more and it could be fine.
