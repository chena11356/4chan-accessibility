How else is a customer supposed to decide if he wants a product? You can&#039;t fly quickly over to China and take a look at them in person now can you? If he sends out subpar quality products contrary to the product listing, then he has to give you a replacement without these defects or give you a discount for subpar quality products.

The short version is: Cheap servos work really well, unless you need torque. They have plastic gearing inside and will not provide as much force as some applications need. They are also have some quirks, some are the usual servo ones (limited range of mobility, usually 180\u00b0, not relevant for your usecase), but cheaper ones may have a minimum angle of movement (think of it like a deadzone on a controller) and some will move a little upon powerup. Also they have limited resolution, which should be expected. <br>You can always increase resolution in exchange for torque with gearing, but making gears so small is hard, and making them bigger means a bigger machine/robot. <br>The two positives: They are really cheap and you don&#039;t need a &quot;controller&quot;. The controller is part of the motor, meaning you give it a angle it should reach by providing a pulse of a specific length, so all you need is a chip that can provide a accurate pulse. Any arduino nano can do that, so the &quot;controller&quot; part will cost you 2-4$. Use a ESP8266 if you don&#039;t want to have to use serial connection with a wire. <br><br>Given how cheap those parts are, you can test a ultra cheap prototype (with just one hand of servos) for maybe 15$ or something, barely any risk. If you want to use higher quality motors, prices will be higher. <br><br><a href=\"#p90542278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90542278</a><br>They stopped doing that as much, at least for me.

What do I mean when I say dynamism?<br>Moar bass, moar treble, it means the cone/diaphragm actually move back and forth at more distance and also move tiny back and forth at less and very quick distance (high pitch). The problem is deeper diaphragm movement means slower bass perceived in music while the quick back and forths for higher freq tend to appear faster.<br><br>Earphones that have really light cone/diaphragm usually they are carbon fiber (plastic) &quot;aka light carbon diaphragm&quot; dont typically burst like all these &quot;airline free earphones&quot; which use plain plastic or maybe they died from all that cleaning and uv they did (some airlines may actually recycle them).<br><br>Raycons shouldn&#039;t really have bad tuning since sound depends on how you wear them and the wearer. Earphones like these that are too bassy are not bassy to some people.<br>As someone whose ears appear to be parallel to my sides, I never really get midbloat on basshead-tuned iems that graph like bloat. Maybe it&#039;s actually why bassheads prefer basshead tuning, our ears may just be too pulled towards the back that it doesn&#039;t &quot;cup&quot; around the earphone&#039;s tips. It does get midbloat if I push the tips further deep in but I don&#039;t like doing that cause it&#039;s gay and I don&#039;t use flatbass cringe like etymotic.<br><br>I suggest you just get the same shit if you&#039;re used to it or grab the same earphone with the same FR.

measurement (I also verified my measurement to be somewhat similar from the other measurements of IEMs I owned).  <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is this the reason why the flutes(or whatever that is) at 1:36 sounds different?</span><br>if the flute is playing at A6 (1760Hz) the first to sixth harmonic should be somwhat similar on both IEMs (an octave upwards is: harmonic = frequency * nth). it only differs around the 7th harmonic of A6 (if the flute was playing the A6 tone) which is equal to 1760*7 or 12320Hz where both IEMs FR diverge completely upward and downward.<br>this results in different timbre over instruments hitting that harmonic range. though what matters really is does it sound pleasant or not? if you think it should sound louder on that region you should pick the thieaudio or otherwise if not.", "time": 1672059238, "resto": 90517987}, {"no": 90529126, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)08:20:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;wear my ccz coffee bean

Been using Linux as a daily driver (no dual boot) for a couple months and I&#039;ve started having doubts about carrying on using it.<br>I&#039;m using Arch, and it&#039;s really nice to use but I feel like I&#039;m the subject of a cruel joke. Everyone in this community dual boots while also shitting on other OS, as if they weren&#039;t using those same OSes as a safety net. I hover over the desktop threads and almost everyone&#039;s using old low res thinkpads they obviously just installed Linux on as a testing machine. The GNU/Linux thread encourages this. GRUB literally prompts me on bootup every single time if I want to boot in to Arch Linux or my BIOS, and it just implies to me that I should be dual booting. The code appears on screen, I don&#039;t want to be a cringey l33t hax0r I just want a smooth computing experience. All DEs are just laughable and people use autistic tiling managers to look like l33t hax0rz, they clearly don&#039;t daily drive it that way. I feel like I&#039;m crippling myself by using it; Wine and Proton are good but I have games I bought/played on Windows I can&#039;t play, like Siege, or Warzone, or even Fortnite, I can&#039;t use Photoshop. I miss not having to wait until next big GNOME release for a fucking file picker, and KDE is even worse and uglier. It feels like I&#039;m just beta testing software. My temps are great, my RAM usage is low, &lt;DX9 games run way better through Proton but everything else is just fucked. <br><br>I can&#039;t go back to Windows, I just hate it. I&#039;m thinking about just buying a Mac instead. No games but it&#039;s just mentally cleansing and I would have a computer that just werks, looks nice and doesn&#039;t fuck up. I&#039;ll continue using Linux until I finally cut my losses and move back to Windows or buy a Mac. Linux is good, but I want an OS I can daily drive. I don&#039;t like dual booting.

You could focus on just training a text completion model and give users a direct access to it, the &quot;FilterAI&quot; would handle the rest. You would not have to worry about someone trying to turn your bot into Nazi or making it output racist stuff. You just instruct the &quot;FilterAI&quot; to block such things.

This is aggravated by the fact that quite a few of those that are sold go through private sales or trades since many are in the hands of collectors who tend to not do public auctions.<br>And that&#039;s not getting into the fact that certain models are more common on foreign markets such as yahoo auctions (240, pc110 etc.) or the Singapore market (S30/31 with Eng keyboard) and the price there would be different from eBay.<br>Secondly the price guide is created with the general public in mind whereas with rarepad since your getting into what is pretty much a collectors market more details matter. A sticker might not change the price much on a X230 but would matter for your models.

I&#039;m not really sure why they care so much about making sure you have an ATNT / Tmobile GoyLine but I&#039;m not interested in participating and still need to open up business accounts for my company. I&#039;m wanting a modern service I can pay with crypto and don&#039;t need to wait for a physical card to arrive in the mail like its 2005.

I didn&#039;t realize the screen had bezels until this thread made me curious and I turned it on to look. They have been there for the whole 600+ hours I have put into programming on this computer and I literally never noticed them before.

It is sad because I like all of the people here. I wish things could have been more enjoyable. There is so much missing potential. They are quality developers, each with very major strengths, and they could also make up for each other&#039;s weaknesses very well, if only communication were more comfortable and if thorough code reviews were actually required of them.

If the XV272U, or any other 1000:1 model, drops down to \u20ac230 again it&#039;d certainly be viable if you&#039;re budgetmaxxing.<br>If you end up saving a bit more there&#039;s the ASUS XG27AQ and MSI MAG27QRF-QD.
