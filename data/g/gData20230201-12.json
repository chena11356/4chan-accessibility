It started as a branch of the open-mmlab project developed by Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK but has been almost completely re-written at every level.<br>Why do we need another training framework<br><br>These are a dime a dozen, no doubt. DL Art School (DLAS) differentiates itself by being configuration driven. You write the model code (specifically, a torch.nn.Module) and (possibly) some losses, then you cobble together a config file written in yaml that tells DLAS how to train it. Swapping model architectures and tuning hyper-parameters is simple and often requires no changes to actual code. You also don&#039;t need to remember complex command line incantations. This effectively enables you to run multiple concurrent experiments that use the same codebase, as well as retain backwards compatibility for past experiments.<br><br>Training effective generators often means juggling multiple loss functions. As a result, DLAS&#039; configuration language is specifically designed to make it easy to support large number of losses and networks that interact with each other. As an example: some GANs I have trained in this framework consist of more than 15 losses and use 2 separate discriminators and require no bespoke code.<br><br>Generators are also notorious GPU memory hogs. I have spent substantial time streamlining the training framework to support gradient checkpointing and FP16. DLAS also supports &quot;mega batching&quot;, where multiple forward passes contribute to a single backward pass. Most models can be trained on midrange GPUs with 8-11GB of memory.<br><br>Modeling Capabilities<br>DLAS was built with extensibility in mind. One of the reasons I&#039;m putting in the effort to better document this code is the incredible ease with which I have been able to train entirely new model types with no changes to the core training code.", "time": 1675233684, "resto": 91263604}, {"no": 91263890, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:42:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91263802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91263802</a><br>tell me what specific information will help you and i will get it for you. just reply to this post with specific information requests, ie techniques, papers, algorithms, optimizations, algorithm explanations etc etc. we will learn a lot.", "time": 1675233720, "resto": 91263604}, {"no": 91263931, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:45:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91263880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91263880</a><br><a href=\"#p91263886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91263886</a><br>Reminder to back up the archive by download zipped copies and such.

The keys of the dict are injected directly into the training state, which you can interact within your configuration file.<br><br>Training and Testing<br>There are currently 3 base scripts for interacting with models.

However, these methods require large amounts of text-speech paired data for model training, and collecting this data is costly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a single-speaker TTS system containing both a spectrogram prediction network and a neural vocoder for the target language, using only 30 min of target language text-speech paired data for training. We evaluate three approaches for training the spectrogram prediction models of our TTS system, which produce mel-spectrograms from the input phoneme sequence: (1) cross-lingual transfer learning, (2) data augmentation, and (3) a combination of the previous two methods. We found that using both cross-lingual transfer learning and augmented data during training resulted in the most natural synthesized target speech output. We also compare single-speaker and multi-speaker training methods, using sequential and simultaneous training, respectively. The multi-speaker models were found to be more effective for constructing a single-speaker, low-resource TTS model. In addition, we trained two Parallel WaveGAN (PWG) neural vocoders, one using 13 h of our augmented data with 30 min of target language data and one using the entire 12 h of the original target language dataset. Our subjective AB preference test indicated that the neural vocoder trained with augmented data achieved almost the same perceived speech quality as the vocoder trained with the entire target language dataset. Overall, we found that our proposed TTS system consisting of a spectrogram prediction network and a PWG neural vocoder was able to achieve reasonable performance using only 30 min of target language training data.", "time": 1675252772, "resto": 91263604}, {"no": 91267117, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)07:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91267095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91267095</a><br>I have asked this once and didn&#039;t get a reply: do you need the dataset to be manually/automatically annotated?

Midjourney absolutely destroys StableDiffusion out-of-the-box, especially now that they have their NijiJourney anime model blended in. It&#039;s not even a close contest. Of course I&#039;m talking about the actual models behind-the-scenes. The public-facing Midjourney can&#039;t do porn or upscale at insanely high resolutions, but that&#039;s because it&#039;s closed-source running on their servers designed to handle tens of thousands of users. Those same users are training the model in real time by selecting the best out of the 4 images they&#039;re presented. To say MidJourney is 10x better than base SD would be an understatement and I&#039;m not trying to shill. I&#039;m trying to emphasize the point that centralized models like MidJourney have an edge over locally hosted ones like SD and how local can still compete.<br><br>Midjourney can understand what you want and give you exactly that. &quot;dvd screengrab, Gimli, Lord of the Rings, Studio Ghibli&quot;.

If it is an m3u8 playlist, you can just drop the playlist URL (not the fragments, the playlist file or URL is usually playlist.m3u8, the first file downloaded when the stream is starting to play) into ffmpeg or mpv and they will handle it just fine.

Since it starts from the bottom (the &quot;thing&quot; comes first), it also minimizes bloat (you write code to support this, rather than writing kitchensink code and then getting to work, for example).", "time": 1675136393, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240268, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How about g audits systemd?<br>Oh wait they can&#039;t.", "time": 1675136527, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240286, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240268</a><br>literally nobody can.", "time": 1675136580, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240324, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:44:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239516</a><br>Just use javascript,bro", "time": 1675136698, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240344, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:46:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239453</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bloated</span><br>Define bloated retard", "time": 1675136779, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240354, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:46:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240344</a><br>cf. unity", "time": 1675136808, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240371, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:47:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239516</a><br>The will never release a game way<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Godot</span>", "time": 1675136859, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240402, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)22:49:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239568</a><br>That game is called &quot;life&quot;, Anon.", "time": 1675136986, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240586, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240051</a><br>a plan I can get behind", "time": 1675137815, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240617, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:05:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239453</a><br>certainly not by copying stardew valley<br>i played it on my core2duo laptop a few years ago and it used 2GB of ram (fucking how) and ran at about 15fps", "time": 1675137932, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240629, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:06:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239536</a><br>For fucks sake somebody who can write zscript make this", "time": 1675137979, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240660, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:07:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240344</a><br>uses considerably more resources than it ought to considering its content", "time": 1675138079, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240685, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:10:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239453</a><br>by learning rust :D", "time": 1675138203, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240746, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:13:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239522</a><br><a href=\"#p91239568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239568</a><br><a href=\"#p91240051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240051</a><br>The main character was finally cured of distrohopping by installing gentoo and then glowies sent dinosaurs with guns after them", "time": 1675138396, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240788, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:16:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239453</a><br>how about a heavy modded woldenstein 3d about stallman invading google mainframes or some shit that can be compiled and runs on all platforms out there", "time": 1675138575, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91240967, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:28:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239516</a><br>The FUCK is Dragonruby? and I thought Lua was a rare language and Construct 2 and Corona were rare SDKs and engines nobody has heard of.", "time": 1675139325, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91241022, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:32:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240268</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just audit 307 million lines of code bro</span><br>Sorry, I&#039;d rather uninstall.", "time": 1675139529, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91241114, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:39:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239453</a><br>You start by going to <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/v/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/</a>", "time": 1675139949, "resto": 91239453}, {"no": 91242494, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)01:30:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91240967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91240967</a><br>Dragonruby is a 2d game engine made in c for ruby that outperforms unity 2d.

I wanted to bring to your attention some serious security concerns with the internal customer and records management system that we are planning to move to the cloud.<br><br>As I&#039;m contracted here to work on the codebase, I have identified the following problems:<br><br>1. Half of the endpoints are not restricted to authorized users, which poses a significant security risk.<br><br>2. A lot of the logic is currently done client-side, which could make the system vulnerable to tampering, data manipulation and access of privileged data.<br><br>3. There is a potential for SQL injection, which could lead to data breaches and the exposure of sensitive information.<br><br>4. The system contains a wealth of employee and customer personal information, including Social Security numbers, and if this information were to be leaked, it would have serious consequences.<br><br>I believe it is imperative that we address these security issues before we move the system to the cloud. I would be happy to work with the development team to find solutions to these problems and ensure that the system is secure before we make the transition.<br><br>Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>[Your name]", "time": 1675248583, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266542, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:58:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266411</a>", "filename": "1613075249348", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 219, "h": 254, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675249096905793, "time": 1675249096, "md5": "4oCjg7qjOiGeQaufaLFX/A==", "fsize": 8158, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266669, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:13:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266464</a><br><a href=\"#p91266452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266452</a><br>They already know.

When you start using Phase Plant it is better to just make patches normally, but you make sure to use the macro knobs, preset description, and you don&#039;t leave things messy, so by doing this all of your patches are going to become &quot;templates&quot;, and over time you will be able to just jump in and load previous patches as templates instead of starting from scratch. Also the same thing for Multipass and Snap Heap, but instead of template for sounds it will be templates for effects, so with Multipass it would be things like OTT, and with Snap Heap for things like a specific reverb that you&#039;ve built.

The advantage of RISC was that it permitted a simpler implementation inside the CPU.

What you&#039;re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux,\u201d and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br><br>    Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#039;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \u201cLinux\u201d distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.", "time": 1675225994, "resto": 91261862}, {"no": 91262080, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:33:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91261862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91261862</a><br>The Linux operating system is decentralized and run by the community, not a single company.", "time": 1675226010, "resto": 91261862}, {"no": 91262105, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:35:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91261862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91261862</a><br>Like this?<br><br>https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learnin<wbr>g/laptops/tensorbook", "filename": "tensorbook", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 650, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1675226124391195, "time": 1675226124, "md5": "eeHWDZKttH/ulL+aXwYM/Q==", "fsize": 549587, "resto": 91261862}, {"no": 91262862, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91261862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91261862</a><br>If everyone who has contributed to the linux kernel got a cut of apple&#039;s market cap, they&#039;d each have $150 million", "time": 1675229311, "resto": 91261862}, {"no": 91263001, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:38:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91262862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91262862</a><br>Steve Jobs offered Linus himself a top spot and would&#039;ve been the lead dev after Avie Tevanian left.
