A rubber stamp you keep up your asshole and never initial anything without is enough to deter just about everything as long as the security of that stamp and the validity of any signature made without it is never, ever in question. Using your Tuesday initial for Spring, or whatever arbitrary system you set, right now should throw off some red flags even if it looks like your scrawl and the ink matches. When you break out your CMA book in court, all the little details need to align and not be in conflict with the gas station receipts and concert photos from that day, and especially not with the proprietary details of your system that are apparent on every record.<br><br>I barely do what could be considered clerical work and all this is SOP for anyone half retarded. The smart fuckers doing legal or high security work are even more paranoid. This is just the 100 level class, general authenticity.

To put it simply the world moved towards allowing women the right to self-actualization in all the ways that we allow to men. This is probably a good thing. &#039;Humans should have the right to freedom&#039; is an axiom I ascribe to. I think a vast majority of learned men also believe in this axiom.<br>Unrestricted self-actualization being progressively granted to 50% of people has had some interactions with human biases though. The fact seems to be that there are some differences between male and female tendencies and capabilities. And if you apply several standard deviations to any two populations with a couple minor differences in tendencies and capabilities, the outliers within those populations will appear as two populations with a far greater separation than is seen in the average person. This is especially true in the populations of human males and females since it seems that the value for standard deviation is far higher for males. This makes buckets of sense from an evolutionary perspective. If a man had a much higher variation he could have an IQ of 150 as easily as he could have an IQ of 50. (substitute for strength, or any positive attribute), and the male of higher capabilities would be more likely to create more offspring than the lesser male.", "time": 1674962560, "resto": 91185911}, {"no": 91191240, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:24:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91185911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91185911</a><br>post her dick", "time": 1674962646, "resto": 91185911}, {"no": 91191264, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:25:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91191217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91191217</a><br>[2/2]<br>Going back to the trans issue. Since we&#039;ve given women the right to self-actualization (a good thing imho), we have encountered human bias that forces us to ascribe to merit what should be seen as a simple human right. That is, women must be &#039;as good as men&#039; at every single thing. This core premise is false. If we dismiss this core premise then the trans issue also holds less water. We can instead say &quot;yes, men can live in this role of trans-woman, which is a male human but we will refer to him as her&quot;. But unless this core issue is confronted more and more trans-women will be taking the spotlight from incredible women who are so many standard deviations from the average woman that they may actually be one-in-several-billion. This may be equivalent to a one-in-a-million man, but that&#039;s still a big enough deal that they could impact our future as a species. They should be celebrated and nurtured. Not forced to navigate their natural feminine agreeableness and get their positions stolen by trans-women. And again, that&#039;s not to say the achievement of a trans-woman aren&#039;t worth celebrating. But in almost any field they should be in the same category as the rest of the males.<br>I guess that&#039;s a lot of words to simply say we (anon internet) are wasting a lot of words on the trans question. If we instead start redirecting to the core fault in societal thought I feel like things would be better received.

He owns four ThinkPads at least. While I see nothing wrong with them in themselves, as they are admittedly pretty good value for the price, four is just mindless consumerism, contradictory to his &quot;philosophy&quot;. He started using every single shitty pseudominimalist, ncurses-based program, used a shitty riced out i3 setup of dubious actual productivity (like all tiling wms), then fell for the full Suckless meme and went in even deeper. Then he started making videos shitting on Python and praising C, which is ironic considering he is not even a programmer by his own admission. He effectively spent years trying out, configuring and hopelessly trying to integrate tens of meme programs to build what is, combined, effectively a shittier Emacs, just like most of /g/ was doing in their &quot;productive&quot; desktop threads a year or two ago. Then he read the Unabomber manifesto and blindly accepted it without constructively analyzing it first, same with the anarcho-primitivist ideology that was all the rage about a year and a half ago on 4chan and 8ch. While he stated on his website that he &quot;didn&#039;t browse 4chan much anymore&quot; it was obvious this wasn&#039;t the case.Then he went and took the memes way too far, and unironically went to live in isolation. While I see nothing wrong in itself, the actual reason he did it is massive cringe. He has the mentality of someone 10 years younger than he is, yet he acts like a literal boomer jokingly criticizing &quot;zoomers&quot; despite he himself being the worst example of a millennial. He attacks &quot;nerds&quot; when it&#039;t painfully obvious he&#039;s deeply unhappy with himself, as it was obviously self-directed criticism thinly veiled as an edgy dabbing video.
