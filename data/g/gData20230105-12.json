At best I did &quot;kissed&quot; and &quot;hugged&quot; her like in a sense of a puppy love, or a younger brother to his big sister. Most people here would use these characters AI as an alternative to porn due to how &quot;immersive&quot; it is but every time I try to be more horny I just can&#039;t let it out.

Generate a fancy image in 512x512. Let us say it was a cfg 10. Make sure it lacks extremely sharp detail, as fuzzy but non-blurry starter images work best.<br>2. img2img -&gt; &quot;resize and fill&quot; -&gt; upscale to a wide resolution like 1280x768 (i do not know if this trick of mine will work with tall resolutions) -&gt; increase cfg to 16 and set denoising to a low value like 0.5. your  result with be aesthetically pleasing but show the fill lines terribly.<br>3. Repeat this a few times, randomly changing cfg and denoising inversely proportional, until you get sharp shapes and features orthogonal to the original img2img result. Use a variation seed with modest strength now and then.<br>4. Touch-up in krita for fun. I added a blood moon, white clouds and little white highlights on the flames coming out of her finger. These touch-up features will be lost in the next step, but they should be semantically-coherent features.<br>5. Repeat img2img, this time reset your cfg back to its original value of 10 and crank-up the denoising strength to 0.95 if you want to keep a semblance of your painted-in features or 0.98 (it must not be lower) to greatly influence the next image generation merely stylistically. Add a random variation seed, too, with modest strength. Make a grid and choose  your favorite. The color palette will suddenly massively widen (if you do flat-tone-color images), making further krita touch-ups challenging. Optionally throw in a different model if you feel like challenging yourself.

Every third day i do stuff for gains, not to mention, I dont use any products like creatine or protein powder. My food is more or less 600kcal chicken with thyme and thats it.<br><a href=\"#p90709738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90709738</a><br>When I was kid, at max, I could sleep 7 hours. As i got older my body just started loosing interest into sleeping. Yesterday I slept from 1:30 am to 5 am without puting alarm or nothing. I just wake up after sleeping short amounts of time. The only question if i have interest in something. When i am bored my body just gives up on staying awake though. When i was with family for holidays, slept of average 13 hours for a week.

Then on the phone side usually cheapo $10 wired headphones that /CSG/ were shilled over the years and last 1.5 years some cheaper semi wireless headphones (JAM or JBL brand i believe) that were like $30.

The implication being that emphasizing traits found specifically in  sexually immature organizsms effectively makes them dumber and more docile. Which makes sense, because the sexually inactive members of species has to act subservient to the larger, more grown ones so they dont get killed. Coincidently, a lot of social engineering schemes since that study has included artifically extending child hood and creating scientific justifications for depriving people of their rights for longer periods of time.<br><br>The behaviors you learn as a teenager, carry with you into adulthood regardless of your legal-age-status. This means you can create a population of irresponsible manchildren/consoomers if you explicitly stiffle their mental and physical development during their teenage years. What people should focus on isn&#039;t an arbitrary age group but rather the personal rights and responsibilities said individual is expected to have/do by said age. <br><br>And whats weird is that we all fundementally know this to be true without saying so. You understand, as a mother or a father, or as a brother or a sister, that if  you let a younger relative act retarded, they are going to keep acting retarded. They do not &#039;grow up&#039; once they hit some random chronological number.

The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation. Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ. One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Linux is an OS -- more on this later). He named it &#039;Linux&#039; with a little help from his friends. Why doesn&#039;t he call it GNU/Linux? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don&#039;t want to be known as a nag, do you? Linux is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies wherever you see Linux in use. However, Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system, a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Linux (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title &#039;GNU/Linux&#039; (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.", "filename": "1671485452274398", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 4032, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672897765398658, "time": 1672897765, "md5": "bl3JCEiG2dbKQDxKRcDHxg==", "fsize": 2228253, "resto": 90711287, "trip": "!6mAnCkeuSQ"}, {"no": 90712540, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)00:50:36", "name": "I&#039;m white and I use Linux", "com": "<a href=\"#p90711823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90711823</a><br>Next, even if we limit the GNU/Linux title to the GNU-based Linux distributions, we run into another obvious problem. XFree86 may well be more important to a particular Linux installation than the sum of all the GNU contributions. More properly, shouldn&#039;t the distribution be called XFree86/Linux? Or, at a minimum, XFree86/GNU/Linux? Of course, it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted. Yes, I know you&#039;ve heard this one before. Get used to it. You&#039;ll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it.<br>You seem to like the lines-of-code metric. There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Linux distribution. You seem to suggest that (more LOC) == (more important). However, I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance. I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric. For example, if my system spends 90% of its time executing XFree86 code, XFree86 is probably the single most important collection of code on my system. Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware, it certainly isn&#039;t more important code than XFree86. Obviously, this metric isn&#039;t perfect either, but LOC really, really sucks. Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument. Last, I&#039;d like to point out that we Linux and GNU users shouldn&#039;t be fighting among ourselves over naming other people&#039;s software. But what the heck, I&#039;m in a bad mood now. I think I&#039;m feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and, yes, so very useful only because Linux was developed. In a show of proper respect and gratitude, shouldn&#039;t you and everyone refer to GCC as &#039;the Linux compiler&#039;? Or at least, &#039;Linux GCC&#039;?

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

Notes are the most troublesome part to write, everything else you can automate or program. You can use your MIDI keyboard for drums too, so a drumpad is not essential at first. The less things you have to deal with at the beginning, the faster you&#039;re gonna learn. You&#039;re gonna have to trust me on this one. DAWs and virtual synths are an endless rabbit hole, and it&#039;s better to explore them first -a lot- and then see what hardware you need for your specific goals instead of the other way around. If you reach a point where you simply can&#039;t live without an extra fader or knob, you can customize your controllers with exactly what you need for a cheap buck or maybe during your learning curve save money to get that fancy controller of your dreams. You&#039;ll probably change your mind a couple of times while you learn, maybe you decide that the computer is not enough and go for a hybrid or full DAW-less setup. Go very slow on the spending because if you don&#039;t have a clear goal and buy the wrong thing, it can get pretty frustrating.

As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The &lt;center&gt; cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty.

Kant argued that morality was not always black and white, but could be seen as a spectrum with shades of grey.  He argued that moral decisions should not be based on personal preferences or feelings, but rather on a universal set of principles that could be applied to any situation. This means that there is no single right answer to any moral dilemma, and instead, each situation must be evaluated on its own merits. Kant&#039;s concept of &quot;morally grey&quot; allows for a more nuanced approach to morality, as it acknowledges that there may be multiple valid solutions to any given problem.</span><br>user<br>have you actually studied philosophy? how does this coincide with his famous contention that lying is never okay?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, I have not studied philosophy.

I was referring to his assertion that lying is never okay which is backed by moral law. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, lying is generally considered to be wrong and immoral, and it is usually not acceptable in most societies. However, there are some cases where lying may be necessary or even beneficial, such as when it is used to protect someone from harm or to prevent a greater harm from occurring. In these cases, lying may be seen as a moral act.</span><br>If one lies, one has broken the moral law. There is no nuance in Kantian philosophy about this. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kantian philosophy does not allow for any exceptions to the moral law. According to Kant, lying is always wrong and should never be done. He believed that lying was a violation of the categorical imperative, which states that one should never act in a way that would be impossible to universalize. Lying is an action that cannot be universalized, as it would lead to a world where no one could trust anyone else. Therefore, Kant believed that lying was always wrong and should never be done.</span><br>Therefore, Kant did not invent the concept of &quot;morally grey&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, Kant did not invent the concept of &quot;morally grey&quot;. The concept of moral ambiguity has been around for centuries, and can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. Kant&#039;s moral philosophy was based on the idea of absolute moral principles, and he believed that all actions should be judged according to a universal set of ethical standards.

PCs run on three main voltages so a PSU will minimally have one rail for each. These days the main components run off +12V so we&#039;ll focus on that. With higher power demands it can be more cost effective and/or safer to split the demand across multiple rails. Hence &quot;multi-rail&quot; PSUs. The takeaway, from a consumer perspective, is that on a single-rail unit you don&#039;t have to pay any mind to which sockets you use whereas on a multi-rail unit you do. It&#039;s maybe 5 minutes of extra work during assembly. Note that there&#039;s a qualitative difference between a cheap PSU using multi-rail because it&#039;s cheap and a high-end one using it for better protection. As a general rule don&#039;t buy cheap PSUs and especially don&#039;t buy cheap multi-rail ones.", "time": 1672908225, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714570, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:43:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714542</a><br><a href=\"#p90714548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714548</a><br>just get a 5800x3d bro, you already have the mobo. <br><br>zen 4 3d will be a flop until they cut prices of those as well. <br>these days GPUS are autistically expensive that you shouldn&#039;t spend more than 400$ on a cpu so you have room to budget in a gpu, and GPUS are far bigger performance increases than  13% uplift on dota fucking 2 at 1080p", "time": 1672908230, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714579, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:44:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714526</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;amdrones are hyping it up without knowing prices</span><br>As opposed to nvidiots and Intel sheep who never shill, right?", "filename": "1672855185553096", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1288, "h": 1036, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1672908279643983, "time": 1672908279, "md5": "qrGVF6KMpOVl3cmC28toWw==", "fsize": 106085, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714584, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714566</a><br>I have to buy it to find out if it&#039;ll work?", "time": 1672908297, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714592, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714564</a><br>we&#039;re not on /int/ THOUGH", "time": 1672908346, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714593, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714549</a><br><a href=\"#p90714548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714548</a><br><a href=\"#p90714546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714546</a><br><a href=\"#p90714570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714570</a><br>thank you bros, i should have specified that it would be the 5800x3d id go for considering the recent amd keynote. i have a microcenter nearby but even then its a lot more cost effective to stay on am4 for now.", "time": 1672908347, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714600, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:46:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714579</a><br>Who shilled the 4070 Ti that it will be 3x performane of a 3090 Ti?<br><br>I literally said it will be a margin of error 3090 Ti at 250w<br><br>AMDrone seething that intel and nvidia make better products, his brain is at a 110c hotspot as well.", "time": 1672908364, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714602, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:46:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714592</a><br>/g/ is an /int/ colony", "time": 1672908370, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714604, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "At what european time 4070Ti will be available to purchase?", "time": 1672908377, "resto": 90714377}, {"no": 90714605, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:46:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90714584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90714584</a><br>If they&#039;re reputable they have pictures of the sticker or details of the rail specs on their product page.

Even the biggest dick swinging Asus ROG X670E Crosshair Extreme is only $999 (MSI actually priced their GODLIKE higher, at $1200, but it isn&#039;t quite as good and certainly should not cost more than the Asus Crosshair Extreme)  and there are LOTS of cheaper boards including the Asus Crosshair Hero (or Gene, if you want a mATX board.

Raytracing is the only thing that it lags behind but even so its only a bit behind the 4080 and is comparable/slightly better than the 3090 Ti so it wasn&#039;t like it was abject garbage or anything.
