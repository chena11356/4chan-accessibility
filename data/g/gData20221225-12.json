That&#039;s usually what it&#039;s called when one of those &quot;home gateway&quot; pieces of crap has a mode you can put it in to disable all the routing, access-point and network-services stuff. Ideally, it has a &quot;true&quot; bridge mode where it looks to everything behind it just like a plain modem. If you&#039;re less lucky it might have a fake bridge mode, where it continues to do its own DHCP with your ISP, but just then reassigns whatever it gets to its client (your own router) and does nothing else. This intermediate DHCP handshake interferes with a few things but for normie purposes itll be fine. if you&#039;re unlucky, it won&#039;t have bridge mode and you have to do double NAT. Some ISP hardware is indeed this crappy.

Started with Cherry Silent Reds (45g) then to Kailh Speed Silvers (50g) then to Kailh Box Silent Pinks (35g) and just recently got some TTC Gold Pinks (38g). Lighter switches are the best because they enable fast, accurate typing, though they do take some time to get used to. Lots of double or accidental entry will happen until you normalize the force needed to actuate, but in the end it will only make you a better typist.<br>I really like the sound of the Gold Pinks, but being a bit heavier than the Silent Pinks it did take a while to acclimate. Out of all the switches, though, I think I liked the Speed Silvers the best. I&#039;m almost willing to go back to them, but I don&#039;t want to purchase them right now just to put the rest of my switches to pasture forever. They&#039;re a bit heavier but way smoother, just feel good to type on. If I did I would mod them with a lower actuation spring anyway, so not even sure it&#039;s worth the effort.<br>35g is about as low as you can go with MX profile, and Silent Pinks and Gold Pinks are both great options. But from 68g I&#039;d suggest trying out Speed Silvers first (they are relatively cheap - 35 for $15) and then go lower depending on what you like. From my experience, once you go low you never want to go back; it&#039;s just pointless to use additional force and overall is better for your wrists as long as you learn to type gingerly and don&#039;t smash the keys into oblivion.", "time": 1671728713, "resto": 90427734}, {"no": 90457257, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:12:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90456982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90456982</a><br>They are decorative and not everyone can type without legends, retarded faggot.", "time": 1671729132, "resto": 90427734}, {"no": 90457312, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:15:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90427952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90427952</a><br>If you&#039;re not married to 100 and think 75 would give you everything you need, the Reddragon PRO series now comes with full hot-swap capability:<br>https://redragonshop.com/products/6<wbr>5-percent-keyboard<br>Extremely cheap and will be mostly silent with Reds, could always use a little extra cash to get some silent switches if you want to go quieter or lighter.

The point is that your architecture should give the compiler enough of a chance that compiled code will be good enough in almost all circumstances. And those whose business it is to hack assembler can concentrate on the places where nothing else will do. e.g., for various crypto functions, Linux has several implementations, some of which are hand-optimized arch-specific assembly. Since even a small speedup can make a difference there, and there may be other concerns, like making an implementation constant-time. <br><br>But the point is that even for an architecture like x86 that&#039;s very much a dog&#039;s breakfast, the C compiler can do a very good job for 99.9% of the kernel. (to continue this specific example, any other program, it&#039;s even more true of) Those rare and wizardly assembly programmers don&#039;t need to work on the whole thing. For the vast majority of the code, there&#039;d be little or no benefit implementing it in assembly instead of C. That was the problem with IA-64, because it leaned so much on the premise of getting instruction ordering correct ahead of time, to save the silicon the trouble of doing it at runtime, compilers were noticeably and significantly worse than hand-tuned assembly. If performance was important, the black magic paid off everywhere, since a compiler just couldn&#039;t do it well. And there just aren&#039;t that many assembly programmers; even if there were, they might well want to do other things.

All that stuff happens at runtime, it depends on a lot of things outside the compiler&#039;s control. e.g., OS scheduler decisions - has this core been running a particular application for a long time, or did the scheduler just recently kick something else off this core to run me?

By the time I had configured all these things I realised it would have been simpler and better to have set up my own NAS for a number of reasons but more importantly that it only took me a couple of weekends of tooling around to acquire the skills and confidence to run my own NAS using something like TrueNAS. I&#039;ll keep using the Synology for now but sooner or later I&#039;m going to learn about reverse proxy etc. so I can share my Jellyfin server with friends/family at which point I will need to build a new machine too handle the transcoding and realistically most of my Docker based services can be moved onto that machine.

You fell for the biggest piece of audiophile bullshit in the world, that you&#039;re paying more money for better sound quality instead of the resulting placebo effect. You cannot tell me why the HD800S sounds better than any other headphones without it being nonquantifiable audiophile hocus pocus because all evidence points to frequency response being pretty much everything and there it doesn&#039;t standout. There is a near zero percent chance you could pick out the $2,000 ADI-2 from a cheap amp, or even a cheap motherboard with relatively low distortion, in blind testing. Nor could you pick out the $59,000 HE-1 from $150 headphones painstakingly EQed to sound the same to your ear, or vice versa because that works too.  <br><br>The most egregious flaws in FR are still pretty subtle. Research will tell us that mostly everyone will prefer one target over another target when listening to certain songs but it doesn&#039;t tell us if the difference is meaningful or if you would actually care either way. Even if we found a target that is 100% objectively correct and somehow works for everyone despite head-related transfer function it wouldn&#039;t sound that impressive during blind testing. It wouldn&#039;t change the biggest problem in the industry, which is that nothing mixed correctly because room size, shape, and treatment creates more variability than what is found between any two good speakers. This hobby sucks because no one wants to accept a harsh reality that would invalidate all their feelings and make them feel ashamed, they seek a religious experience that nothing can give them so instead they just pay more money and stick their head in the sand.

The biggest one was probably the shibazi F208. I love cooking and while I did own a great knife (a shun classic chefs knife) it was a little too long for my tastes and my other knives were all rather cheap ones made from questionable steel. The F208 (for around 30\u20ac at the time) is perfect for me and a real joy to use. Since it&#039;s something I use everyday (and thus something that makes me happy every day) it&#039;s probably the item with the largest enjoyment payoff. <br>The second one could be my ramen blanket. It was cheap-ish holds up super well, is soft and is more versatile than I thought (working as a blanket and pillow). If I don&#039;t use it as a blanket I use it as a cover over my chair to sit on. I also use it as a travel pillow/blanket combo sometimes when I sleep somewhere else or for long trips.<br>Third is a generic hip bag that I use for fishing equipment. It&#039;s nothing special, but the fact that I no longer have to carry a giant and unwieldy bag and instead feel like I barely have anything with me is a big improvement in quality of life. <br>Latest one is my camping stuff, as someone who enjoys camping but used to use random shot from around the flat I now managed to replace most of those things with items that weigh half, have maybe a fourth the volume all while feeling more comfortable and high quality. Mostly the sleeping bag, cutlery and tent are big improvements. Only tested those out once so far to be fair (because it&#039;s fucking cold) but that&#039;s quite the enjoyment for now. <br>If you are looking for something cheaper, it&#039;s either my wallet (the one in last thread in the 3 for 6 deal) for 2$ or a metal comb that I got a year back or so.

I refunded 3-4 things, mostly stuff that was way out of advertised specs with picture proof. I got those things refunded no problem. Those items were below 10$.<br><br>I recently bought a 25$ item which was marked as &quot;delivered&quot; in the tracking, but i didn&#039;t actually get it. I opened a dispute stating that i didn&#039;t get it, and aliexpress denied the refund and closed the dispute.<br>I appealed the dispute and send surveillance video camera footage of the mailbox of the time in question, which shows delivery guy showing up, but only tossing some small envelopes into mailboxes, nothing of the size in question. Aliexpress denied the appeal as well.<br>Meanwhile a neighbour found a rain-soaked envelope with the item in question which he claims he found on the fire escape. Idk how he actually got it, he&#039;s a dodgy guy i don&#039;t trust.<br><br>I am wondering if aliexpress only gives one a certain refund quota per year/month/XX deliveries, or if refunds are handeled differently depending on the amount in question.<br><br>I am also wondering if aliexpress always trusts the tracking info.<br><br>I had cases where local companies mailed me shit, and someone stole the package. The usual process is that i vouch for not having received the package, and then the delivery company will reimburse the vendor since the package is insured. I sometimes provided video evidence from the surveillance camera since the delivery guy would just leave the package on the ground and it would get stolen that way.<br>Aliexpress does not seem to entertain these ideas, they tell me to contact &quot;delivery company customer service&quot; but the delivery company does not recognize the receiver as their contract partner, but rather the sender.

There are many plugins with 2-3 large knobs and a bunch of smaller ones to emphasize their go-to parameters, but try doing that with a fader. Knobs/dials/sliders stay fixed in position which is their crucial benefit for UI layout. Faders require a lot of space. Absolutely nothing about Surge immediately grabs my attention. All the faders are pretty much the same length/size/color and they&#039;re fucking everywhere.

Random note path<br>    Creates the path of the melody for a scale (or subset). So if you choose c major pendatic scale, and roll 2 4 5 1, you make a meldoy that goes D F G C.<br>2. Random progression<br>   Create a random progression, or more interesting, roll for what note that the melody will use from the progression. So if I have C F Dm G, I would roll 1, 3, 2, 3. With this, I use the 1, 3, 2 and 3 degrees of each chord, making a meldoy that goes C, A, F, D.<br>3. Polymeter<br>   Generate the ratio between two sounds.  So if I get 4/6, I make a polymeter out of that<br>4. Energy Level/dynamics<br>   Decide what the energy level for a section could be. It&#039;s interpretive, so just go by 1-5, and get an idea of what it means<br>5. Syncopatction<br>   You could roll a die to see which beats gets accented and which don&#039;t.  <br>6.

There are three methods in which user-accessible fine tuning can be applied to a Stable Diffusion model checkpoint:<br><br>An &quot;embedding&quot; can be trained from a collection of user-provided images, and allows the model to generate visually similar images whenever the name of the embedding is used within a generation prompt.[34] Embeddings are based on the &quot;textual inversion&quot; concept developed by researchers from Tel Aviv University in 2022 with support from Nvidia, where vector representations for specific tokens used by the model&#039;s text encoder are linked to new pseudo-words. Embeddings can be used to reduce biases within the original model, or mimic visual styles.[35]<br>A &quot;Hypernetwork&quot; is a small pre-trained neural network that is applied to various points within a larger neural network, and refers to the technique created by NovelAI developer Kurumuz in 2021, originally intended for text-generation transformer models. Hypernetworks steer results towards a particular direction, allowing Stable Diffusion-based models to imitate the art style of specific artists, even if the artist is not recognised by the original model; they process the image by finding key areas of importance such as hair and eyes, and then patch these areas in secondary latent space.[36]<br>DreamBooth is a deep learning generation model developed by researchers from Google Research and Boston University in 2022 which can fine-tune the model to generate precise, personalised outputs that depict a specific subject, following training via a set of images which depict the subject.[37]", "time": 1671968543, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512263, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:43:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90512251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90512251</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tel Aviv</span><br>ai-cucks confirmed for filthy yids", "time": 1671968616, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512277, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:44:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90512251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90512251</a><br>This is why I said &quot;when they use it to generate images&quot;.", "time": 1671968664, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512307, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:47:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90510247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90510247</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A computer cannot claim inspiration</span><br>What you call as &quot;inspiration&quot; is the idea of stealing from others, be it art or nature or whatever<br>So you will seethe either way if it doesn&#039;t fits in your own world view", "time": 1671968824, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512324, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:49:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i use the thing </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;therefore i understand the thing</span><br>No", "time": 1671968959, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512336, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:50:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i hate the thing </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;therefore i understand the thing</span><br>No", "time": 1671969015, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512351, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:51:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i don&#039;t care</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;therefore i understand the thing</span><br>Yes", "filename": "file(48)", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671969108680043, "time": 1671969108, "md5": "QrdUNgGbt0vrEaKf0neeeQ==", "fsize": 1321845, "resto": 90509467}, {"no": 90512375, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90512307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90512307</a><br>no it isn&#039;t, you people are clinically retarded.

Firstly the volume of rarepads sold isn&#039;t really enough to create a decent price database and you can&#039;t use prices that are old since the market changes. This is aggravated by the fact that quite a few of those that are sold go through private sales or trades since many are in the hands of collectors who tend to not do public auctions.<br>And that&#039;s not getting into the fact that certain models are more common on foreign markets such as yahoo auctions (240, pc110 etc.) or the Singapore market (S30/31 with Eng keyboard) and the price there would be different from eBay.<br>Secondly the price guide is created with the general public in mind whereas with rarepad since your getting into what is pretty much a collectors market more details matter. A sticker might not change the price much on a X230 but would matter for your models. I&#039;ve seen someone pay a premium because a model had the original IBM background on the desktop screen.<br>Thirdly i don&#039;t really see who&#039;d benefit from such a guide.

For that one vs the latest top end model, all you&#039;re really missing is the hard brushing indicator, the 15 second timers, a second speed setting, and making the on/off button plastic with a rubber surround since that all-rubber one tears after a few years of use.

C does not have an STL. The STL is the Standard TEMPLATE Library, and is a part of C++&#039;s stdlib. It is not a term applicable to other languages.<br>2. Rust does not have random number generation in its standard library. Therefore, you are comparing the standard library of one language with a third party library in another language.<br>3. You can compare algorithms, or you can compare code generation, but you can&#039;t compare both. A benchmark should focus on one aspect of languages. When we want to say that a language is faster, you are typically executing the same algorithm, through different compilers. If you have similar compilers, it may make sense to compare two different algorithms, but this should be a statement about the strengths of the algorithms, not the strength of the compilers. Incidentally, C&#039;s default random number generator is not known for being very good. It is very common for programmers to use something else.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The algorithm in GNU&#039;s C STL should be faster than OS entropy</span><br>This is an absolutely nonsensical expectation. The rand() function is expected only to produce pseudo-random numbers, with no additional expectations. On common design decision when implementing this function for libc is to make it forever backwards compatible. This means that if I have a random seed s and give it to a program compiled 20 years ago, updating libc and using the same s as input will result in the same execution.

When I was in undergrad, I had a project in C++ that I spent several hours in a lab finishing up, after dealing with a number of bugs all related to networking bullshit. This project spanned several files, and I had spent several days working on it. I had finally reached what I believed to be a working application that met the requirements for the assignment, so all I had to do was tar the files up and submit it.

The argument immediately following the -cvf is supposed to be the output. So naturally, the command takes all of my cpp files except the first alphabetically, and puts them into a tar file whose name ended in .cpp and overwrote that file. Had I used git to keep a record of previous versions of my files, this would have been a 1 or 2 minute fix.

It can be easy for inexperienced users to fall victim to these tactics, especially when they are presented with a barrage of convincing arguments and emotional appeals.<br><br>As someone who has learned from experience, I want to offer some words of advice to help you protect yourselves from falling victim to extremist propaganda.<br><br>First and foremost, it is important to educate yourself. The more you know about a topic, the better equipped you will be to critically evaluate the information that you encounter online. Don&#039;t be afraid to seek out diverse perspectives, even if they challenge your own beliefs. It is important to consider all sides of an issue in order to make informed decisions.<br><br>Another tip is to be aware of cognitive biases. We all have mental shortcuts that can lead us to make flawed judgments and decisions. By being aware of these biases, you can recognize when you might be at risk of falling prey to propaganda.<br><br>It is also important to verify the credibility of the sources of information you consume. Don&#039;t blindly accept everything you read or hear online. Take the time to fact check and seek out trusted sources of information.<br><br>Finally, don&#039;t be afraid to take breaks from social media. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the constant stream of information on these platforms. Taking breaks can help you disconnect and recharge, giving you the mental space you need to make more informed decisions.<br><br>I hope these tips are helpful to you, Anons. Remember, it is always important to think critically and be aware of the tactics that extremists use to spread their propaganda.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the tactics and dangers posed by these groups.<br><br>One tactic frequently used by right-wing extremist groups is the co-opting of popular memes and repurposing them to spread propaganda and misinformation. This can be done through the creation of altered versions of existing memes, or by using familiar meme formats to convey extremist messages. This tactic is effective because it allows the groups to present their content in a familiar and often humorous context, making it more difficult for individuals to recognize the true nature of the message.<br><br>Another tactic used by these groups is the exploitation of &quot;meme magic,&quot; the belief that the repetition of a meme can make it a reality. This belief is based on the premise that the human brain is susceptible to suggestion and that the repetition of a meme can influence behavior and decision-making. This tactic has been used to promote conspiracy theories and misinformation, as well as to manipulate public opinion on a variety of issues.<br><br>The dangers of these tactics are clear. By using memes to spread propaganda and misinformation, right-wing extremist groups can shape public opinion and influence policy decisions. They can also normalize hateful or extremist viewpoints, making them more acceptable to a wider audience.

With regard to trannies, they pissed off Keffals, a famous tranny e-celeb, by posting screenshots of her underage catboy grooming Discord and her operation to distribute HRT to minors behind their parents&#039; backs. So Keffals started a campaign to pressure anti-DDoS providers and ISPs into dropping Kiwi Farms. It was easy for her to rally people to her cause because she has a lot of followers and because a lot of other trannies were already angry at Kiwi Farms for digging up their sordid backstories they don&#039;t want people to know. Things heated up and Keffals got doxed multiple times, including a dox from hotel bedsheets and a dox from wallpaper and doorknob. So she ran to the media with a press kit that lazy journalists could just copy-paste from, and that&#039;s how we got multiple articles about the Farms at the same time.<br>As for why people hated Keffals in the first place, it&#039;s because she&#039;s an Internet crybully and expert in being a victim. The usual modus operandi is<br>1. Enter a conversation/debate with some other e-celeb and pretend to have good faith.<br>2. Really piss him off in a way that&#039;s technically not against the rules, such as accusing a man of being a rapist.<br>3. When he gets angry enough to slip up and say something transphobic, take screenshots and pressure his platform into dropping him.<br>4.

This causes INTPs (who happen to cluster on the internet and possess autism) to impress themselves upon her.

It manages to both speak to some on a spiritual level, and creep others out enough to make them consider it a psychological thriller.

Write protect the flash chip. Put nail polish on the screws and take high resolution pictures to ensure signs of tampering. Do NOT use a HDD or SSD. They have DMA so a malicious firmware could do a lot of damage, use of USB is preferred since they do not have DMA. Completely remove the microphone, sound card, webcam and the WWAN card from the laptop. Remove the fan to prevent binary acoustic data transmission. Replace the default wifi card with a supported atheros card. Disable wifi when not in use, preferably by physically removing the card. Make your own independent Linux distro from scratch. Most Linux distros value convenience over security and will thus never have good security. Your only option is to make your own. Use musl instead of glibc, Libressl instead of openssl, sinit instead of systemd, oksh instead of bash, toybox instead of gnu coreutils to reduce attack surface. Enable as little kernel modules as possible. Use a hardened memory allocator. Apply strong SELinux and sandboxing policies. Restrict the root account heavily to make sure it never gets compromised. Disable JavaScript and CSS in your browser. Block all FAGMAN domains in your hosts file. Monitor all network requests. Do not use a phone. Never speak near anyone who owns a phone, they are always listening. Never use any non-corebooted technology made after 2006. Never leave your devices unattended. Tape triple layer aluminum foil all around your room as tempest shielding. Type really quietly as defense against audio keylogging. Use ecc ram to minimize rowhammer and rambleed. Encrypt everything multiple times with various different encryption implementations. Compile everything from source. Use hardened compilation flags.

Date: 2003-12-30<br>Nevada is infamous for legalized prostitution. One of a kind in respect to the entire country USA. While at Vegas, i thought of hooking up with a hooker. I want to get a blowjob, and want to carry a girl, and other less speakable things. Along The Strip at night, little cards are handed out to pedestrians. These cards have star-nippled girls and phone numbers printed on them. They seem to be advertisement for prostitutes. After some research, it seems that the ladies and phone numbers on the card only offer erotic dances sort of thing, and that prostitution is actually not legal in Clark County, where Las Vegas is in. This is a dubious fact, and probably not strictly enforced. I mean c&#039;mon, people came from all over the world to Vegas for the sin, and fornication is a grandest sin. It is not likely that magnates or vacationers staying in lush Vegas hotels surrounded by skin shows couldn&#039;t get a commercial lay. Though, it is true that one don&#039;t see pimps or harlots soliciting tourists along The Strip, nor brothels to be seen in the city. It makes sense. Tourists offended by prostitution won&#039;t spoil their vacation by harlots strutting their stuff on the street, while sex seekers can easily find their trading partner unobstructed by rules of conduct of the community. A optimal strategy to suck the blood of tourists on this issue.<br><br>While doing \u201cresearch\u201d on prostitution, one phenomenon stands out. That there are lots of advertisements from all medias, so many ladies, so many lines of peddling, so many styles\u2026 i thought of the economics of competition. I imagine being a successful prostitute ain&#039;t as easy even if you are a looker. One has to find a channel. On one hand, agencies suck huge amount off your bodily work, perhaps 50%, on the other hand, a independent prostitute faces a plethora of problems, among which is advertisement, safety, competition, and so on.", "filename": "vegas_sex_cards2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671940859412932, "time": 1671940859, "md5": "99fjL8iz+vVLYX/4a2Q5mw==", "fsize": 176454, "resto": 90500304}, {"no": 90506821, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lex<br>is<br>a<br>jew<br>that&#039;s<br>all<br>you<br>need<br>to<br>know", "time": 1671941064, "resto": 90500304}, {"no": 90506861, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:08:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90500304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90500304</a><br>Dude<br>Like<br>Love", "time": 1671941284, "resto": 90500304}, {"no": 90506900, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)23:11:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90500601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90500601</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;russian sympathizer</span><br>Does he really", "time": 1671941480, "resto": 90500304}, {"no": 90509991, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)03:20:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90504300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90504300</a><br><a href=\"#p90506696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90506696</a><br>How much of a newfag are you? you motherfucker", "time": 1671956403, "resto": 90500304}]}]
