(that&#039;s very convenient and democratic).<br><br>The real problem started yesterday.

That bang for buck compared to the sony is what makes it so difficult. Thing is he reaaaally doesn&#039;t give a shit about cameras on phones, and I feel like the performance difference is not really a big deal realistically either.

When an AI model generates data, it&#039;s essentially creating examples based on its own internal representations and understanding of the data distribution. If this generated data is used to train the model further, the model may become overly reliant on its own &quot;understanding&quot; of the data and may not generalize well to new, unseen examples.<br><br>For example, if you have an AI model that generates images of cats and you use these generated images to train the model further, the model may become overly focused on the specific details and patterns it has seen in the generated images and may not be able to recognize real cats that look different. This can lead to the model producing distorted or unrealistic images.<br><br>It&#039;s generally recommended to use a diverse dataset to train AI models, rather than relying on data generated by the model itself. This can help the model learn a more general and robust understanding of the data distribution and improve its ability to recognize and classify new examples.<br><br>Hope that helps clarify things!

First, null-terminated string representation doesn&#039;t allow accessing the length of the string on constant time. This is a very frequent issue in C, where many APIs will accept (char* str, int len). If you&#039;re going to include the length, though, (which you almost always have to do), the null termination is superfluous - you can know where the string ends by its length, saving a byte or word depending on alignment concerns.<br><br>Second, if you only track the length of the string and not the amount of memory allocated for the string, operations like &quot;reserve space to concatenate these strings&quot; become significantly more error prone, and in cases where you don&#039;t know how much you&#039;ll be appending to a string, you&#039;ll be forced to either track capacity out of band (like length in the previous example) or call realloc unnecessarily, just in case it actually needs to be reallocated.<br><br>Conveniently, both of these concerns are addressed by a common data type known as a &quot;dynamic array&quot; or &quot;vector&quot;. A vector is a pointer to the memory allocated for the array, the populated length of the array, and the allocated capacity of the array. Like in C, rusts String type (backed by a Vec), allows you to access the underlying memory with a single pointer dereference, but it also conveniently and efficiently allows inspecting and manipulating the string with the included length and capacity, and avoids the overhead (and extremely common source of out-of-bounds-read issues) of null termination.<br><br>When capacity is unneeded because you&#039;re handling a string which will not change length (such as a view into another string, or a constant), you can instead use the str type, which can be thought of as referring to the type of the arbitrary-length (not necessarily known at compile time) underlying array or region of memory backing the string, and thus is who&#039;s always referred to behind a pointer, &amp;str.<br><br>Tldr; C strings suck ass and OP is a dumbass who can&#039;t read Rust types.", "time": 1672528714, "resto": 90622351}, {"no": 90629250, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)18:21:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90629014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90629014</a><br>in fact heres code to demonstrate further<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">void __declspec(naked) fn()<br>{<br>    __asm<br>    {<br>        mov BYTE PTR [esp], 0x00;<br>        ret;<br>    }<br>}<br><br>int main()<br>{<br>    fn();<br><br>    return 0;<br>}<br></pre><br>(compile with msvc or ms extensions)<br>the above code modifies the return address which is on the stack; the OS doesnt actually give a fuck about executing that instruction by itself<br>its just that this will make fn return to some place where it shouldnt (most likely into breakpoint interrupt, especially if youre in debug mode) and that will cause further issues; but executing that instruction by itself, which is writing to the stack where it technically shouldnt (to the return address) will not cause an OS memory access violaton error or anything", "time": 1672528863, "resto": 90622351}, {"no": 90629349, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)18:27:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is pretty much the same shit you&#039;ll find in an std::string in C++ though. The only major difference is _marker, which is a zero sized struct used by the compiler for drop check analysis. It takes up exactly 0 bytes. So that leaves us 4 fucking things.<br><br>pointer : The fucking buffer where your string is stored. This is a heap-owned string. No shit you need a pointer.<br>cap : The fucking capacity. We want to be able to append characters at the end of the string cheaply. So we allocate more space than we need and only reallocate when we hit capacity. And we double every time we reallocate so we have amortized O(1) append. Learn some basic computer science, and you&#039;ll realize this is a good thing. <br>len : The goddamn length. Because only dumb retards want to get length in O(n) time by checking for a fucking zero byte at the end of a string. You are saving at most 7 bytes of space and making things so much fucking worse in terms of performance.<br>alloc : Not even part of the struct. It&#039;s data associated with the data type, saying what allocator we need to use to grab more heap memory from. Because some people might want to do that differently. Since this is associated with the vector type and not with the actual data in the vector, this takes up 0 bytes.<br><br>And the number one cost for compiling Rust is the code generator.

There are benefits to doing this, such as finding out what switches you prefer and not overspending on an item you may not even enjoy. However, chinkboards are often compromised in various ways. Some only take in a certain types of switches. Some have proprietary software to remap keys, and in some instances, do not allow certain keys to be remapped. And of course, the build quality and aesthetic feels cheap and ugly in chinkboards. Q1 and GMMK Pro are okay boards; they tick a lot of the enthusiast check boxes such as 5-pin hotswap sockets, QMK/VIA compatibility, gasket mount (not necessary), and of course a clean and inoffensive aesthetic.

If you want to make a career in software development, if you don&#039;t already have a degree you need to somehow show some demonstrable skill that you&#039;re capable to code.

It&#039;s tempting to get caught up in trends and focus on the latest and greatest xyz but in reality you&#039;re going to discover that all new tools eventually reinvent the wheel. Try to script and code as much as possible at your work. Show demonstrable skill that will make them want to promote you into a more software engineering role (though in reality helpdesk will lead you to sysadmin cuckoldry, best case is SRE). It&#039;s not bad advice to dabble in some open source projects and see how they do it. Interviews are really more or less leetcode and bullshit quizzes that are worthless in your day-to-day, so don&#039;t stress about that too much, but once you get comfortable with programming dive into data structures.

It doesn&#039;t get any simpler than that, and it can&#039;t really get any more complicated either unless your core language specifies an approach to encodings. All C specifies wrt encodings is that &#039;0&#039;-&#039;9&#039; must be single-byte, contiguous, and in-order for most standard-specified functions to work on them (reading any atoi will make it immediately obvious why), and later C99 or C11 added utf8 literals which is still just a list of bytes, it just specifies that said bytes must be encoded and decoded as utf8. Although actually ensuring that is mostly up to the programmer, and there&#039;s no in-language support for going from those bytes to a count of charaters. The standard also doesn&#039;t specify that the wide char types must actually represent Unicode code points, but I believe POSIX does. Point being there&#039;s no way for C to do strings wrong since it doesn&#039;t do anything.

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

For example, an AI system may be able to process and analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, but it may not have the ability to think creatively or experience emotions in the same way that a human being can. It is true that humans do not choose to experience emotions, but rather they are a natural response to stimuli. However, the ability to recognize and regulate one&#039;s own emotions is a key characteristic of intelligence and sentience. This means that being able to understand and manage one&#039;s own emotions is an important aspect of being intelligent and self-aware. While it is true that humans may not have complete control over their emotions, the ability to recognize and regulate them is a key characteristic of sentience. This does not mean that being &quot;out of control&quot; is a requirement for sentience, but rather that the ability to recognize and manage one&#039;s own emotions is a key aspect of being self-aware and conscious. It is important to recognize that the ability to control one&#039;s emotions and actions is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Even if someone has shown themselves to be &quot;out of control&quot; in certain situations, it does not necessarily mean that they are completely unable to regulate their emotions or actions.

Semantics -be it sensu stricto or sensu lato- carry a very important weight in any discussion, and AI discussion is certainly no exception. It is common for scientists to escape debate by taking shelter in sensu stricto definitions and limit the discussion to the technicalities of the concepts that they themselves developed. And that&#039;s precisely why I respect our friend&#039;s point. Why did we -or the scientists that invented it- specifically chose those two words to name it? If it&#039;s only a series of algorithms, chains of commands, black boxes, and whatever else you wish to include in the definition of AI, then any of their technically correct names would&#039;ve sufficed, but no. There&#039;s an intent -and a very clear one, if you asked me- to stirr the pot with the choice of those two words, and every time we hear them we cannot help but wonder: But what is intelligence, really? The question that our friend ponders before us and is a very philosophical one indeed, and probably impossible to answer but the boldness with which we chose and accepted that naming should imply that we have a very clear idea of what intelligence is. And yet, every time that a person brings the arguments of our friend to the table, all hell breaks loose. Experts start throwing jargon around, disregard for more intuitive opinions ensues, while AI enthusiasts depict their utopian future dreams, and ultimately everyone ends up a bit more annoyed at the opposition than before Why? Well, WE as a collective have accepted those ambiguous terms were appropriate, thus it&#039;s only natural that every debate around it is tainted by such controversy.

I mean, sure, a traditional notebook or digital document might seem like a perfectly good way to organize your notes and ideas.

This fancy German word translates to &quot;slip box,&quot; and it&#039;s basically a fancy way of saying &quot;a bunch of index cards with notes written on them that you throw into a physical or digital box and hope for the best.&quot;<br><br>But don&#039;t be fooled by the simplicity of this method - it&#039;s actually a revolutionary way of organizing your thoughts and ideas. And with tools like Obsidian and Logseq, the possibilities are endless.

There are a lot of idiots out there who think adhering to &quot;true Unix&quot; tradition means a bunch of shitty ncurses interfaces, but suckless is one of the few groups that really understands the appeal of Unix tools, because they&#039;re not shitty ncurses interfaces, and they&#039;re not even shitty, interactive CLI interfaces; Unix tools are one-dimensional. They&#039;re singular in there application, with no superlatives or quality-of-life features, and a pleasant side-affect of that is that they&#039;re light and pipe-able. Emacs works best as a frontend for software like that. Surf is somewhat neutered, so it depends on dmenu to sort of carry things from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;, something that what otherwise be poorly-implemented by the browser itself, like issuing search search queries and searching for arbitrary text, but the funny thing is, Emacs does precisely that, except better. I can interact with Surf via Emacs in precisely the same way dmenu is used to interact with Surf, and that simply wouldn&#039;t be possible if it weren&#039;t for suckless&#039; paradoxically humble elitism. Emacs loves simple applications, because it&#039;s easy to take something intentionally shallow and effectively create your own toolkit with Elisp.
