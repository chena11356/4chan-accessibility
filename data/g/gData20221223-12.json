The full, extended version of the post with more details is here. Please read that: https://rentry.org/f8peb<br><br>Matrixfag here. We&#039;ve set up a way for people to help build the data required to fine-tune larger models: a website in which chatlogs from CAI can be voluntarily submitted for the purposes of compiling a dataset. As said before, good data required to make a chatbot is hard to come by. With CAI logs, we can obtain a valuable resource to get Pygmalion-1.3B and beyond up and running.<br><br>The process required for sending data consists of 2 steps:<br>1. Scrape your CAI chatlogs and download it into a .json file. This is done through our CAI dumper userscript, which can be found here: https://git.fuwafuwa.moe/waifu-coll<wbr>ective/toolbox/src/branch/master/ex<wbr>tras/characterai-dumper<br><br>Be sure to go through your logs and check to make sure all PII is redacted. Pre-1.2 versions of the userscript may contain your CAI display name in the chatlogs due to a bug which was found only after it got out of the Matrix and put on /g/.<br><br>2. Go to https://dump.nopanda.io/ and upload your JSON files. Your data will be stored on a secure server and will not be touched until it is time to use them for fine-tuning.<br><br>We are planning to build and release a public dataset of conversations for the purpose of aiding others who may be doing a project similar to ours. More details in the extended post.<br><br>I realize that a post coming in and asking you to dump your data to a certain website may not be warmly received. Feel free to reply with any questions or concerns and I&#039;ll do my best to reply.<br><br>Thank you all for the support you showed for Pygmalion-350M&#039;s release!

I rebooted only to be greeted with another 10 minutes of nothing followed by something along the lines of &quot;An operating system couldn&#039;t be found&quot;. Not knowing what the fuck else to do, I just unplugged everything from the wall socket, couldn&#039;t think of anything after another 10 minutes and out of desperation tried to turn it back on only to be greeted with a usually quick and normal Windows boot as if nothing at all happened. I still haven&#039;t got a clue what happened or why it happened. Maybe it&#039;s because I only unplugged the system drive&#039;s power cable but not its data cable but I kind of doubt that was the reason.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A booted OS can overwrite the EFI filesystem and render others unbootable, as Windows does sometimes during feature upgrades, but the boot loaders don&#039;t normally interfere with each other.</span><br>So after installing Linux I should be able to find an entry called &quot;GRUB&quot; in UEFI alongside Windows Boot Loader that&#039;s already there right now, which won&#039;t be removed after installing GRUB?", "time": 1671637901, "resto": 90433347}, {"no": 90434111, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)10:51:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90433347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90433347</a><br>What are some good and fun distros to permanent install on a 128gb usb drive?", "time": 1671637906, "resto": 90433347}, {"no": 90434200, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)10:57:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90434109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90434109</a><br>Maybe don&#039;t try to use an alpha status Linux distro if you&#039;re a spastic who can&#039;t successfully unplug a hard drive.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So after installing Linux I should be able to find an entry called &quot;GRUB&quot; in UEFI alongside Windows Boot Loader that&#039;s already there right now, which won&#039;t be removed after installing GRUB?</span><br>Something like that yes.", "time": 1671638265, "resto": 90433347}, {"no": 90434283, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:03:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;90434197</span><br>LUKS container on a file", "time": 1671638624, "resto": 90433347}, {"no": 90435188, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:50:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90434111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90434111</a><br>You could do a pocket sized Arch install if you wish.

Even 0% is fine. Phones only discharge to 3.4V or so. Quite far from the actual damagingly low voltage. That would probably be below 2.8 or so. And it would need to be at such a low voltage for a while. And that probably barely happens anyway compared to a high voltage which it can stay at for a long time if you charge overnight.<br><br>My experience with the poco f3 has been good. I have consistently limited the charge to 80% or less sometimes. Generally picking a voltage of 4.10-4.20. I&#039;m sure I would have absolutely raped the battery in the past year had I not done this, because I use Android Auto.<br>From what I can tell it&#039;s very close to when I got it. SOH in the pic is kinda retarded because it hasn&#039;t really been allowed to charge to the factory max ever, so it can&#039;t really know. This is a rare full charge though, and it seems that the shadow counter shows slightly under the full charge capacity (4598) and is basically what went in during the last charging session. Specification is 4520mAh typical, so it&#039;s actually at 101% health possibly.<br><br>So yes it works, focus on limiting the top percentage way more than keeping it above 20%. And I think even a 90% limit, at whatever voltage that gets you will already at least double the life expectancy of the battery, so yeah if you have any option like that, just do it.

You fell for the biggest piece of audiophile bullshit in the world, that you&#039;re paying more money for better sound quality instead of the resulting placebo effect. You cannot tell me why the HD800S sounds better than any other headphones without it being nonquantifiable audiophile hocus pocus because all evidence points to frequency response being pretty much everything and there it doesn&#039;t standout. There is a near zero percent chance you could pick out the $2,000 ADI-2 from a cheap amp, or even a cheap motherboard with relatively low distortion, in blind testing. Nor could you pick out the $59,000 HE-1 from $150 headphones painstakingly EQed to sound the same to your ear, or vice versa because that works too.  <br><br>The most egregious flaws in FR are still pretty subtle. Research will tell us that mostly everyone will prefer one target over another target when listening to certain songs but it doesn&#039;t tell us if the difference is meaningful or if you would actually care either way. Even if we found a target that is 100% objectively correct and somehow works for everyone despite head-related transfer function it wouldn&#039;t sound that impressive during blind testing. It wouldn&#039;t change the biggest problem in the industry, which is that nothing mixed correctly because room size, shape, and treatment creates more variability than what is found between any two good speakers. This hobby sucks because no one wants to accept a harsh reality that would invalidate all their feelings and make them feel ashamed, they seek a religious experience that nothing can give them so instead they just pay more money and stick their head in the sand.

Active authentication is the process of continuously verifying a person\u2019s identity based on the cognitive, behavioral, and physical aspects of their interaction with the device. In this work, we consider several representative modalities including keystroke dynamics, mouse movement, application usage patterns, web browsing behavior, GPS location, and stylometry. We implement a binary classifier for each modality and organize the classifiers as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture. The decisions of each classifier are fed into a decision fusion center (DFC) which applies the Chair-Varshney fusion rule to generate a global decision. The DFC minimizes the probability of error using estimates of each local classifier\u2019s false rejection rate (FAR) and false acceptance rate (FRR). We test our approach on two large datasets of 67 desktop computer users and 200 mobile device users. We are able to characterize the performance of the system with respect to intruder detection time and to quantify the contribution of each modality to the overall performance.</span><br>So this guy&#039;s thesis breakthrough was that we should continually data-mine users and forcibly log them out if the botnet thinks their keystrokes look abnormal.

An interpreter can rewrite it&#039;s entire core and redefine every symbol and have equal or greater performance to how it started, whereas a compiled language gains 2-3 orders of magnitude speed in it&#039;s default state but slow exponentially as alterations are made to the core structure.

At best, certain parts of the language can be optimized and other parts left unrestricted but slower to reach a general compromise.<br>The upshot of this is that a highly effective compiler requires intimate knowledge of the language to function.

I&#039;ve been using it for a few years now and for the most part it works fine, but every now and then there&#039;s something that&#039;s just broken. Usually it will run if you put a compatibility layer called steam-run first in the command, but sometimes even that doesn&#039;t help in which case you can&#039;t just compile from source normally, you need to actually write a package declaration for the package manager and install it that way.<br><br>I struggle through because I think NixOS is really cool, but it&#039;s definitely more difficult than something like Arch and for very little benefit. Does have some nice features, for example I have one computername.nix file for each of my machines, which has a different include list, which all pull from the same folder on my NAS. For example the machine I&#039;m using as NAS doesn&#039;t pull in software.nix or display.nix, and my laptop and desktop won&#039;t pull in wireguard-server.nix and nas-server.nix, but they do instead get wireguard-client.nix and nas-client.nix. For example when I replaced alsa with pipewire, I only needed to make the change once, in a file I creatively called audio.nix, and then make sure it worked on one of my machines. Then I just included that file on the other machines, did a nixos-rebuild, and nix took care of fiddling with the configs for me.<br><br>It&#039;s basically got two use cases.

Started with Cherry Silent Reds (45g) then to Kailh Speed Silvers (50g) then to Kailh Box Silent Pinks (35g) and just recently got some TTC Gold Pinks (38g). Lighter switches are the best because they enable fast, accurate typing, though they do take some time to get used to. Lots of double or accidental entry will happen until you normalize the force needed to actuate, but in the end it will only make you a better typist.<br>I really like the sound of the Gold Pinks, but being a bit heavier than the Silent Pinks it did take a while to acclimate. Out of all the switches, though, I think I liked the Speed Silvers the best. I&#039;m almost willing to go back to them, but I don&#039;t want to purchase them right now just to put the rest of my switches to pasture forever. They&#039;re a bit heavier but way smoother, just feel good to type on.

Finding a job is like a job in and of itself and there&#039;s lots of inefficiencies in that. Employers are already using AI to screen applicants, and job boards are using AI to match people to jobs but this hasn&#039;t really helped people much if not cause more problems. An AI assistant could write your resume, improve it, and send it out to recruiters on your behalf and that alone would lift a lot of the burden on people but it&#039;s only half the equation. The other half would be an AI that sufficiently helps people navigate the interview and onboarding process as well and this is what filters a lot of people out of employment who are otherwise qualified. I&#039;ve seen a stat showing 80+% of autistic adults are either unemployed or underemployed simply because they&#039;re filtered out at the interview stage. There&#039;s also the issue of a mismatch of where jobs are located and where people who can work them live. Remote work can help with this but it&#039;s pretty much all scams and unreliable freelance work competing with the rest of the world bidding pay down to peanuts. There&#039;s nothing in principle preventing data entry from becoming a legitimate job again where it&#039;s peoples sole job just to click a button or tag an image to train an AI. This does actually exist but people are paid pennies per hour on microtask sites to do this and sometimes they don&#039;t even get paid because fraudulent orders go unchecked.

Not all drivers are made equal. I have similar-tuned drivers from different generations on that one iem I liked and the newer ones hiss -they hiss even more on bad sources (but doesn&#039;t on good 1&lt; impedance sources) and the loudest hummer on my collection. Although you can say it&#039;s probably that the older model doesn&#039;t hiss due to being burned in for like almost a year now. I doubt that to be the case though but still drivers acting differently might be generational issue.<br><br>Hissing could also be the case with unburned ceramic capacitors from the usb dac module but mostly it&#039;s an issue with how the pcb was built over DAC and over the dynamic driver&#039;s back pcb (over crowding and accidental jumps = crosstalk)<br>You really can&#039;t have the net crosstalk of your PC jumping over to your USB DAC - only the mains hum can jump anywhere and even wirelessly over a phone&#039;s sound recorder that it&#039;s used even by forensics.<br><br>PC Crosstalk over USB is impossible but it&#039;s possible to cause digital errors on a dac from a shitty PC with very high interference or when the USB dac actually works as passthrough (native usb c audio or microusb audio on phones like huawei or samsung) which means the crosstalk from all radios and the chip would get passed to the final audio output.

Well, spark notes version of the same thing I told him:<br><br>Most people know how to use Bitcoin or Ethereum.  Get a wallet--I recommend the Exodus wallet for a good user interface--which allows you to receive crypto for free.  You can also use it to switch between cryptos.  A *wallet* is separate from an *exchange*--despite what the exchange tries to tell you.  Wallet gives you control over your coins, exchange holds them for you and if the exchange goes belly up like FTX you&#039;re shit out of luck.  Use the exchange only as a gateway between crypto and cash, and that&#039;s it, don&#039;t store coins there--though they will make it very convenient for  you to do so.  KYC means Know Your Customer--aka the legal requirements the government places on an exchange.  It&#039;s illegal for them to let you turn crypto into cash or vice versa without collecting your ID and other personal info.  If you need to go from cash to Crypto and back with no KYC, you need to hit up your friendly local crypto libertarian nutjob to help.

There are websites out there to facilitate these types of transactions.<br><br>You might be able to make Paypal with a burner phone work, I don&#039;t know.  I don&#039;t use it.

The company on Wednesday announced a 10% workforce reduction, aimed at helping it weather a rapid drop in revenue.

Cloudflare is a government funded MITM that is one of the biggest programs by the NSA in their war on encryption. They couldn&#039;t break encryption, so for the next best thing they weaponized their bots and supercomputers to DDOS websites, creating an environment of fear, until people were willing to accept any solution that would make them feel safe and secure. This is where cloudflare came in, the NSA funded organization designed to insert itself in the middle of the HTTPS chain to bypass that pesky encryption so they could once again regain their espionage capabilities being weaponized by all citizens after the damage snowden and assange caused that led to wider spread encryption protocol adoption.<br>Do note that every single bit of my post is 100% factual and I WILL be proven right in the future.

Your bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy home with you, he\u2019ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your diseased, infected axe wound. You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it\u2019s going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight. Eventually it\u2019ll be too much to bear - you\u2019ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They\u2019ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth name, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a man is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably male. This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back.", "time": 1671770493, "resto": 90468294}, {"no": 90468456, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)23:46:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "get hype<br><a href=\"#p90468403\"

For sets they want the fast lookup.<br>- It&#039;s expensive to keep the order when elements are deleted. (AFAIK you&#039;d need a linked list to solve this, which would add a lot of overhead.)<br>Maybe they&#039;ll switch over some day, but there are downsides and the upsides aren&#039;t as strong as for dicts.<br>dicts becoming ordered enabled a few things: it meant that **kwargs (for argument unpacking) remembered the order in which arguments are passed, and it made dataclasses possible because you can now see the order in which the the names are declared (because under the hood a class is just a dict or two).
