Also, even once the process is one-click, gathering up a nice dataset of a few dozen photos is also not quite trivial, and requires a bit of common sense in terms of being able to look at an image and realise &quot;oh, my intended subject isn&#039;t really the focus of the frame here&quot; or &quot;this is blurry&quot; or &quot;having exactly one random watercolour of my character probably isn&#039;t helpful at all&quot; etc, even assuming you can get a nice one-size-fits-all for run settings.

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

I know I probably sound like a faggot right now but that has been my experience.<br>As a diagnosed ADD sperg who has eaten quite a bit of uppers over the years, here&#039;s the timeline of what&#039;s likely to happen. When you start taking them, you&#039;ll experience a honeymoon period of two days to two months, depending on personal brain chemistry. During that time, they will make you feel happier, more social, and more motivated. You may get used to the newfound positive feelings, but that period will eventually end.<br>Then you&#039;ll have two choices. You may recapture the honeymoon period by going against your psychiatrist&#039;s advice and escalating the dosage radically on your own. This is the start of an addiction cycle and these substances WILL FUCK YOU.<br>The other choice is to make peace with the fact that these are now just focus pills, a specific tool for a specific purpose. This is where I am now. I take them when I&#039;m having a very distracted day or need to do useful work in a distracting environment with people walking around and sounds that hurt me in the autism. Uppers make it much easier for me to ignore distractions but they don&#039;t bring me motivation anymore.<br>It&#039;s probably not that bad to just try uppers in reasonable doses for a few months, but if your problem is more emotional than just a distraction-prone brain, you might find it more useful to look into group therapy, changing your habits, or the antidepressants bupropion and fluoxetine.<br><br><a href=\"#p90730409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90730409</a><br>Yeah, Ritalin (methylphenidate) is one of the good ones, but it only lasts 3-4 hours.

I have a brand new RTX 4080 FE and I&#039;m having some issues crashing to the desktop while playing games. This occurs across various titles but seems to be more prevalent in titles that are more demanding. Ray Tracing seems to help increase the likelihood of reproducing the issue but the problem doesn&#039;t seem to be exclusive to RT titles from what I can tell. <br><br>Only thing I can see regarding the crash is picrel. I&#039;ve done some googling but I seem to be the only one on the internet with this issue on a 4080 and none of the solutions I&#039;ve found have helped. The title that the issue is most reproducible is Portal RTX. Here are some of the troubleshooting steps I have tried:<br><br>DDU Nvidia and AMD drivers and reinstall Nvidia drivers with the Clean Install option. <br><br>Changed the power management mode to high performance mode on Nvidia Control Panel<br><br>Ran a memtest with no reported issues (everything also works fine with my old 5700 XT). <br><br>Use Nvidia&#039;s clean software tool to clean the installation and reinstalled drivers with a clean install option<br><br>Booted Windows in Clean Boot mode with only the Microsoft and Nvidia services running to ensure no software conflicts<br><br>Reseated all power connections and verified everything is properly seated. <br><br><br>I haven&#039;t reseated the actual card into the PCIe slot yet and I haven&#039;t reinstalled Windows yet. Those are my next steps if I can&#039;t figure out a solution. I also haven&#039;t tried an older driver version since I&#039;ve been mainly using Portal RTX to test and it won&#039;t run without the current driver installed. I&#039;ve opened a case with Nvidia and their level 2 guys are having me try some basic troubleshooting so I&#039;m holding off on a reinstall until I do some of their troubleshooting.

First, let&#039;s bring up that claim of &quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;. This is usually not a statement made with regards to language choice. You probably should not write a program in language X if your end goal is to rewrite it in language Y.<br><br>This statement is instead typically made with regards to algorithm choices and micro-optimizations that have to be done by hand. What you want to do is first write an implementation that works. If it&#039;s not fast enough, profile the areas that are taking up the most amount of time and optimize them. Use better algorithms and data structures, and fine-tune the code to spend as little time as possible within tight loops, and so on.<br><br>For the statement that C is trash... this is true in a majority of cases. It&#039;s a language that&#039;s over 50 years old, and it still carries around a few design choices that make it easy to make mistakes in. It&#039;s also very minimalist, so you end up writing more code by hand. If you consider that every line of code one writes has a nonzero probability of generating a bug, then having a language that both requires more lines to accomplish the same task, AND has a higher probability of bugs per line, means you have a lot more bugs in general.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C C C C C SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED</span><br>This is true.

Then on the phone side usually cheapo $10 wired headphones that /CSG/ were shilled over the years and last 1.5 years some cheaper semi wireless headphones (JAM or JBL brand i believe) that were like $30.

Moving goalpost here. Compression operates on a window of audio, if RMS is low it boosts overall gain, if RMS is high it reduces the overall gain. No new harmonics introduced. By operating on multiple streams of audio(say, game audio and mic audio) it can mix both without exceeding set RMS - PREVENTING distortion. Special cases of this are ducking and side-chaining.

However, it is known that in the past, they were extracting the decryption key from vulnerable playback hardware. The DRM is designed such that the key should never be accessible to the user, like a TPM. But on the vulnerable device, they can get access to the key. In the case of the leak linked below, it was a Lenovo tablet that allowed the key extraction. Then once they have that key they can use it to decrypt the video outside of the DRM enclave. This works as long as Netflix doesn&#039;t ban all of the Lenovo X505X tablets.

Notes are the most troublesome part to write, everything else you can automate or program. You can use your MIDI keyboard for drums too, so a drumpad is not essential at first. The less things you have to deal with at the beginning, the faster you&#039;re gonna learn. You&#039;re gonna have to trust me on this one. DAWs and virtual synths are an endless rabbit hole, and it&#039;s better to explore them first -a lot- and then see what hardware you need for your specific goals instead of the other way around. If you reach a point where you simply can&#039;t live without an extra fader or knob, you can customize your controllers with exactly what you need for a cheap buck or maybe during your learning curve save money to get that fancy controller of your dreams. You&#039;ll probably change your mind a couple of times while you learn, maybe you decide that the computer is not enough and go for a hybrid or full DAW-less setup. Go very slow on the spending because if you don&#039;t have a clear goal and buy the wrong thing, it can get pretty frustrating. It&#039;s also overwhelming to have a lot of stuff that you don&#039;t use.

Anyway, the thing that got me less excited about MJ was actually using it for a month. It&#039;s a powerful model but the enforced house style is obscenely overdone, it&#039;s desperate to have a central model at the centre of the image (e.g. even prompting for a beach landscape it will DEMAND to put something like a big log or shipwreck in the centre of the scene) and overcoming that to do interesting other things is a huge pain requiring you to work outwards from square one every time you want to do it, tied in with this <a href=\"#p90736300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736300</a> issue. It&#039;s a bit like if you had to try to do all your SD prompting with (alphonse mucha:1.2) in positives, cancelling it out and making it do a photo / figurine / anime screenshot etc is just gonna be a headache every time. Feels more literally like perhaps having something like &quot;(model shoot:1.3), (highly aesthetic award winning composition:1.3)&quot; in positives though. You don&#039;t always *want* an award winning composition and you certainly don&#039;t always want a model shoot. So despite being the most powerful image gen currently available I got tired of it and went back to SD even while I still had half my month remaining (also the NSFW filter is a bit trigger-happy, but I knew that and wasn&#039;t making anything lewd with it anyway so it didn&#039;t affect my use of it much)", "time": 1672993246, "resto": 90735683}, {"no": 90736368, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:21:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90736361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736361</a><br>Amazing", "filename": "1672993258256", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672993260633946, "time": 1672993260, "md5": "b7qspZIy+8kN1ZLA/Ystxg==", "fsize": 371493, "resto": 90735683}, {"no": 90736380, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:22:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90736368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736368</a>", "filename": "Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts?", "ext": ".png", "w": 896, "h": 896, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672993342353840, "time": 1672993342, "md5": "ko12YnSjOzARKOCCEY9l2w==", "fsize": 1216414, "resto": 90735683}, {"no": 90736383, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90736333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736333</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;closed</span><br>lel", "time": 1672993360, "resto": 90735683}, {"no": 90736394, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:23:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90736315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736315</a><br>aztec skelly god is a cool prompt tho", "filename": "75524-4233492521", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672993422704711, "time": 1672993422, "md5": "a12Ckm5wbljLr1232hLLqw==", "fsize": 606622, "resto": 90735683}, {"no": 90736396, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:23:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90736362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90736362</a><br>That first picture looks awesome, very Valkyrie Profile-esque.
