That was how it was defined by Marx himself.<br>Socialism was defined by Marx as an economic system in which the means of production are owned by the state and granted to the laborers in co-operative fashion, with a supporting social safety net (such as subsidized/public healthcare and education, food stamps, subsidized/public housing, etc.) for said laborers paid for with taxation or the seizing of resources by the state for redistribution. This is the system that every so-called &quot;communist country&quot; in history has used, to varying extents. The Soviet Union, Mao-era China, Laos, Cuba, Venezuela, etc. They were all Socialist countries. The Soviet Union&#039;s ancronym, USSR, literally stood for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Marx said that Socialism only should be used as a stepping stone to Communism, and that Communism cannot be established without a baseline Socialist economy existing first. All the previous countries that were run by &quot;communist&quot; parties only called themselves the Communist Party because they claimed they were building to Communism eventually through Socialism, but Communism itself has never once been achieved in any of these countries because Socialism always fails.<br>Communism was defined by Marx as a stateless, classless, moneyless society where the means of production are owned democratically amongst the laborers in small communes, and goods are evenly distributed democratically amongst the members of each commune to provide a safety net for everyone. So basically, Communism is Socialism minus the government and minus a currency system, plus more democracy, which is why it is always funny that people who get Communism and Socialism confused end up calling Communism undemocratic when they really mean that Socialism is undemocratic (which it very much so is).<br><br>Dont call yourself a Communist if you believe in Socialism.", "time": 1676577620, "resto": 91557527}, {"no": 91581308, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:04:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91581234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91581234</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking I&#039;m about to read a 500-word essay about your thoughts on socialism vs communism</span><br>Leninism is based, and D&amp;C shills are not to be trusted.", "filename": "Lenin+based+his+rule+on+the+communist+ideas+of+Karl+Marx+and+Friedrich+Engels+and+later+had+the+Bolsheviks+change+their+name+to+the+Communist+Party.", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676577887574028, "time": 1676577887, "md5": "mq5ZLt+pjdywwz+Q2KWM3w==", "fsize": 136985, "resto": 91557527}, {"no": 91581335, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:06:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91558037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91558037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember, CERN has already harnessed the power of miniature black holes created artificially inside of the LHC.</span><br>Source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They&#039;re injecting them with tons of electrons to make a naked singularity.</span><br>That&#039;s not how it works retard<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are sending people through the singularity where space and time switch places to do literal time travel.</span><br>Also not how it works, brainlet.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CERN is evil</span><br>Good and evil are relative terms meant to scare gullible religiontards<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They will not perfect their time travel until 2034.</span><br>Source?", "time": 1676577974, "resto": 91557527}, {"no": 91581354, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:07:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91580314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91580314</a><br>so the anti-freedom chink-idolising leninist also whines about vaccines<br>it just gets better and better", "time": 1676578043, "resto": 91557527}, {"no": 91581367, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)15:07:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91581308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91581308</a><br>Those aren&#039;t &quot;my thoughts&quot;, those are Marx&#039;s thoughts, you fucking idiot.

I started from  the motif on the left. First, I duplicated it. Then, for variation, I added a note after each C/G.  Then, I transposed up C/G (which were the strong beats), adding tension, before descending back down to C. Do you noticed that at the last bar, it&#039;s a reversed, and C/G was switched? I wanted to do something called retrograde motion (which is flipping a motif) but I can&#039;t do that here and it sounds good. Just be aware of it existing. This is my thought process of the melody that is picrel<br>Melody is figuring out to convey an emotion and continue it. Here&#039;s some notes I made that I stole from another guy, all in plaintext https://files.catbox.moe/ds1ad7.md<br><br>The other parts to a song should build up around the melody. Harmony colors the melody, percussion gives it groove, production further colors the sound, etc etc. Good melodies help build good songs. And remember: a melody doesn&#039;t need to come from one instrument! It could simply a melody from mulitple instruments that weave in and out with each other. <br><br>For those, I don&#039;t need to go into as depth, due to their relative simplicy. Harmony is what notes are being played. A harmony can be played on mulitple instruments: this is why a violin quartnine  has four instruments. Drums can be alterted, but have the same basic patterns: just look those up lol. And bass lines are melodies that have rhythmetic focus. I suggest you start making songs using just a piano and drumset: no audio production work required. You can focus on composition, THEN expand to making songs in a DAW.<br><br>Finally, listen to music you like, transcribe it, and understand why you like it and how to do it yourself.

This allows for applying extra gain to the &quot;quiet&quot; sections of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping the &quot;loud&quot; sections. In other words: The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will &quot;even out&quot; the volume of quiet and loud sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves this goal *without* applying &quot;dynamic range compressing&quot;.

However, it has some annoying issues:<br>- standard library is pretty mediocre, and you&#039;ll have to implement many basic constructs in other languages&#039; standard libraries yourself. I see it mostly as a plus, but it&#039;s true that it takes more work.<br>- The compile time computations are extremely limited (or rather, they&#039;re not standarised and you can&#039;t control them very well, even though compilers do use them). This leads to annoying moments where you have to declare a constant as an enum, which is necessarily an int (in C23 we&#039;ll finally be able to choose the type of the enums).<br>- integers have confusing behaviour type promotion and their size isn&#039;t standard on all platforms. Very annoying for portability.<br>- some pretty common tasks that you do are technically undefined behaviour (integer over/underflows, struct packing, bit shifts over a certain amount). At the beginning of C, undefined behaviour just meant &quot;do the thing that makes the most sense on a specific architecture&quot;. Now, it means that the compiler can assume anything and introduce bugs that are VERY hard to find.<br>- A lot of very useful C features are compiler specific: GNU C really does make sense, especially for lower level and highly-optimised stuff, but you lose portability. Newer C standards port some of these things to C, but using them makes your code less portable as well.<br><br>Overall, it&#039;s one of the rare languages that let you control almost everything, and if you implement something in C, you actually do understand it. But it has some flaws that are due to it being the first one to matter for systems programming.

Because of the pigeon hole principle, we can&#039;t distinguish between eof and a byte value if we shove one of them into an unsigned byte. So either we mistake eof for a byte, or a byte for eof. Since eof is (usually) -1, casting to unsigned char will convert it to 255, which will be mistaken for the byte 0xff.
