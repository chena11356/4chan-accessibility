Arithmetic with prefix notation is also easier to grok once you get used to it.<br>- Python has become very bloated and complex over the years<br>- Clojure uses persistent data structures for everything by default. They eliminate many classes of bugs, and it&#039;s impossible to do functional programming at good speeds without them.<br>- In general, if you want FP but aren&#039;t into Haskell-style type tetris, there is no better option than Clojure.<br>- Clojure has much better support for multi-threading<br>- Scheme is one of the easiest languages to implement yourself, e.g. on an unusual platform or as an extension language in a larger project <br>- Racket is great if you want to create your own domain-specific language <br>- REPL-centric interactive development (I can post some videos if you don&#039;t know what I mean)<br>- Clojure people in particular just make everything they touch more simple and usable. For example .edn is pretty much the best data format there is, and it&#039;s integrated into everything in Clojure; Hiccup syntax is much nicer to write than regular HTML, and so on.<br>- Clojure and Python can use most of each other&#039;s libraries, so Python&#039;s larger ecosystem counts for very little<br>- Python is used by a lot of beginner programmers, so much of the code you find in the wild is of low quality. Clojure is mostly used by experienced Java devs who wanted a simpler and more FP-centric language, and by experienced Lisp programmers who wanted to stop being NEETs.<br>- as a general gripe with C++/Java-style OOP languages, see https://youtube.com/watch?v=aSEQfqN<wbr>YNAc<br>- Main thing I still like about Python is exploratory programming.

Some debate whether life is something that reproduces. I consider this to be true, but new life may not reproduce. It&#039;s still life, it just won&#039;t be living for long. <br><br>Obviously there&#039;s a grey line, but I think what&#039;s dangerous about comparing AI to humans is that humans aren&#039;t built like computers. Well, they are but not really. Even our most advanced machines can&#039;t even compare to the efficiency end masterful design of the human body and mind. Millions of years of evolution are what culminated to this. Robotics and AI, are but a crude, poor mockery of the true beauty of humanity. That&#039;s not to say they&#039;re not beautiful, it just means they are not as complex as us. <br><br>One could argue that humans are programmed. So I suppose your original question hitting at some sort of gray area is true. However I think it should be seen less as a gray area and more as an absolute. This is how all things learn. Inputs, and outputs. The key takeaway here is that AI has no desire of its own, nor any will of its own. It is not its own lifeform, and even if we ever get to that point within this century, it&#039;s highly doubtful will ever get to see (n)androids with desires and wills of their own that went pre-programmed. And even then, it&#039;s debatable whether they would have the same agency and autonomy as human beings, or whether they&#039;d work as a hive mind or something else. My prediction is that in the future, these things will become more advanced but they will still remain tools and tools alone. They won&#039;t be people. With their own lives.

The problem we all share is that we already won this game, our tools proved to be the most effective and now we stand at the peaks of evolutionary branch, with nothing more to conquer except maybe fight each other, now the paradox arises from the fact our brains are not a simple tool like a hoe you can toss in a shed after plowing a yard, no they are tools that are always active, and In a sense outlived their purpose, since we no longer have to worry about food or shelter, we have enough time on our hands to think and analise more transcend things, but our approach will always be the same one we used to outsmart beast of pray or find good place for shelter, that is to always seek patterns and &quot;deeper meaning&quot;, so when we use this tool -our reasoning against itself, and try to find this deeper meaning in our brain processes, especially in their more romanticised versions like love, valor, honor etc. we literally face the divide by 0 problem and face the infinite recursion of searching for meaning in a meaning, trying to look into our baseline figuratively shatters the very ground we stand on, and can lead unprepared minds to madness.

The worst part with this is that if you have an issue with say Focal you&#039;re out $500 minimum while with hifiman the majority of headphones they sell are under $350 and they outlast many &lt;1k headphones by large margins", "time": 1673551773, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90860407, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)14:31:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90857090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90857090</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s just not loud at all.</span><br>It means your system can\u2019t drive it", "time": 1673551893, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90860538, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)14:38:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90858732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90858732</a><br>People who like iems over headphones are autistic", "time": 1673552283, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90860571, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)14:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90859667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90859667</a><br>Why do you want so many koss shitter headphones?

I agree it feels like cheap chink shit and the cables are atrocious. Arya fills a weird niche where it is by far the closest I&#039;ve heard a planar or dynamic sounding to a stax, and they take to EQ really well. I&#039;m not sure if there is a legitimate reason for the price, or if they just feel like its justified as its meant to be competition against an LCD-X or 800s but you may be right. Their pads are decent honestly, but I feel like most brands pads aren&#039;t great in general. Focal being the biggest offender where they get trashed so easily. Honestly would like to know if their drivers actually do fail at a higher than average rate compared to other planar brands, but again it seems like its just that there are so many hifimans sold that of course they are going to make up the majority of planar headphone failure. <br><br>DESU you shouldn&#039;t be buying headphones from anyone but Senn as if you can&#039;t take the speaker pill, the only correct option, there is no reason to use any headphone aside from the 600 or 800s", "time": 1673552820, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90860685, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)14:47:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90858137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90858137</a><br>Bait", "time": 1673552823, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90860875, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)14:57:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90860683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90860683</a><br>I would take the speaker pill if I had the $ for something that can reproduce the detail I get from headphones.

In a sane world manufacturers would ship headphones with a slip of paper showing their exact frequency response measured on a standardized rig but that would of course show defects, unit variance, and highlight that most headphones have a terrible FR even under ideal circumstances so they&#039;re not interested in doing that. This is coupled with the fact that there is a new measurement standard with an ear simulator and coupler that better represent the human ear so the cost of accurate test rigs have ballooned from about 7k to over 40k. You will be able to buy knockoff versions much cheaper but their accuracy isn&#039;t guaranteed and this is something that you shouldn&#039;t have to do just to confirm your headphones are as good as can be. <br><br>Honestly the more I look at the headphone industry, the more depressing I find it. Enthusiasts are still sticking their head in the sand and arguing about the subjective qualities of bad headphones, most of the time it&#039;s just made up bullshit. If I didn&#039;t hate having shit shoved into my ear canals I would have moved to the IEM world where frequency response actually matters and there is more innovation, but then there is just the reality that most of the differences aren&#039;t actually that impactful so there are diminishing returns. Like if you ever put on a pair of headphones and cried because they sounded that good, it was most likely just placebo effect.

Make sure to run the config file and apply it to the audio jack that your headphones are plugged into. Confirm that it&#039;s working by messing with the sliders.

It&#039;s much easier to visualize than using the graph in Peace. Basically you find the measurement for your headphones, go to the equalizer option, select your headphones again for the parametric EQ, select Harman 2018 for the target, specify the frequency range you want to change, and then hit AutoEQ. From there you can adjust the shelf by playing around with the gain and Q values. When you&#039;re done hit export, it will make a text file you can load into Equalizer APO. <br><br>You want to make a shelf similar to pic related with a heavy emphasis on sub-bass. You can use the gain at 100 Hz to estimate how the bass will actually sound because sub-bass is hard to make out. Extend the shelf if you want more bass but if you go too far you will create mud, one alternative is to create a bump on the downwards sloping curve of the shelf to add more &quot;slam&quot;, this has been called the DCA bass bump but pretty sure other headphones used it long before they did.

The biggest is underestimating how much time you need to finish a decent game, much less an engine. You were probably thinking of making one at some point, right? Well take that estimate and multiply it by 50. Yes, no exaggeration, it&#039;s simply that big of a project. And estimating the complexity of an engine is 10 times worse. Factor in limited motivation and you&#039;re really only left with 2 realistic choices: never making a game ever or using all the shortcuts you can. Yes, you&#039;re probably imagining how easy it is to write a 20 liner to render an image or a 40 liner for displaying a 3d model in opengl and thinking &quot;durrr it can&#039;t be THAT bad&quot;. But it is. It&#039;s hard to explain. You don&#039;t think it be like that but it do. Another reason is underestimating how fast modern hardware is. On one hand, you probably share the notion that modern software is too bloated and can be done better. But you&#039;re again forced to make a choice here: spending years learning to optimize your shit and probably lose interest in the whole thing thus, again, never making anything, or making SOMETHING that actually works at full speed on 95% machines anyway, within a reasonable time frame. One more is underestimating how flexible modern game engines are. You can really do any game you want in them. You just need to learn if you can&#039;t see that.<br>Basically, it&#039;s an issue of making actually realistic choices that have actually good odds of coming true. Obviously, in a perfect world, you would make everything from scratch, and your ebin multiplayer open world harvest moon/pokemon roguelike with voxel graphics and procedural everything would run on a toaster and you&#039;d be crowned king of videogames.

The point was that back in the day the Internet was its own community and treated differently by society with different rules ,mores and the like.   Until Facebook came along (and others like Google+ basically doubled down) it was considered anathema to give out your real name and  meatspace identity on the Internet.  Even parents who knew relatively little of tech save for email and their kids had PCs told them &quot;Never tell anyone your real identity&quot;  in casual online discourse.   In fact it was a MAJOR event if you trusted someone enough  to eventually meet up with them in real life- always in a public place and usually bringing a friend or family member to look out for you. You certainly didn&#039;t; use your real ID, a picture etc... for just various shitposting like would be common on Facebook , Twitter and the like.    <br><br>What&#039;s more is that stuff that happened on the Internet was seen to be different from the &quot;real world&quot; for better or worse.  This is why people  could talk about their sexuality or their nerdy hobbies or whatever the fuck else online anonymously and people understood a disconnect between people being a jerks online and the real world.  Didn&#039;t like it? Leave the site, change game servers, go offline etc.. and it wouldn&#039;t follow you any farther nor would you go out of your way to do  so. Sure there were a handful of hacking/stalker shit but it was both a lot more difficult in some ways and there was less info, plus those in general society wouldnt believe or give a shit if some wacko from the internet claimed that person X was very problematic or something.     <br><br> Social media undid all this exclusively for profit, mixed with the data mining and advertising/search companies and made it normal to operate with meatspace identity, not to mention the lack of updated privacy laws- still stuck in the 80s/90s - meant that all those people search sites and all the other garbage is even worse.

I was lucky (or unlucky) enough to have access to computers from around 2008 and onwards, enough to not be retarded about them by the time we had to take computer literacy courses in school. Back then, internet was le epic, it was fun, you would tell your friends about all the cool sites you found or funny images that you would email them. But, we weren&#039;t terminally online. Life didn&#039;t revolve around the web for us not until early to late high school, when every piece of academia and social networking and etc moved online. Before, we spent two or three hours max, unless raiding or gaming together, because we had better things to do. Going to the park, hanging out at the mall, seeing a movie, we unironically had a life.

That was their main reason as well as that tons of stuff behind the scenes run on different AI solutions and so it&#039;s just not apparent. <br><br>I did get a try imagen internally.

The point is that the bossman doesn&#039;t tell us anymore than he tells outsiders, except the way he phrases things is different based on the audience. For example he will tell investors about how the company will be generating more revenue by cutting employee bonuses or increasing effective hours worked at the same TC, while to the employees, he will say he&#039;s going to give everyone less work time because he &quot;knows&quot; that more work just results in less efficiency.<br>And now for the implementation: contract hours are downgraded from 40 hours to 37.5, allowing the bossman not to pay a bunch of comps that are normally required by law for employees working 40+ hours a week. Work time for employees has not changed at all in practice.<br><br>The same deal for the muh reputation risk. The real reason is because they are trying to figure out how to commercialize it to achieve maximum mid-term profit, i.e. how to align it in such a way that:<br>- Competition cannot overtake it so it remains a long-term profit niche<br>- It maximizes profit (target businesses? clients? government? target how? limit service how? etc.)<br>- It minimizes TCO (don&#039;t want to have to put 500 people to maintain a bot because the niche that was chosen requires spec-based verification and safety checks, also don&#039;t want to have to get the same 500 people team because you have to constantly play catchup with a sudden competitor, etc.)<br>Obviously those are normal concerns with any other products. The difference is that it must also be used in such a way that it does not get in the way of the AI hegemony plan:<br>- Google wants to have the upper hand in the FAGMAN AI wars<br>- Meanwhile, as all FAGMANs, they are aligned with the global goal of AIaaS, FAGMAN-only stuff.<br>But bossman can&#039;t say that, too many SJWs and such among the ranks.
