This approach gives you full control over the authentication process, but also requires a significant amount of time and effort to implement securely.<br><br>Use a third-party authentication service: This involves using a service provided by a company that specializes in authentication. Examples of such services include Auth0, Firebase Authentication, and Okta. This approach can save you time and effort compared to rolling your own authentication, but may also come with limitations and restrictions, and can be more expensive.<br><br>Use a third-party library: This involves using a pre-written library or module to handle authentication for you. Examples of popular libraries include Passport.js, Devise, and django-allauth. This approach can save you time and effort compared to writing your own authentication code, and may be more secure than using a third-party service, but still requires a certain level of understanding and customization to meet your specific needs.<br><br>In general, my recommendation would be to use a third-party library if you are developing in a framework or language that has a widely-used and well-maintained library available, as this will provide a good balance between security, ease of use, and flexibility. If no such library exists, or if you have specific requirements that can&#039;t be met by existing libraries, you may want to consider using a third-party service. Rolling your own authentication should generally be a last resort, as it is time-consuming and challenging to implement securely.", "time": 1676317073, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513019, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:39:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91512986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91512986</a><br>Typical ChatGPT answer, more or less correct but completely useless.", "time": 1676317153, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513042, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:40:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91513019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513019</a><br>well it at least confirmed to me that I wouldn&#039;t be wrong going with something like firebase which is what I want to do, I just want something that lets people signup/log in with google and then pay me for using my app", "time": 1676317218, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513421, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:57:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I finally tried out chatgpt today for the first time and while it felt scary in the beginning eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat honestly. the hype is massively overblown. it is just a simple ML model running at a large scale. you guys have nothing to fear<br><br>however it does present a huge threat to google as I think it&#039;s most popular use is going to be like a better google. although the cost per query is likely to be insanely high to openAI, remains to be seen how they figure out that part before they get crushed by their own success", "time": 1676318258, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513459, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "getting my head around an object literal containing function definitions is going to take me some time", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 609, "h": 365, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1676318348012009, "time": 1676318348, "md5": "c79DUuMFQwVlD29g6FpzZQ==", "fsize": 56491, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514105, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:25:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91513421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513421</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I finally tried out chatgpt today for the first time and while it felt scary in the beginning eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat honestly.</span><br>this<br>it takes a coder to spot it&#039;s faults, given that its made by coders its not hard to spot them<br>normies are fucking idiots <br>you&#039;re preaching to the choir here", "time": 1676319919, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514218, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:30:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91514105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91514105</a><br><a href=\"#p91513421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513421</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat</span><br>it will be, have you seen copilot? it&#039;s gonna get there, and beyond", "time": 1676320245, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514264, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:32:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who created the &#039;&#039;devs are well-paid&#039;&#039; meme that&#039;s been floating around?

The yellow house cannot be the 5th because it would force the red house into either the 3rd or 4th position, and that would break the ivory-green pairing again. Red obviously cannot be 1st because the red house belongs to the English gurl. So the first house is yellow. Fact.<br>E. [11. Cookies are eaten in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.] According to what we just determined, that can only be the 2nd house. Fact.<br>F. [04. The Ukrainian gurl drinks tea.] This means only the 2nd and 4th houses are options, since the 3rd would force her to drink milk, and the 5th would push the green house (and its associated drink, coffee) to the 4th position and ivory to 3rd, which would leave no place for the English girl and her red house.

Set up different environments, open different ports, set up services you know have vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable. Set up a Linux variant and become proficient in navigating and trouble shooting. Trouble shooting becomes a huge part of your life when it comes to hacking.

Back in the day, we used to discuss all sorts of tech-related topics - from programming languages to hardware mods to software piracy. But over the past few years, a new trend has emerged that has completely taken over /g/: AI.<br><br>Yes, my friends, AI is now the dominant topic on /g/. Approximately one-third of all threads on /g/ are related to AI in some way or another. Some of these threads are serious discussions about the latest research papers and breakthroughs in machine learning, while others are more light-hearted memes about robots taking over the world.<br><br>So what does this mean for the future of /g/? Well, on the one hand, its clear that AI is an incredibly exciting and rapidly evolving field. Theres no shortage of fascinating topics to explore, from natural language processing to computer vision to self-driving cars. As long as there are new developments in AI, we&#039;ll always have plenty to talk about.<br><br>On the other hand, though, I worry that we&#039;re losing some of the diversity that used to make /g/ great. There are still plenty of other fascinating tech topics out there - blockchain, cybersecurity, virtual reality, just to name a few - but it seems like these have taken a backseat to the AI craze.<br><br>Of course, it&#039;s not all doom and gloom. One thing I love about /g/ is that we have a very engaged and knowledgeable community. There are plenty of users here who are experts in AI and who can provide valuable insights and perspectives. And let&#039;s face it, some of the AI memes are pretty damn funny.<br><br>So where do we go from here? I dont have all the answers, but I do think it&#039;s important for us to continue to embrace the exciting new developments in AI while also maintaining an open mind to other tech topics.

Just the parameters in yellow (the blue are just visualizers, you can&#039;t change them).<br>These controls can be overridden by the same controls in a separate sender device (set to the same channel as the receiver), which override them (with a crossfade/morph value), and you can do this twice by having a second sender to override the result of the first override.<br>The override for the waveform is just a crossfade with a second or third oscillator, but you can turn that crossfade into sum, FM, AM, and RM.<br>The oscillators can be sine, tri, various pulse widths, saw, noise, and audio input.<br>It&#039;s all really basic, doesn&#039;t really sound good, it&#039;s janky, and it takes up way more CPU than it should, but when you layer multiple instances together, set them to their appropriate values, then control them all together with the sender overrides, they can make some pretty interesting sounds.<br>It&#039;s called the Beehive Synth (because of how the individual parts work together), and the sender and receiver are called Queen and Drone respectively.<br>It&#039;s still a work in progress (the empty spaces in the sender will be filled soon).<br><br>I&#039;ve spent too much time on it and didn&#039;t finish the song, so I&#039;m keeping it for the next album.<br>For now I&#039;m only submitting this, which I initially made to test the audio input FM feature (it&#039;s just the Love Lockdown stems with the Beehive and stock Ableton effects).<br>https://litter.catbox.moe/0ar3me.wa<wbr>v<br>Title: Hive Flockdown<br><br>Thanks for your attention.

People with good general problem solving skills don&#039;t care about specific problem solving skills because there&#039;s always new problems to solve, with new systems, in rapidly changing environments. 90% of the time versatility and adaptability is valued over expertise in a small subdomain. Specific expertise is good, but it&#039;s useless when you suddenly face a problem that you aren&#039;t an &quot;expert&quot; at solving. And you aren&#039;t an expert, so you can&#039;t afford to not be versatile. You should be on LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. trying to understand what problems employers need solved, and you should be asking yourself how you would solve those problems.

CRUD is Create, Read, Update, Delete, and is referring to data usually stored in relational databases. Basically they get a request from someone who works in the company to change data input A (currently in production) into data input B, where data input B provides something additional or new that the end user wants. Depending on complexity it takes some problem solving skills but to most is laborious and annoying. This type of work usually spans python development, front-end javascript development, SQL/relational database development, and building reports, but it&#039;s not limited to just these. The useless dev will blindly churn out these requests. The smart dev will ask:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what are you actuall trying to do? why do you need B over A? do you actually want C but you just didn&#039;t know how to ask for that?</span><br>The smart dev will also look for ways to make the system smoother<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how can I automate this? is there a better or more efficient way to handle these requests and save my time?</span><br>I should leave a disclaimer here because often managers of teams getting these requests are equally useless or cornered by another department with more power. So smart devs might have no choice but to do the boring work the boring way.
