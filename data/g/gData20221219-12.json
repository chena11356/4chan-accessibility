This feature is still being actively developed by the Windows kernel team (e.g. they added write support a few months ago)<br>- Texture data for games is almost always stored on disk in a compressed format (e.g. zlib), which is different than what is required in DirectX in-memory buffers, so there is an unpack and translate process. This is entirely a CPU-bound operation.<br>- XBox Series S/X have custom silicon which is used by XBox&#039;s implementation of DirectStorage to improve loading times; this handles the texture unpacking process. (PS5 has similar custom silicon but obviously it&#039;s not DirectStorage)<br>- RTX 30 and RDNA2 GPUs today do not have this custom silicon. Therefore, do not expect big performance improvements on any current hardware when games like Forspoken come out.<br>- AMD has announced Smart Access Storage for Radeon 7000, which will include similar custom silicon.<br>- NVidia has not made a similar announcement. They did announce RTX IO a couple of years ago, but it never materialized and is currently not compatible with DirectStorage.<br>- Intel has not said anything about Arc Alchemist supporting DirectStorage, either.<br>- Without this hardware-level support, most of the potential benefit of being able to transfer data directly from an NVMe SSD to GPU is lost.", "time": 1671451819, "resto": 90385789}, {"no": 90389464, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:11:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389429</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le funny Photoshop</span><br>Good one anon.", "time": 1671451880, "resto": 90385789}, {"no": 90389519, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:15:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389403</a><br>I have a BMI of 17,5 so I doubt that.", "time": 1671452148, "resto": 90385789}, {"no": 90389527, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:16:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389455</a><br>It&#039;s actually really annoying that companies don&#039;t support things Microsoft brings to the table citing platform independence, but actively refuse to support Linux.

In asm, a &quot;function&quot; is just the memory address where its execution begins. A stack frame is often actually constructed on the frame, although sometimes it&#039;s in memory and the address of the frame is on the stack instead.<br>Second, the two related ideas to your post are: CPS and threading (in the interpretation sense). Continuation-passing style involves &#039;never returning&#039; from a function, instead if your result is &#039;valid&#039; you apply the &#039;accept&#039; function you received as input to the value you&#039;re &#039;returning&#039;. Otherwise you apply the &#039;fail&#039; function you received as input likewise. This allows implementing things like backtracking pretty succintly, but overuse of CPS makes code total spaghetti. CPS conversion is a common AST transformation step in functional languages.<br>Threading is basically similar, but instead of using a provided function for fail and succeed (that end up stacking as you proceed during execution), you instead insert a bit of glue code that points to the next function and jumps instead of returning from the current function.", "time": 1671419457, "resto": 90380761}, {"no": 90383431, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:12:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90383385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90383385</a><br>Convex hull ought to do it.

Videos are harder, and the current versions made by Google are still fucking miserable and won\u2019t just magically improve as easily.

Now imagine games that have to be coded bugs-free, have to be cohesive, have to have story and be fun to play and playable. AI will have to figure out how to play test every kind of game out there, learn how to make it fun and also learn how to write long code projects.

And not to even mention that the training of those models with human feedback would be fucking impossible. Good gameplay is more subjective then different artstyles, where one gameplay can be masterpiece to some and the worst thing to another, unlike with pictures where good shading and no technical errors automatically make the picture 5+/10. Recognising if picture is shit takes you 0.5 seconds and 2 seconds to see if it is great, cans say the same for games. Just because one creative thing got potentially automated does not mean all creative fields are now on the chopping block one by one. Either AI won\u2019t learn how to make videogames, or the world will be too fucked to make your cousin worry about games being automated.", "time": 1671427918, "resto": 90383300}, {"no": 90385250, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:35:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90385178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90385178</a><br>This existed for 3 or so years.

Fix all the keywords that were renamed for no reason: &quot;match&quot; = &quot;switch,&quot; &quot;let&quot; = &quot;auto,&quot; &quot;()&quot; = &quot;void,&quot; and so on.<br>7. Replace the stupid &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator with real case labels so IDEs can actually highlight them.<br>8. Make mutability the default. Use explicit const for immutable variables and references.<br>9. Put the type before the variable, not after.<br>10. Remove the pointless &quot;fn&quot; keyword. It&#039;s redundant.<br>11. Put template parameters before the associated declaration instead of mixing them in with a bunch of other stuff where it&#039;s impossible to read.<br>12. Change &quot;self&quot; back to &quot;this&quot; and make it implicit.<br>13. Struct fields should be defined with the same syntax as declaring variables.<br>14. Remove &quot;impl Bar for Foo.&quot; You should be able to see all the interfaces a type inherits from at the declaration site.<br>15. Remove &quot;impl Foo.&quot; Methods should be defined inside the struct body, or declared there and defined at the top level.<br>16. Make parentheses mandatory in if/while/for statements. Make braces optional.<br>17. Bring back the three-part for loop syntax. There are things that simply can&#039;t be expressed without it.<br>18. Make lifetimes completely invisible.

To understand why something coming back from a function calls needs to be borrowed or dereferenced or how it should be used in general is very hard to figure out. You have to crawl through many docs pages and traits and implementations and auto trait implementations to figure out why some generic object that you get back from an iterator is *T&amp; instead of T&amp; or whatever. I&#039;m not an expert in Rust yet but you get the point. <br>The language was unfortunately designed in a way that doesn&#039;t care about this, they wanted magical generics and they got it and it&#039;s bad for everyone else now who has to read code written by others. I already suggested to some of their people that it could be okay if their rust-analyzer gives me back a tree of decisions why a type ended up being that type. Because it is in fact a tree that the compiler walked down in order to make that T into some specific T, even at compile time.<br><br>the issue is that Rust people don&#039;t want to admit that all this complexity is dangerous. Fixing memory safety is worth a lot but adding complex 3rd party libraries that I can&#039;t read and understand quickly is also dangerous. Very dangerous.

It genuinely takes minutes to figure it out.

Anyway, AI art might be able to imitate soul or stories, but it will still remain soulless eye Candy until you put some mind behind the work.

Somebody is on trial because camera saw them? Just claim the video was made by AI. Somebody on social media records a crime scene? AI did that too. The whole heavily subsidised movie industry being threatened? Again, more reasons to regulate. People finally realising they have been lied to and that AI is going to actually replace all the smart and educated people instead of the lowly workers? Yeah, total collapse of public support.

I believe the answer to the question of why people are posting low quality images is quite simple. Your average horse enthusiast loves to exhibit their images as works of art, or sketches if you will. Generating AI artworks doesn&#039;t require a lot of time, so we can treat the close-finished images as sketches and present them to the greater audience.

It is a pile of open hardware with a phone modem attached and I&#039;m making a Maid Phone with it. Originally I wasn&#039;t going to get one at all, because I imagined it as a big graphing calculator and I don&#039;t have a use-case for that. Then people kept posting it and someone called it &quot;freetard blackberry&quot; and that made me think what if it is a phone for maids? It has nice properties for a phone, like not having a mic or a camera built in and having hot-swappable batteries (The Writing Computer has this ability, I assume the Maid Phone will too) and having a physical keyboard instead of a touch screen. So I am working on Maid Phone software now. The Maid Phone will have Maid Parade Emergency Maidposting System, Kurumi MaidCard and an MP3 player. SD cards are super huge now with like 32 gigs being cheap and the Maid Phone software is going to be really small (and CC0 compile-it-yourself, distributed as uncompiled source only, by Maid Card) and it has a 3.5mm audio jack, so you should fill up the rest of the SD card with mp3s.<br><br>As far as writing code on a non-standard keyboard, this doesn&#039;t bother me. My science computer is a GPD Win 3, so I am used to coding on a non-standard UMPC keyboard anyways. You get used to non-standard keyboard after a short time, if you like the device and use it enough.
