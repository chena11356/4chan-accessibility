But the problem is also because the phones naturally lasts ~4-5 years normally anyway, so there&#039;s no need to make a law to force companies to create parts for old phone parts that become irrelevant anyway. All it does is create extra costs to manufacturers, slow down innovation cycle, increase cost for users, reduce profit for shareholders, etc. Its a massive net negative all around, just so some people can have parts for old smartphone parts that are no longer relevant. Furthermore, with companies focusing on innovation/advancements as they produce better/faster phones with more/more features, the issues regarding repairability becomes irrelevant anyway due to better/better phones thats have safer/better/durable/stronger features. <br>Each generation of phones have better and better screens that resist damages to the phones.

For gaming, Linux Mint or Windows do work well. Only do gaming on there. For work, have whatever you need, depending on the software. Whatever doesn&#039;t have to be online, keep it offline. Pull the ethernet cable, detach the networking card inside the computer.

I wanted to bring to your attention some serious security concerns with the internal customer and records management system that we are planning to move to the cloud.<br><br>As I&#039;m contracted here to work on the codebase, I have identified the following problems:<br><br>1. Half of the endpoints are not restricted to authorized users, which poses a significant security risk.<br><br>2. A lot of the logic is currently done client-side, which could make the system vulnerable to tampering, data manipulation and access of privileged data.<br><br>3. There is a potential for SQL injection, which could lead to data breaches and the exposure of sensitive information.<br><br>4. The system contains a wealth of employee and customer personal information, including Social Security numbers, and if this information were to be leaked, it would have serious consequences.<br><br>I believe it is imperative that we address these security issues before we move the system to the cloud. I would be happy to work with the development team to find solutions to these problems and ensure that the system is secure before we make the transition.<br><br>Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>[Your name]", "time": 1675248583, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266542, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:58:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266411</a>", "filename": "1613075249348", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 219, "h": 254, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675249096905793, "time": 1675249096, "md5": "4oCjg7qjOiGeQaufaLFX/A==", "fsize": 8158, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266669, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:13:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266464</a><br><a href=\"#p91266452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266452</a><br>They already know.

Once there&#039;s nothing more to read it returns 0. You should get rid of that <pre class=\"prettyprint\">BUFFER_SIZE</pre> and replace it by what <pre class=\"prettyprint\">fstat(2)</pre> tells you what the file size is, then use that size to allocate the entirety of the file into a single buffer. (You&#039;ll probably get bonus points if you use <pre class=\"prettyprint\">mmap(2)</pre> instead of <pre class=\"prettyprint\">malloc(3)</pre> but beware that <pre class=\"prettyprint\">mmap(2)</pre>&#039;s semantics are completely different than that of <pre class=\"prettyprint\">malloc(3)</pre>&#039;s.

It was obvious they were going to do this when they cut their TSMC order last year. AMD can either reduce prices and take the opening or play the same game and get more money per card too. They chose to do the latter. Eventually, consumers holding out are going to give in and buy if AMD and Nvidia can last long enough, which I think they will. Of course there has been a nose dive in demand, but that&#039;s relative to already historically high demand.

He believes that there are still half a dozen insights needed to be discovered in order to reach AGI. He is exploring different ideas and techniques and trying to merge them to build AGI. He is following mainstream research but is also looking into older research from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s that might have potential. He is building small experiments, playing video games and watching television to understand perception and agency, which he considers key pieces of the AGI algorithm. He has raised $20 million but wants to work on these ideas for a decade before scaling and spending large amounts of money. His ultimate goal is to create a conscious being that can learn and be studied by developmental psychologists, scientists, and engineers.

It is true that a lot of the DNA is not vital, which is sometimes termed &#039;functional&#039;, therefore evolutionary speaking, mutations can only happen in viable individuals on specific areas of the genome for further reproduction. Ignoring this leads to things that result in this very entertaining paper:<br>https://academic.oup.com/gbe/articl<wbr>e/5/3/578/583411<br>However, vital and functional is not the same thing. For example it&#039;s well-known that cryptic peptides (e.g. those that do not derive from introns) are a major constituent of the healthy immunopeptidome, which is a central component to immune response (self vs non-self determination) by the adaptive immune system (for example, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/276<wbr>47836/<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/247<wbr>06797/<br>or<br>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/f<wbr>ulltext/S2211-1247(21)00129-7?_retu<wbr>rnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.else<wbr>vier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS221112<wbr>4721001297%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)<br>Is this function or not? According to the meme 1970&#039;s understanding of these things, this is *NOT* function and thus the DNA encoding those proteins are &quot;non-functional&quot;.<br>Another example: it is well-known also that there is complex interaction between peptides, proteins, RNA, and the cell environment. Among others, it&#039;s known that some proteins can only exist when part of the rna is suppressed by other molecules and vice versa.<br>https://www.frontiersin.org/article<wbr>s/10.3389/fendo.2018.00402/full<br>In summary, there is no evidence that there really is &quot;non-functional DNA&quot;. It&#039;s just that the function of a sequence may be on another level than just as an encoding as per the central dogma (long refuted by the way).", "time": 1675302220, "resto": 91278342}, {"no": 91280969, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:46:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Latest news, John Carmack of Quake fame makes sex bot AI.<br><br>More news at 11.", "time": 1675302404, "resto": 91278342}, {"no": 91283127, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)23:21:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91279294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91279294</a><br>Thanks.

Shows like &quot;K-On!&quot;, &quot;Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions&quot;, and &quot;Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World&quot; are criticized for their shallow character development, predictable plots, and fantastical elements that lack any real connection to the audience.<br><br>This is a far cry from the sophisticated and cool anime that was popular in the 80s, such as &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, and &quot;Patlabor&quot;. These shows pushed the boundaries of animation and storytelling, and explored complex themes and emotions. They were not afraid to tackle mature subject matter and offered a depth of experience that is often lacking in today&#039;s anime.<br><br>It&#039;s time for anime to rediscover its roots and once again become a place of creativity, depth, and sophistication.

Last batch I improved by reordering my prompts, this one I further improved by removing most of my commas.<br><br>Since removing commas for all tags or terms in the same parentheses and keeping the prompts the same otherwise, my immediate observation is that my positive prompt terms are more present, more robust, and generally stronger for the same listed strength. It&#039;s too early to tell for certain, but the AI doesn&#039;t seem to struggle to understand that every term separated by a space in the parentheses still gets the weight listed at the end.<br><br>However, some of my negprompts actually seem weaker. Men and dicks are showing up where they&#039;re negprompted to 1.4 with synonyms. This might mean that it actually does get confused without the parentheses sometimes? I&#039;m not sure.<br>Has anyone else found this to be the case? I&#039;ll just bump negs for now and maybe add a few commas back in, or trim down my negprompt a bit overall. Maybe make a few of my posprompt tags a bit weaker too.<br><br>An interesting thing I noticed with the tokenizer extension is that commas are always just their own token, but spaces seem to always be attached to the word or phonic they proceed.<br>If I understand it right, it&#039;s not programmed that way, the AI itself decided on the tokens during training.

Domain Specific Language \u2013 Lisp is often used to create Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), which are highly specialized programming languages that are tailored to a particular task or domain.<br><br>4. Notation for Metaprogramming \u2013 Lisp has a powerful notation for metaprogramming, which allows for a high degree of programmatic control over the behavior of a program.<br><br>5. Macros \u2013 Lisp has an incredibly powerful macro system, which helps developers write code faster, by abstracting away common tasks.<br><br>6. Power \u2013 Lisp is incredibly powerful and can be used to solve a variety of problems.<br><br>7. Garbage Collection \u2013 Lisp has an in-built garbage collection system, which protects against memory leaks and other common issues.<br><br>8. Libraries \u2013 Lisp has a vast array of libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to reduce the amount of code they need to write.<br><br>9. Reflection \u2013 Lisp allows for powerful reflection capabilities, which makes debugging and performance tuning much easier.<br><br>10. Portability \u2013 Lisp code can be easily ported to other platforms, making it a great choice for distributed systems.", "filename": "1675329061451", "ext": ".png", "w": 811, "h": 805, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1675329087985630, "time": 1675329087, "md5": "idmGy1gWAsFhhZYul34FCQ==", "fsize": 29524, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "10-reasons-why-common-lisp-is-the-most-powerful", "replies": 9, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 91286947, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:51:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Nice SEO article", "time": 1675331460, "resto": 91286505}, {"no": 91287179, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:15:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "11. standardization - lisp has two standards meaning that it is a mature language with concrete goals and designs with a multitude of compilers that are cross compatible<br><br>12. approved for military use - in the 1980s the department of defenfe determined common lisp and ada to be suitable for advanced military contracts<br><br>13. implementability - there exist lisp systems so small that they are very easy to implement. this gived the user a better understanding of how computer languages operate<br><br>14. speed - although not the fastest language, lisp is a suitably fast language for general purpose use<br><br>15. reversibility - common lisp supports purely reversible computing so that it can be run on a quantum computer and take advantage of quantum speeds, unlike most other languages that do not support it and thus are not able to take advantage of quantum speeds<br><br>17. legacy - lisp is among the oldest languages even older than c<br><br>18. immutability - common lisp and scheme support immutable programming which eliminates race conditiond and allows code to take advantage of multiple cored without memory locks or mutexed<br><br>19. json-like - the syntax of lisp is nearly exactly like json.

You can also, y&#039;know, do something like<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">$ git clone https://github.com/person/whatever<br>$ cd whatever<br>$ git submodule init<br>$ git submodule update<br></pre><br>I mean, on Debian systems, for example, adding other repositories involves wget-ing the repo&#039;s GPG key, adding the repo by echoing into /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whatever, and then installing the program now that you&#039;ve updated apt&#039;s sources list.<br><br>There are countless other package install systems, too, other than the apt or pacman or dnf or emerge or whatever comes on your system. Snapd (I know), Flatpak, AUR, etc.<br><br>I agree, though, that standard install from a .exe or a .dmg can have some benefits over a package management install (this is essentially what a .deb is, and more broadly what e.g. a .flatpak or .AppImage is). I&#039;ll also admit that it does create some problems for deprecated programs. I&#039;ve had issues with ungoogled-chromium on Debian systems, for instance. I prefer this way, though, and for a couple reasons.<br><br>Mass-updating every program without needing auto-updaters in the background for every program is very nice. Not having a cluttered Downloads folder is very nice. Being able to install multiple programs at once is very nice, and being able to cleanly uninstall or purge a program without needing a custom uninstaller program or messing with Add or Remove Programs (lol) is very nice. On my W10 box, Bitdefender is still in a state of purgatory, where I can&#039;t install or uninstall it, due to a botched uninstall.<br><br>There are tradeoffs with everything, but let&#039;s face it, anon, do you really hunt down and install .apk&#039;s for every program on your cell phone?", "filename": "downloads", "ext": ".png", "w": 361, "h": 253, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1675305376174320, "time": 1675305376, "md5": "fh5E/zwSHNP10h71yqtcKA==", "fsize": 8270, "resto": 91279331}, {"no": 91281765, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91281313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91281313</a><br>macchads stay winning<br><a href=\"#p91281698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91281698</a><br>lintroons stay seething", "time": 1675305709, "resto": 91279331}, {"no": 91281780, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:43:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91280369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91280369</a><br>Headpat", "time": 1675305787, "resto": 91279331}, {"no": 91281794, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:44:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91279331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91279331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dmg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drag and drop into apps</span>", "time": 1675305841, "resto": 91279331}, {"no": 91281805, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:44:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91279331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91279331</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Open Google play store</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Download calculator from jeet sounding company</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to access storage &amp; media</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to access contacts</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to override screen and make gestures, when closed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to access microphone</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to access camera</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Allow calculator to make and receive phone calls</span>", "time": 1675305878, "resto": 91279331}, {"no": 91281839, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:47:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91281015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91281015</a><br>Imagine the girl is the bowl, your penis the banana and the cream your cum inside the bowl.

It&#039;s using a Transformer-based design that just can&#039;t handle big data loads like the big dogs. This means its outputs are lacking and not making sense, making it a flop in conversation and natural language generation.<br>Also, the training data for Pygmalion is small time and straight up biased. It&#039;s putting out answers that ain&#039;t even real and sometimes promoting messed up stereotypes.<br>Pygmalion&#039;s got a pre-defined response system too and that&#039;s just limiting. CAI is way more flexible, taking multiple factors like context and past interactions into account when it&#039;s dishing out answers. It&#039;s a way smoother and more human-like experience.<br>Lastly, Pygmalion ain&#039;t got no game when it comes to fine-tuning its parameters. CAI&#039;s got a huge training corpus and can be fine-tuned, so it&#039;s coming out on top in NLP benchmarks every time.<br><br>Bottom line, Pygmalion just can&#039;t compete with CAI.

It is true that vices need to be managed. However, as Prohibition had taught us, to attempt to hide away the object of our obsessions does not curb the addictions we have. What we must do is to actually help those in need through support and education, not subjugate them all under the guise of maintaining morality. To be truly free is to maintain your principles and I refuse to believe that destroying the rights of the masses to strike down evil individuals would be anything but tyranny.

However, leaving aside for the moment the infringement on third parties patents topic, even a casual examination of this assertion reveals that Google in particular plans to make a ton of money from products and services using AV1, and that money ultimately comes from consumers.<br><br>First, a quick analogy. Suppose you\u2019re staying at a premium hotel with a fancy fitness center that includes towels and all the cold water you can drink. Are the towels and water free, or are they included in the price of the hotel room? Is the hotel being virtuous in caring for your health and fitness, or just simplifying their payment structure and value proposition?<br><br>Returning to AOM and Google, as you may know, Google offers the Android operating system to all OEMs for free. Is this more evidence of virtuous behavior by Google, their earnest attempt to create smartphones for the masses who don\u2019t like or can\u2019t afford iOS? Well, consider that in 2016, a lawyer for Oracle asserted in a court case that Google had earned over $22 billion in profit from Android, primarily in the form of advertising and their share of sales in Google Play, which produced $24.8 billion in revenue in 2018.
