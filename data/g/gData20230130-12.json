Maybe even lower if the IO die isn&#039;t pushed as hard on account of the cache.<br>In summary, ignore the power differences. Even for all-core work the efficiency is broadly similar (but don&#039;t buy either if you do all-core work). The real question is whether the 3D cache would benefit the games you actually play. Read some benchmarks and judge whether it&#039;s worth the upfront cost.

You can also just use the terminal and smartctl -a to do this but it&#039;s not as nice.<br><br>Next, use this command, assuming sda is your bad drive and sdb is the good drive. Please don&#039;t be a dumbass and get these switched irl, make sure the values actually correspond to the right drives or you&#039;re gonna have a bad time: <br><br>Ddrescue -v -v -b 4096 -f /dev/sda /dev/sdb ~/Desktop/clonelog.log<br><br>This will write a &quot;map file&quot; to your desktop, if the clone stops or gets stuck, you can unplug and replug the drives and run the command again referencing that file and it&#039;ll keep going where you left off.

Interacting with the Rust compiler is the programming equivalent of having diabetes. You have to do your pancreas&#039;s job for it when you have diabetes. When you code in Rust you have to do the compiler&#039;s job for it w.r.t. imperatives and proving memory safety. See, it&#039;s kind of cringe, like democracy. In C you write a safe program and the compiler compiles it and it runs. In Rust you can&#039;t just write a safe program, you have to also convince the compiler that the program is safe. This increases programmer burden.

This renders the app with the gpu but the output still has to go through the integrated graphics resulting in lower FPS in games.

I also checked to make sure the nvidia kernel driver was binded with &quot;lspci -k&quot; in terminal, and it was. Is there a way for me to switch screens just for a specific application? or perhaps can I do the reverse, that being the intergrated graphics now outputs through the gpu?

What ever led you to believe what you saw projected from the pale blue light was any different?

Do you think online personalities are real? That posters are, or were ever being sincere and genuine? That the opinions you see regurgitated ad nauseam across the entire wired net of shit are anything but carefully curated, or purposefully dishonest? That even personal social media isn&#039;t a carefully curated projection of a personal ideal, not the depressing reality that most often lies beyond these facades?

So the problem with this is very weird, for a while it worked perfectly but now when you boot one the drives with windows 10, it warns you that some of the drives needs to be repaired, after repairing it fucks with all the windows permissions of that drive, so when you boot the other windows 10 you need to rewrite the windows permissions from the whole drive or you can&#039;t see any of the files. Also one of the drives which is brand new constantly get files corrupted, and this only happens when you boot the other windows 10 so it&#039;s not the drive malfunctioning. The windows permissions also change randomly, it may not happen as soon as you boot the other windows but sometime during the day the permissions just fucking change again or something gets corrupted. Also it&#039;s even more weird, this issue only affect 3 drives, the other drives remain unaffected so far. So basically I have to right click the drives and fix the permissions using the security tab, it set them to default and it last some days before windows rechecks the disks for errors and fuck the permissions again.

Pushing yourself to know what&#039;s going on under the hood is more important than living at a high managed layer of abstraction and then being stuck there because someone watered CS down for you in your early learning years. Talk about keeping things fun an motivating? What about the later years when you have that &quot;I only know python&quot; moment in your career and cant do anything else? I&#039;m starting to see this more. Will you feel good because your teacher gave you and A for learning Python? You have to put in the work at some point, now or later, theres no avoiding complexity.
