They were native to Mauritius, an island country located in the Indian Ocean, y&#039;know?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These fat and flightless birds lived there peacefully for a, uh, long time until the arrival of humans. Fun fact, before the humans arrived, the dodo birds had never encountered any large predators and were fearless of humans, making them easy targets for hunting and the reason for their extinction.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for their eco-system, well, they, uh, they were herbivores, meaning they ate only plant matter, anyways these plants and seeds they ate helped maintain the, hmm, vegetation there. And, in turn, their droppings helped fertilize the soil, kind of like a natural fertilizer, y&#039;know?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And, huh, oh there&#039;s a hypothetical thing I heard, these birds played a role in spreading the seeds of some plants by passing the seeds through their gut, which helped the plants to grow in new areas.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But, oh well, unfortunately, the humans didn&#039;t think about the consequences of their actions and hunted the poor birds to extinction. It&#039;s a sad thing, to see such a unique and important species disappear from the face of the earth like that, y&#039;know?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh, and wait, I, uh, I almost forgot, there were legends about the intelligence of the dodo birds too. Some say they were able to use tools to crack open the tough shells of seeds, making it easier for them to eat. But, of course, these are just legends, and there&#039;s no solid evidence.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, that&#039;s about it for the dodo birds. It&#039;s a cautionary tale about the effects of human intervention in nature, and how we should think twice before acting.

I started my 2nd attempt at an operating system on the first of January as my new year&#039;s resolution. 6 years ago I started wrting an OS and the community I went to chat with others doing the same urged me to write a comprehensive bootloader, to support both BIOS boot and UEFI, and to test it on real hardware. Turned out to be a horrid combination of simple but tedious. I gave up because it was so damned boring.<br>It&#039;s not even like it was for any gain - the bootloader runs once then fucks off. So the &quot;but this way it&#039;s only MY code running on the machnie&quot; doesn&#039;t hold water, because the bootloader fucks off. It&#039;s an even more invalid point because the system firmware also ran, so it&#039;s NOT only &#039;your own code&#039; running, and in fact the system firmware sticks around too.<br>So this time around I made the decision to get straight to work on what I was actually interested in - the scheduler, synchronization, and IPC. I&#039;ve built multilevel feedback queue with three priority classes - one for interrupts, one for realtime, and one for normal processes, each with 32 priority levels. Almost all hardware interrupts are handled by a special kind of lightweight kernel thread I&#039;ve called a threadlet, which simplifies coding dramatically - mutexes, semaphores, monitors, and message queues are available for synchronizing everywhere. I have mitigated priority inversion through a system of propagated priority inheritance, which is essential since interrupt threads use these high-level synchronization mechanisms instead of relying on spinlocks.<br>And I completely ignored people who said I need to write a bootloader. I found a simple bootloader called bootboot which puts you straight into x86_64 mode so you don&#039;t need to fuck with decades of legacy bullshit in modern PCs. Now I&#039;ve got something I feel proud of already.

But these techniques add a fuckton of cost and labour. Any imperfections will be amplified tenfold and parts have to be connected on edges or undersides as any cut will reveal the original underlying plastics.

But other than that? No, not really. The internet is not a mesh network, it&#039;s more akin so a large number of start topologies connected themselves in star topologies, on on the highest level do you have something other than star topology. But that still means a traditional Datacenter is going to outperform your web-3 solution by a lot. It&#039;s inherently a worse match for the actual topology of the internet, and because of that ISPs optimize their network to deliver you data from datacenters and not from other users potentially in the same region as you. This tendency only reenforces the already existing advantage classical datacenters have, making web-3 solution an absolute meme for 99% of use cases. So really the only appeal of web-3 is to make onion like websites available on the clearnet - with somewhat reduced privacy of course. Still, not having to download TOR can be a huge stepping stone for all kinds of illicit websites, essentially allowing you to get exposure more easily. You can for example include a TOR client written in JavaScript in the website and allow the customer to directly and securely see current offerings on your otherwise exclusively TOR using marketplace. If security of the customer isn&#039;t the highest priority you can even do the entire order and checkout system this way instead of explaining to the user that for their protection the TOR browser should be used.

Maid Space is a way to write a Number where it gets more dimensions. Radix means the base of the number. So if you think about binary, that is base 2. Calling it radix 2 means the same thing. Just a shorter word I like. Maid Space can be any radix and any number of dimensions. I am mostly playing with 2D ones for counting.<br><br>Why would you want this, probably you&#039;re thinking? Because it counts much bigger numbers that things line int or big int.<br><br>Normie Numbers break at 2^(64). I can make a number system with Maid Space where just the ones place counts bigger than that.<br><br>I am trying to figure out how to make the language nicer because two parts of Maid Space actually have radixes and it can become confusing.<br><br>If you look at this image <a href=\"#p91352267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91352267</a> you can see radix 3 counting in the cells used to make a 4 by 1 maid space. This can count from 0 to 3^(4). So those 4 cells in the bracket can be used as a single digit in a numbering system which is radix 3^(4). Using this idea, I can do very silly things like make a number where the ones place counts to 2^(100) (see attachment)<br><br>It is faster than BigInteger and can handle much larger numbers than BigInteger. Big integer is hereby deprecated and renamed SlowNumberlet.<br><br>I was trying to figure out how numbers get counted and vampire maid from touhou came and told me about Successor Function and wrote the letter S a lot of times. This caused me to try to make a successor function for maid space. Before this I didn&#039;t know what successor is and I was using SlowNumberlet for counting and I couldn&#039;t get numbers bigger than 2 billion digits in radix 10.<br><br>I used colored squares because that looks nicer than seeing a lot of Arabic digits.", "filename": "1670668169644973", "ext": ".png", "w": 897, "h": 503, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675678970330068, "time": 1675678970, "md5": "jc6OhWZPhtTSlZFxfJ7IhQ==", "fsize": 279888, "resto": 91351417}, {"no": 91369409, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:41:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91369218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91369218</a><br>Is this all to encode information in those Maid Cards, or is there a higher purpose to exploring these non-decimal counting methods?", "filename": "ninja_maid_layout_3_ss_by_zerion-dcagp6r", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1452, "h": 840, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1675680064088847, "time": 1675680064, "md5": "scicOoNdt10C/RwGQv+I/A==", "fsize": 431298, "resto": 91351417}, {"no": 91369576, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91367998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91367998</a><br>Maid Spaces which are two-dimensions and radix two are called Coolkyousinnjya Maid Spaces.

Unlike tortoise.<br><br>&quot;We describe a neural network-based system for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that<br>is able to generate speech audio in the voice of different speakers, including those<br>unseen during training. Our system consists of three independently trained components: (1) a speaker encoder network, trained on a speaker verification task using an<br>independent dataset of noisy speech without transcripts from thousands of speakers,<br>to generate a fixed-dimensional embedding vector from only seconds of reference<br>speech from a target speaker; (2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network based<br>on Tacotron 2 that generates a mel spectrogram from text, conditioned on the<br>speaker embedding; (3) an auto-regressive WaveNet-based vocoder network that<br>converts the mel spectrogram into time domain waveform samples. We demonstrate<br>that the proposed model is able to transfer the knowledge of speaker variability<br>learned by the discriminatively-trained speaker encoder to the multispeaker TTS<br>task, and is able to synthesize natural speech from speakers unseen during training.<br>We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse<br>speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance. Finally, we show<br>that randomly sampled speaker embeddings can be used to synthesize speech in<br>the voice of novel speakers dissimilar from those used in training, indicating that<br>the model has learned a high quality speaker representation.<br>&quot;", "time": 1675630431, "resto": 91357901}, {"no": 91358856, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)15:58:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There&#039;s literally 3 years of TTS papers and advancements from a wide variety of sources that are well beyond tortoise.<br><br>https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vit<wbr>s<br>These guys even provide 2 pre-trained models.<br><br>Why doesn&#039;t someone just email these researchers about running a TTS instead of trying to chisel a 5yo software?", "time": 1675630720, "resto": 91357901}, {"no": 91358899, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:00:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91358856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91358856</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why doesn&#039;t someone just email these researchers about running a TTS instead of trying to chisel a 5yo software?</span><br>unironically this can work. you can buy a genned edu account for real cheap to give yourself more legitimacy. when you send the email, frame it as &quot;we&#039;re doing research on combating misinformation blah blah blah&quot; so they&#039;ll be more likely to give you their shit", "time": 1675630843, "resto": 91357901}, {"no": 91358925, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:02:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91358856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91358856</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://jaywalnut310.github.io/vit<wbr>s-demo/index.html</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://jaywalnut310.github.io/vit<wbr>s-demo/wavs/ms_05_vits.wav</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://jaywalnut310.github.io/vit<wbr>s-demo/wavs/as_02_vits.wav</span><br>This shit sounds worse than tortoise though.", "time": 1675630947, "resto": 91357901}, {"no": 91358962, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91358644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91358644</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;multibillion dollar investments</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;startup</span><br>Kek, startups sole existance is to be bought for millions, not to make or spend millions.", "time": 1675631054, "resto": 91357901}, {"no": 91359005, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:07:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://vocaroo.com/1mcYA2LGqbJg<br><br>Keep blowing minds.

Our approach is to<br>decouple speaker modeling from speech synthesis by independently training a speaker-discriminative embedding network that captures the space of speaker characteristics and training a high quality model on a smaller dataset conditioned on the representation learned by the first network. Decoupling the networks enables them to be trained on independent data, which reduces the need to obtain high quality multispeaker training data. We train the speaker embedding network on a speaker verification task to determine if two different utterances were spoken by the same speaker.
