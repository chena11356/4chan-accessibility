If I was starting over, I&#039;d just get an ADI-2 and a pair of HD800S or comparable and would have suffered as long as necessary to avoid any compromise along the way. If I want &#039;color&#039; I&#039;ll just EQ/DSP it in. My ESP/95X respond well enough to EQ I&#039;ve got no real reason to &#039;upgrade&#039; when I&#039;m going to use speakers 90% of the time anyway.<br><br>I&#039;ll continue to use my headphones for some games and binaural stuff, but if I&#039;m being honest I hate having shit on my head anyway.

You fell for the biggest piece of audiophile bullshit in the world, that you&#039;re paying more money for better sound quality instead of the resulting placebo effect. You cannot tell me why the HD800S sounds better than any other headphones without it being nonquantifiable audiophile hocus pocus because all evidence points to frequency response being pretty much everything and there it doesn&#039;t standout. There is a near zero percent chance you could pick out the $2,000 ADI-2 from a cheap amp, or even a cheap motherboard with relatively low distortion, in blind testing. Nor could you pick out the $59,000 HE-1 from $150 headphones painstakingly EQed to sound the same to your ear, or vice versa because that works too.  <br><br>The most egregious flaws in FR are still pretty subtle. Research will tell us that mostly everyone will prefer one target over another target when listening to certain songs but it doesn&#039;t tell us if the difference is meaningful or if you would actually care either way.

This hobby sucks because no one wants to accept a harsh reality that would invalidate all their feelings and make them feel ashamed, they seek a religious experience that nothing can give them so instead they just pay more money and stick their head in the sand.

Also sometimes they tend to pick some kind of noise at high power like leaking electricity onto case and I had no fucking clue where the fuck was that coming from.<br>You can spend a bit more and get DT 1990 PRO which have the same soundstage but outperform in every way possible, including build quality and not being planar.<br>https://www.thomann.de/gb/beyerdyna<wbr>mic_dt_1990_pro_250_ohms.htm<br>I think this is the cheapest you can get them new from a decent seller unless you feel like gambling on amazon.", "filename": "1667088474431907", "ext": ".webm", "w": 720, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1671853788422923, "time": 1671853788, "md5": "LxqRMbh7kMzRJBXaj2dNdQ==", "fsize": 2966312, "resto": 90461843}, {"no": 90488157, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:15:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90487617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90487617</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HD600 with apple dongle</span><br>No one tell him.", "time": 1671855332, "resto": 90461843}, {"no": 90488338, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)23:28:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90488157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90488157</a><br>tell him what haha", "time": 1671856114, "resto": 90461843}, {"no": 90488890, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)00:03:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90487446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90487446</a><br>Good find, anon.

With regard to trannies, they pissed off Keffals, a famous tranny e-celeb, by posting screenshots of her underage catboy grooming Discord and her operation to distribute HRT to minors behind their parents&#039; backs. So Keffals started a campaign to pressure anti-DDoS providers and ISPs into dropping Kiwi Farms. It was easy for her to rally people to her cause because she has a lot of followers and because a lot of other trannies were already angry at Kiwi Farms for digging up their sordid backstories they don&#039;t want people to know. Things heated up and Keffals got doxed multiple times, including a dox from hotel bedsheets and a dox from wallpaper and doorknob. So she ran to the media with a press kit that lazy journalists could just copy-paste from, and that&#039;s how we got multiple articles about the Farms at the same time.<br>As for why people hated Keffals in the first place, it&#039;s because she&#039;s an Internet crybully and expert in being a victim. The usual modus operandi is<br>1. Enter a conversation/debate with some other e-celeb and pretend to have good faith.<br>2. Really piss him off in a way that&#039;s technically not against the rules, such as accusing a man of being a rapist.<br>3. When he gets angry enough to slip up and say something transphobic, take screenshots and pressure his platform into dropping him.<br>4. When he gets banned, celebrate another win for social justice against the evil bigots.

Even 0% is fine. Phones only discharge to 3.4V or so. Quite far from the actual damagingly low voltage. That would probably be below 2.8 or so. And it would need to be at such a low voltage for a while. And that probably barely happens anyway compared to a high voltage which it can stay at for a long time if you charge overnight.<br><br>My experience with the poco f3 has been good. I have consistently limited the charge to 80% or less sometimes. Generally picking a voltage of 4.10-4.20. I&#039;m sure I would have absolutely raped the battery in the past year had I not done this, because I use Android Auto.<br>From what I can tell it&#039;s very close to when I got it. SOH in the pic is kinda retarded because it hasn&#039;t really been allowed to charge to the factory max ever, so it can&#039;t really know. This is a rare full charge though, and it seems that the shadow counter shows slightly under the full charge capacity (4598) and is basically what went in during the last charging session. Specification is 4520mAh typical, so it&#039;s actually at 101% health possibly.<br><br>So yes it works, focus on limiting the top percentage way more than keeping it above 20%. And I think even a 90% limit, at whatever voltage that gets you will already at least double the life expectancy of the battery, so yeah if you have any option like that, just do it.

An interpreter can rewrite it&#039;s entire core and redefine every symbol and have equal or greater performance to how it started, whereas a compiled language gains 2-3 orders of magnitude speed in it&#039;s default state but slow exponentially as alterations are made to the core structure. Obviously an ideal compiler would be a continuous process that would automatically optimize and recompile the entire system in place while it&#039;s running, but no such compiler exists. At best, certain parts of the language can be optimized and other parts left unrestricted but slower to reach a general compromise.<br>The upshot of this is that a highly effective compiler requires intimate knowledge of the language to function. So if you translated CL code into another language, no matter how powerful that compiler is it wouldn&#039;t know how lisp works and would prioritize the wrong sections resulting in subpar performance unless you wrote all your code in a strict subset of the language that optimized well.<br>Which is what optimized CL code is, you&#039;ll notice it uses a very different convention to normal CL code which is a lot less flexible, but in exchange it approaches C level performance and can still call into slower conventional code at will if it needs to, effectively becoming superior to a CFFI interface to an optimized library because ti can ditch the IPC.", "time": 1671668032, "resto": 90370439}, {"no": 90444212, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:44:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "do any of you use a Lisp-based shell as your daily driver?", "filename": "closh_demo", "ext": ".gif", "w": 890, "h": 466, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1671669875605490, "time": 1671669875, "md5": "QXLa+HjxWGol90Wkk8e3+g==", "fsize": 4001575, "resto": 90370439}, {"no": 90445582, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:13:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Installing Guix on my QNAP because FUCK proprietary software", "time": 1671675211, "resto": 90370439}, {"no": 90446878, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90370439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90370439</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eMac thread</span><br><br>Whats ur guy&#039;s favorite Mac OS 9 game?

It&#039;s just copper that carries an analog signal. The main limit on resolution is the pixel clock of the RAMDAC (your videocards output), which is usually locked to 400mhz on last VGA/DVI-I GPUs. Though there&#039;s ways to unlock the limit and run even 700mhz down a VGA cable.<br>However the main limit is what your display will accept. CRT monitors don&#039;t understand pixel clock but they do have a specific range of horizontal and vertical refresh rates they&#039;ll able to run within. Almost all CRT monitors are able to run at least 160hz at low enough resolutions. <br>I myself own a NEC CRT that I run at 1280x960i 200hz for a certain game. I also own a GDM-F520 which does some really nice resolutions, eg 1080p120hz, 1200p107hz, 2160p60hz.<br>There are a few &quot;unlocked&quot; CRT monitors which are able to sync to even 420hz, eg the Iiyama VMP454 https://old.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/<wbr>comments/jhsysv/240p420hz_not_bad_f<wbr>or_a_17_year_old_monitor/<br><br>PSA, you can use any modern graphics card to connect a CRT, just buy the Delock 62967", "time": 1671806584, "resto": 90473527}, {"no": 90475654, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)09:44:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90473527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90473527</a><br>You&#039;re free to use DP literally anytime.", "time": 1671806691, "resto": 90473527}, {"no": 90475788, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)09:53:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Which was the most modern card with any kind of analog output?<br>I mean consumer ones, the are probably some for the industry.", "time": 1671807234, "resto": 90473527}, {"no": 90475806, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)09:55:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "jews", "time": 1671807300, "resto": 90473527}, {"no": 90475834, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)09:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90475633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90475633</a><br>Thank you anon.

Started with Cherry Silent Reds (45g) then to Kailh Speed Silvers (50g) then to Kailh Box Silent Pinks (35g) and just recently got some TTC Gold Pinks (38g). Lighter switches are the best because they enable fast, accurate typing, though they do take some time to get used to. Lots of double or accidental entry will happen until you normalize the force needed to actuate, but in the end it will only make you a better typist.<br>I really like the sound of the Gold Pinks, but being a bit heavier than the Silent Pinks it did take a while to acclimate. Out of all the switches, though, I think I liked the Speed Silvers the best. I&#039;m almost willing to go back to them, but I don&#039;t want to purchase them right now just to put the rest of my switches to pasture forever. They&#039;re a bit heavier but way smoother, just feel good to type on. If I did I would mod them with a lower actuation spring anyway, so not even sure it&#039;s worth the effort.<br>35g is about as low as you can go with MX profile, and Silent Pinks and Gold Pinks are both great options. But from 68g I&#039;d suggest trying out Speed Silvers first (they are relatively cheap - 35 for $15) and then go lower depending on what you like. From my experience, once you go low you never want to go back; it&#039;s just pointless to use additional force and overall is better for your wrists as long as you learn to type gingerly and don&#039;t smash the keys into oblivion.", "time": 1671728713, "resto": 90427734}, {"no": 90457257, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:12:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90456982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90456982</a><br>They are decorative and not everyone can type without legends, retarded faggot.", "time": 1671729132, "resto": 90427734}, {"no": 90457312, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:15:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90427952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90427952</a><br>If you&#039;re not married to 100 and think 75 would give you everything you need, the Reddragon PRO series now comes with full hot-swap capability:<br>https://redragonshop.com/products/6<wbr>5-percent-keyboard<br>Extremely cheap and will be mostly silent with Reds, could always use a little extra cash to get some silent switches if you want to go quieter or lighter.

All the faders are pretty much the same length/size/color and they&#039;re fucking everywhere.

The biggest one was probably the shibazi F208. I love cooking and while I did own a great knife (a shun classic chefs knife) it was a little too long for my tastes and my other knives were all rather cheap ones made from questionable steel. The F208 (for around 30\u20ac at the time) is perfect for me and a real joy to use. Since it&#039;s something I use everyday (and thus something that makes me happy every day) it&#039;s probably the item with the largest enjoyment payoff. <br>The second one could be my ramen blanket. It was cheap-ish holds up super well, is soft and is more versatile than I thought (working as a blanket and pillow). If I don&#039;t use it as a blanket I use it as a cover over my chair to sit on. I also use it as a travel pillow/blanket combo sometimes when I sleep somewhere else or for long trips.<br>Third is a generic hip bag that I use for fishing equipment. It&#039;s nothing special, but the fact that I no longer have to carry a giant and unwieldy bag and instead feel like I barely have anything with me is a big improvement in quality of life. <br>Latest one is my camping stuff, as someone who enjoys camping but used to use random shot from around the flat I now managed to replace most of those things with items that weigh half, have maybe a fourth the volume all while feeling more comfortable and high quality. Mostly the sleeping bag, cutlery and tent are big improvements. Only tested those out once so far to be fair (because it&#039;s fucking cold) but that&#039;s quite the enjoyment for now. <br>If you are looking for something cheaper, it&#039;s either my wallet (the one in last thread in the 3 for 6 deal) for 2$ or a metal comb that I got a year back or so. The metal makes it feel far more premium, and I do get some enjoyment from it whenever I use it.", "time": 1671799057, "resto": 90433554}, {"no": 90473889, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)07:41:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90473575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90473575</a><br>Aren&#039;t there studies showing that while electric toothbrushes are better in ideal conditions they are often worse in daily use by the average consumer?
