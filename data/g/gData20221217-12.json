You need to do three things;<br>1. Buy what you need<br>2. Buy what you like<br>3. Buy what you want<br>Do this in order. Don&#039;t buy things you &#039;want&#039; (unnecessary peripherals or decorations, etc) until you&#039;ve done the first two steps.<br>So you would start with this: Buy a desk that you like. Buy a computer that you like. Buy a keyboard and mouse that you like. Buy a mousepad that you like. Buy some headphones or speakers that you like. Buy a chair that you like. Buy a lamp that you like. Start with the essentials first, make sure you like everything, don&#039;t think too much about how it will match with other things you&#039;ve bought. Just buy what you need and like first.<br>You&#039;ll end up with something like this: <a href=\"#p90342607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90342607</a> which is natural, you can see Bam or whoever purchased this stuff didn&#039;t think about it too much, just bought what was needed and what they liked.<br>If you think too much, you&#039;ll end up with this: <a href=\"#p90343617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90343617</a> which is just shit.<br>Then once you&#039;ve got the essentials done, buy some stuff you&#039;d like to decorate the area with. Again, look at Bam&#039;s pic for a good reference. Put up some stuff you like, if you want. you don&#039;t have to. But comfy is all about what YOU like, not what someone else thinks looks good. But you can&#039;t try too hard, otherwise your setup will look like every other reddit users, which are all shit.

I&#039;m trying to find Spanish language audio movies and TV shows, as in stuff that was originally in Spanish as opposed to dubs, with Spanish subtitles. It doesn&#039;t matter if they are SHD subs or just regular. I&#039;m an English speaker who is far enough along in learning Spanish that I can watch stuff with Spanish audio and Spanish subs to read along; not advanced enough to just listen to the audio alone and probably won&#039;t be for years.<br><br>A lot of the movies on PTP or shows on BTN that are from Spanish speaking countries tend to not have the Spanish subs. I&#039;m not sure if they were ripped or never available in the first place. A lot of the discs I rent from Netflix to rip have the Spanish subs present, but many don&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping that Spanish trackers might have people ripping them from releases in Spanish speaking countries, which would be more likely to have Spanish subs. Finding them on external subtitle sites is very hit or miss, as is the quality of the translations.<br><br>I know as hard as HD Spain is to get into I&#039;d have to be mayor of Madrid for at least a few years before I got an invite, but does anyone have any other leads? I recently joined Lat-Team and it&#039;s lacking in the content area. I&#039;m down to contribute to build it up, but of the few times it has what I&#039;m looking for, Spanish subs aren&#039;t present.

You start to generate pneumatic pressures on the eardrum that are much more powerful than purely acoustic pressures. I realized that because, in the \u201890s, I started to find that after, say, three hours of wearing my own earbuds while mixing the sound for a concert my ears were ringing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: Your understanding of the situation became much deeper.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SA: Yes. With a freefield speaker, the diaphragm moves backwards and forwards. That means that at its extremes, when it changes direction it is stationary. So it is generating the maximum pressure when it is in the middle of one of its excursions because when it is moving the fastest, it is velocity-based.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But when you seal it inside a closed environment, then the pressure is greatest at its point of maximum extension; it is displacement-based. So, if you go from an unsealed to a sealed ear, you raise the bass by 60 decibels (dB) but you also drop the mid-range by 10-20dB. That is something no one had noticed before.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interviewer: Other research helped confirm your findings.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SA: There was a study of in-ear hearing aids carried out by an audiologist in Australia. It showed that when you put one in you get what is called an \u201cinsertion gain\u201d \u2013 the sound volume rises \u2013 but the loudness perception is reduced in the mid-range. That is because you are holding the eardrum still in the mid-range because it cannot vibrate without compressing that trapped air in the ear canal and it has not got enough energy to do that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SA: You are making the ear less sensitive in the mid-range while overwhelming it in the bass. In addition, the extremes of the bass excursion tighten the eardrum to make it even less sensitive in the mid-range and the highs.</span>", "time": 1671207504, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90335673, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335501</a><br>Crin needs to come out with some serious subass set because quite frankly all of his IEMs are low T no bass", "time": 1671207561, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90335695, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:20:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335673</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quite frankly all of his IEMs are low T no bass</span><br>I swear he once described himself as a basshead, which I laughed it, but now I can&#039;t find the quote.", "time": 1671207643, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90335725, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:22:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335673</a><br><a href=\"#p90335695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335695</a>", "filename": "FHE", "ext": ".png", "w": 1304, "h": 653, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1671207739534305, "time": 1671207739, "md5": "Ny4+Juty1vDjo6pckUr6UQ==", "fsize": 72523, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90335760, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:24:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335725</a><br>If it&#039;s not at least 15 dB over flat tuning it&#039;s nobass", "time": 1671207878, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90336047, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335660</a><br>tldr?", "time": 1671208797, "resto": 90334793}, {"no": 90336450, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)12:01:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90335660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90335660</a><br>Nice.

Or even a non-TWS wireless setup for that matter.<br>I think TWS and wired IEMs are completely different things and there is not much point in making direct comparisons.<br>TWS win by a huge margin in terms of mobility and convenience. Small footprint, quick and easy to use, take them out of the case, put them into your ears, that&#039;s it. No need to deal with cables, DACs, DAPs, no need to carry all that stuff all the time and so on.<br>TWS provide some extra utility in terms of phone calls (though many quality-oriented TWS tend to be pretty bad at this) and active features. ANC is mostly a meme, talk through mode is great if for example you work in an office and your TWS buds have good isolation and you have to be able to talk to other people every now and then. In similar conditions if your IEMs have poor isolation you will have to deal with, well, poor isolation, and if your IEMs have good isolation you&#039;re going to have to take them out of your ears every time you have to talk to someone which may or may not be a hassle depending on how often that happens to you.<br>If these point are important to you then you can deal with TWS&#039; subpar sound.

Artists are unique type of workers where they put all their self worth into art for the sake of it. They are not even autistic workers like those you find in other professions, since they would not react this hostile to tech replacing them. They would be sad they don&#039;t do the thing anymore, but they would no try to defend their title this much. Artists even when completely neurotypical have this special kind of artistic autism where everything is bound to their work. To attack their work is to attack them, or even more. You can criticize it, and they will congratulate you because said attack made them better at their job, but otherwise they get extremely defensive.

But look up some of the security concerns with it, I agree that it would be nice to have Arch but with a cleaner installer and more apps installed by default, Manjaro is focused on providing that but they cut corners from a security and reliability standpoint.  For example their package release system is actually worse than Arch&#039;s and more liable to break shit.  They delay packages for 2 weeks for no reason--they&#039;re not vetting them or anything, just delaying them.  Which means you&#039;re more likely to have dependencies of shit have the wrong version and cause a complete clusterfuck, especially with the keyring and security stuff that verifies packages.  I have had to reinstall unbootable Manjaro installs in the past several times because of this.<br><br>So for now I just use pure Arch, though I would be open to something else with an automated installation process.
