Alright, I&#039;ll explain to you how the boot process works.<br><br>After the Power-On-Self-Test (POST) the CPU starts executing whatever the BIOS feeds it. At this point the CPU is in so-called Real Mode, which is some arcane 80s mumbo jumbo that only has one 1 megabyte of address space to work with, which is not equivalent to 1 megabyte of RAM - there&#039;s all sorts of other shit mapped into that megabyte, like video RAM, the BIOS code itself, some registers, the works, and traditionally only the lower 640 KB were actually mapped to RAM (&quot;640 KB ought to be enough for everybody&quot; said literally no one ever).<br><br>Real Mode has a couple of advantages that no one cares about these days, like that I/O (hard disks, solid disks, flash memory, etc.) is being taken care of by the BIOS, via BIOS interrupts; there is no need to load in any I/O drivers. Since<br>1 megabyte obviously isn&#039;t enough for anything these days any reasonable kernel out there tries to switch to Protected (32-bit) or Long (64-bit) as quickly as possible; however, once the switch happened, the BIOS is officially out of the equation (unless you switch back to virtual real mode, which is real slow and real bothersome, but used to be the fallback on older DOS-based Windows&#039; like 95 or 98 in case the IDE driver couldn&#039;t be loaded), so the system already needs to have its I/O drivers loaded into memory in case it needs to load in more stuff from some drives.<br><br>What happens with Windows 7 is that the CPU is in Real Mode, during which it loads in the kernel and its drivers and all that fun stuff, and then switches modes to Protected/Long Mode.

It was born, as you touch on, to deal with large amounts of conventional memory being available. In The Beginning(TM), DOS (being the first &quot;program&quot;) loaded in the first 64KB of conventional memory, so no application could ever allocate memory in the first 64KB. A lot of language runtime libraries therefore walled off the first 64KB from their malloc() implementations for things like NULL pointer detection (something Windows still does - try to VirtualAllocEx() with a base below 64KB, and it&#039;ll tell you to fuck off).<br><br>Then along came 286s, with their flashy 24 bit address bus and &quot;Extended Memory&quot; shit, and due to a quirk of how x86 does real-mode addressing, suddenly there was about 64KB of RAM available on the 1MB line (whole cute story behind that, thus birthing the A20 gate), which was dubbed the &quot;high memory area&quot;. To maximise conventional RAM, DOS offered the option to load itself high (hence DOS=HIGH in many CONFIG.SYSs of the time). Problem was, now that the first 64KB of RAM was free, programs can (and often did) get memory addresses below the 64KB line, fucking them right up.<br><br>And this is what LOADFIX did: simply forced the program to load at, or above, the 64KB line.<br><br>Thus endeth the history lesson.

Also some dual record players which still blow most new stuff out of the water. Amplification is not that complicated and most modern achievements are in regards to power efficiency. You cannot really fuck up amp design nowadays unless you are some esoteric audiofool company that wants to add their brand sound or what ever. dsp room corrections is really nice for multi channel, integrating subs and getting rid of modes.<br>Problem with vintage speakers is sometimes repairing disintegrating  rubber and sourcing parts. There have been some improvements in driver, cabinet and crossover design thanks to simulations but yeah thats it. I mean if you are really stupid like me you can get obsessed about those things. But honestly since I live in a prison state I do not have that much space for all that stuff so I use active speakers and a minidsp as a preamp. Would love to have a bigger space where I can put a &quot;vintage&quot; listening setup but yeah guess I will own nothing and be happy.

I wonder if you could implement it using MOP to gain some benefits like type checks and other nice things. <br>Constraints appear to be roughly equivalent to a lambda which takes the scheme it is in as an implicit argument; though the fact that they can be circular appears odd - I&#039;m not sure how exactly to model that. In general, constraints remind me of a thing I saw in GOOPS years ago, which is slots with :virtual allocation - they were essentially functions that took the object they were in as an argument and returned their value. It was quite an elegant system - it seems somewhat simpler than the constraint system, but not as powerful.<br><br>Looking at the code for kr, there seems to be some room for improvement. E.g. the is-* functions in kr-macros.lisp look up a dynamic variable (*is-*-bit*) which seems both weird (are the bits expected to change over time?) and inefficient. In general, it seems like the code uses a LOT of dynamic variables, which may be problematic with multithreading - which is probably necessary for a GUI toolkit.

Let&#039;s take your example. Your customer is most likely already authenticated so he already has his information in the client and the parts that should not be shown (say his Id) are part of the claims of his httpOnly JWT (which he sends back to your api as part of the headers of the request). The existence of a bounded context also involves that some referencial data belonging to a given context and needed elsewhere should be replicated where it will be often needed. So the application server will only make a call to a single database server (either the orders or the shipping server depending on how you designed your app).

They agreed to break the law at the time by signing a secret agreement to divide the land, a local People&#039;s Commune, into family plots. Each plot was to be worked by an individual family who would turn over some of what they grew to the government and the collective whilst at the same time agreeing that they could keep the surplus for themselves. The villagers also agreed that should one of them be caught and sentenced to death that the other villagers would raise their children until they were eighteen years old.[5][6] At the time, the villagers were worried that another famine might strike the village after a particularly bad harvest and more people might die of hunger.[6]</span><br><br>    &gt;After this secret capitalist reform, Xiaogang village produced a harvest that was larger than the previous five years combined.[5] Per capita income in the village increase from 22 yuan to 400 yuan with grain output increasing to 90,000 kg in 1979.[6] This attracted significant attention from surrounding villages and before long the government in Beijing had found out. The villagers were fortunate in that at the time China had just changed leadership after Mao Zedong had died. The new leadership under Deng Xiaoping was looking for ways to reform China&#039;s economy and the discovery of Xiaogang&#039;s innovation was held up as a model to other villages across the country. This led to the abandonment of collectivised farming across China and a large increase in agricultural production.

The first stage, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the de-collectivization of agriculture, the opening up of the country to foreign investment, and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses. However, a large percentage of industries remained state-owned. The second stage of reform, in the late 1980s and 1990s, involved the privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry. The 1985 lifting of price controls[7] was a major reform, and protectionist policies and regulations soon followed, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Probably because of some of the reasons other anons have been accusing you of being motivated by instead of whatever your reasons are, but I think know what you&#039;re looking for. Best way to experience this is to walk around in a crowded public place. Look for small groups of people: usually energetic groups of young adults are what you&#039;re looking for, but whatever the case good groups will be absorbed in their own conversation and activities, so they won&#039;t notice or care that you&#039;re following them. You can spend hours listening to their natural conversations this way, it&#039;s very nice. Even better is if you live somewhere sunny, since sunglasses allow you to watch without having to use your peripheral vision all the time. If you have clip on sunglasses that are slightly too large and the sun is in the right position you can even watch them with your back facing towards them, and you can hold up your phone in front of you on maps or something. This way, they won&#039;t notice even if they pass very close to you.
