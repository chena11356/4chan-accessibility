The rest of the Linux desktop ecosystem will likely follow within a couple of years. The main reason people think Wayland doesnt work is because they use b0rked shit like KrashDE. Only retards and tech-illiterates think X is good, let alone better than Wayland.<br><br>The reason it has taken so long for Wayland to become the default is because most DEs dont have a lot of devs, and most users dont know or care about Wayland.

Are those two libraries too different for this approach to be reasonable?", "time": 1672457462, "resto": 90585463}, {"no": 90614776, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:08:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90594455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90594455</a><br>Watch the old SICP lectures", "time": 1672459691, "resto": 90585463}, {"no": 90614791, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:09:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90606872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90606872</a><br>Least documented?<br>There are tons of books about Scheme.<br>Tons of academic papers as well.<br><br>I would say it&#039;s actually the most documented language.", "time": 1672459753, "resto": 90585463}, {"no": 90614812, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:10:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90614314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90614314</a><br>It&#039;s not that much work to do your own binding.<br>You only need to implement the calls you actually use (you&#039;re not going to use 100% of SDL) and it&#039;s a good way to learn (or improve your knowledge of) the SDL API.", "time": 1672459846, "resto": 90585463}, {"no": 90615925, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)00:50:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90609898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90609898</a><br>Modus light, it&#039;s the only light theme I&#039;ve found where the colors are legible.

There are a lot of idiots out there who think adhering to &quot;true Unix&quot; tradition means a bunch of shitty ncurses interfaces, but suckless is one of the few groups that really understands the appeal of Unix tools, because they&#039;re not shitty ncurses interfaces, and they&#039;re not even shitty, interactive CLI interfaces; Unix tools are one-dimensional. They&#039;re singular in there application, with no superlatives or quality-of-life features, and a pleasant side-affect of that is that they&#039;re light and pipe-able. Emacs works best as a frontend for software like that. Surf is somewhat neutered, so it depends on dmenu to sort of carry things from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;, something that what otherwise be poorly-implemented by the browser itself, like issuing search search queries and searching for arbitrary text, but the funny thing is, Emacs does precisely that, except better. I can interact with Surf via Emacs in precisely the same way dmenu is used to interact with Surf, and that simply wouldn&#039;t be possible if it weren&#039;t for suckless&#039; paradoxically humble elitism. Emacs loves simple applications, because it&#039;s easy to take something intentionally shallow and effectively create your own toolkit with Elisp.

It is a term used to describe a computer system that has the capability to think, reason, and learn in the same way as a human would. AGI is a far cry from the current state of AI, which is typically limited to narrow, specific tasks.<br><br>The future of AI is uncertain, and it is hard to predict when AGI will be achieved. However, many experts believe that the technology is rapidly evolving and that we may see AGI in 2023. This is due to the advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies. For example, deep learning has enabled us to create powerful neural networks that can accurately process large amounts of data and make predictive decisions. This has enabled machines to learn complex tasks, and even surpass human performance in certain areas.<br><br>In addition to advancements in technology, there are also significant economic incentives to develop and deploy AGI. Many tech companies are already investing heavily in AI research and development, and these investments are likely to continue as the technology matures. This increased investment could lead to breakthroughs in AGI and other forms of AI, and it may be possible to see AGI in 2023.<br><br>Finally, it is important to note that the development of AGI is not just about technology. We must also consider the ethical implications of such a powerful technology and how it might be used. There are many potential applications for AGI, including healthcare, transportation, security, and even entertainment. However, it is important to consider the potential negative implications of AGI, such as the potential for misuse or its impact on society.<br><br>Overall, it is difficult to predict when AGI will be achieved. However, the advances in technology and the increased investment in AI research suggest that AGI may be achieved by 2023.

The others are right in that it lacks features. If all you want is a minimalist browser ui with vim binds, Firefox/Waterfox with Tridactyl and a custom userChrome. It is not difficult to tailor the userChrome script to your needs but knowing CSS helps immensely. There&#039;s a pretty good subreddit in case you get lost. FirefoxCSS or something close. It is possible to run a debugger on your Firefox instance so that you can inspect the elements of your browser. For example, you can mouseover an element to see what its name is so that you can modify how it looks in the userChrome. There&#039;s not many limits on what you can do, either. I have my address bar hidden except on mouseover. You can even theme the context menu, bookmark manager, history manager, etc. As Firefox gets updated, though, you will find more and more restrictions on what you can do. It has been happening for many years. You used to be able to set the minimum height of the tab bar to 20 pixels or so but now it forces 24 pixel height.

Commercial passenger aircraft were only just around the late 30\u2019s hitting that point where it was viable. And by 1937 when the Hindenburg disaster occurred, aircraft had reached that point where transatlantic flight at much higher speed with many more people and far less crew was normal. By that time having 70+ passengers and 5-10 total crew on a flight from USA to Western Europe was doable without great expense. Albeit it was a different sort of market it appealed to, as you were crammed into a smaller space, something like a pan-am 314 clipper could come in a variety of configurations anywhere from 15-20 passengers in a very well equipped space with proper beds and a kitchen, to 70+ passengers in a seating only arrangement. <br>Airships were described as flying hotels, because they were more focused on the experience of the flight versus the goal of getting from point A to point B. There were intentions to use airships for simply mass travel where they could by all means hold far more passengers and do it at a lower cost, but they\u2019d also be much slower. <br>So many hours crammed into a small plane over an ocean was already bad enough. Quadruple the hours and quadruple the people and I\u2019m positive each airship passenger flight would have an average projected killcount the second someone blew out the shitter 2 hours into the journey.<br><br>But the big one was the crew required, that point I brought up about complexity in maintaining the operation. Airships had crews of 30-70 people on them, depending on the passenger count and services offered, but even just functional operation needed upwards of two dozen men.<br>Passenger Airplanes could get away with 4-5 crew, maybe a few stewards. And could either go more or less depending on needs.

Smith, the leader of a group of investors erecting the Empire State Building, announced that they would be increasing the building\u2019s height by two hundred feet, making it slightly taller than its rival, the Chrysler Building.

And of course, the build quality and aesthetic feels cheap and ugly in chinkboards. Q1 and GMMK Pro are okay boards; they tick a lot of the enthusiast check boxes such as 5-pin hotswap sockets, QMK/VIA compatibility, gasket mount (not necessary), and of course a clean and inoffensive aesthetic.

I don&#039;t have to put the phone on speaker to hear it in the car.<br>Fingerprint reader sucks.

I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

Because if the samples are essentially the same as everyone else, but different on such a microscopic level that you are effectively still getting the same product and it takes an AI scan to find the watermark, then it&#039;s only different from everyone else by a fraction of a percent. And very minimal mixing will change the sample by orders of magnitude more than that. And plus, what are they really gonna do?

I think AI art is amazing, and super cool. I&#039;m not scared of it, because I don&#039;t invest my whole personality around the art I make. I like to draw naked women, and nature; in real life. AI can&#039;t do that for me, so it&#039;s a niche that hasn&#039;t affected me; yet.<br><br>But there are certain things that I notice as a person who can create illusrations or representitive scenes that I know that the AI doesn&#039;t know how to do and I&#039;m going to list that out for you guys in a series of posts. Most of you guys are smart, I&#039;m sure you guys are going to read this without any bias.<br><br>1. AI art models don&#039;t understand perspective.<br><br>What I notice a lot about AI art is that, it doesn&#039;t understand the concept of horizons and field of view. This is a basic concept when you are drawing a scene in nature, or even the human figure. There is only one point of view, and that is the artists. I have seen several scenes where the AI will create ridged objects that woudl recene with distance from your point of view to the horizon and it would give every single object it&#039;s own terminating field of view. I<br><br>It fails at this all the time, which is why most AI art has an uncanny dreamlike feeling. This is also why the best results are peices that invole the figure or close up textures, but not city scapes or rooms with windows. It may not understand that the horizon line encompases the whole scene.<br><br>RIght now, if I were to use AI art to make a scene like attached I would have to do some fixing of the persective. That would mean a paint over pretty much; and just like coders; I might as well have done that work from the beggining.<br><br>1/3", "filename": "how-to-make-use-of-perspective-drawing-in-anime-and-manga", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672466379588255, "time": 1672466379, "md5": "cMaxAWI2YraEPsMkdrGydw==", "fsize": 253237, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "honest-artfag-thread-about-ai-art", "replies": 22, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 90616056, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:02:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "fuck.<br>off.", "time": 1672466570, "resto": 90616022}, {"no": 90616081, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90616022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90616022</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AI art models don&#039;t understand perspective.</span><br>sort of. this is a very temporary situation as you can see with SD2.0&#039;s depth mapping and more advanced 3D demos like point-e.", "time": 1672466646, "resto": 90616022}, {"no": 90616092, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:05:39", "name": "Honest artfag", "com": "<a href=\"#p90616022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90616022</a><br><br>2.
