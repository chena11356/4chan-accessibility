Guerrilla marketers use many viral marketing tactics using boards such as /g/ as a platform for advertising. They take advantage of the inherent anonymity and amnesia these boards provide by posting multiple repeat-threads while samefagging their threads to gain momentum. These paid posters sometimes come in the form of a shill, or a company employee pretending to be an enthusiastic customer in order to entice you to buy their product. Also, they can be &quot;Trojan Horse Trolls&quot; by posing as a supporter of their competitor while making incoherent diatribes that discredit themselves and their alleged supported product. Then, a &#039;voice of reason&#039; will point out the error of their ways and boost their product&#039;s image. They are talented and well versed in Alinsky tactics in order to generate endless discussions about their products, essentially giving their products free air time with your eyes while also getting you actively involved in a discussion about them. That alone is priceless advertisement for boards which are action packed full of gadget whores such as ourselves. Now here&#039;s where I come into play. I am creating this post not because I have my tinfoil hat on too tight, but because this exact thread or a thread like it has been posted continuously for the past couple of days and includes tell tail signs that it was created by a paid internet troll. I want to warn anon, especially the newfags, about these threads.

After all back then, most rugged phones only had shitty budget peasant phone performance since the manufacturers skimped on performance for the water and dust proofing and huge batteries. But the &quot;flagship&quot; rugged phones like the Ulefone Power Armor 18T, Doogee V30 and Oukitel&#039;s WP21 have Dimensity 900 5G SoCs, 120hz displays, 108MP cameras good quality audio speakers and in the case of the Doogee V30; has E-Sim capabilities. Honestly, I am tempted and wishing to be able to buy maybe the Power Armor 18T or the Doogee V30 for the rugged and 5G since my Samsung A71 from 2020 is already showing its age and I think its AMOLED screen is starting to show off wear and tear age and little bits of AMOLED burn.<br><br>Though I guess some of you would say to pick a newer Samsung or more recognized Android for the security and OS updated down the line. To which, yeah I have thought of about too.

A dev is a commodity and if you&#039;re still coding after 30 your career is fucked.<br>I&#039;m a wealthy dev, can code and read code but the only work that makes sense for me is to hire and manage devs. In fact this makes me super valuable because unlike hr retards I can see how competent someone actually is.<br><br>This isn&#039;t unique to coding. This is the fact of every industry. At some point you are supposed to amass enough wealth (some combination of financial and social capital) and the most valuable use of your time is to manage other people utilizing your past knowledge rather than doing stuff yourself. What separates those who make from those who don&#039;t is learning a new thing - the ability to delegate.<br>It was much less visible in the past because there was a massive shortage of devs. This massive shortage meant the relative value of management was much lower. That period is over. Being a dev doesn&#039;t require higher iq than being an engineer in many fields.<br><br>This is the transition period. In 10+ years western software devs will earn less than other engineers. Why? Because unlike eg. a process engineer working at a chemical company, it&#039;s much easier to outsource.<br>Instead of falling by the wayside you have to adapt - like starting a consulting company and directly hire foreign cheaper devs.<br><br>Note: the trick is to hire them directly. Many people go the retarded route and subcontract to some local company because they don&#039;t want to talk to Sasha or Pranav. This is a mental mistake in which all foreign devs are dehumanized as one big commodity pool you can tap into. No. What devs are going to work as dedicated offshoring companies? The worst ones, and if any good one ends up there as an accident, they leave immediately.

Occasionally (every 2-3 months) I attach an external and I use FreeFileSync to update the backup disk. I prefer to run it on the server itself, using remote desktop, rather than running FreeFileSync from a different computer (my laptop), because when I do it locally, anything deleted goes into the proper Recycle Bin on the external drive, but if I do it over the network, files are just completely deleted, they don&#039;t go into the Recycle Bin. So then I would have to configure a custom recycle bin within FreeFileSync, and either put that on yet a third drive, or change the folder structure on the bacup drive to accomodate that. Extra layer of complication, extra annoyance.<br><br>So anyway, while the Windows Server array has been stable for me for 7 months, everywhere I turn people tell me I&#039;m still playing Russian Roulette with the data, so I&#039;m thinking about TrueNAS Core and ZFS or UNRAID with the data integrity plugin.<br><br>But yeah, I would love to plug in a cold single disk from time to time via USB, remote in and manually run a sync from the array to the bacup disk, FreeFileSync-style.

That&#039;s the nicest way I can say you&#039;re almost completely wrong. You&#039;re criticizing speakers for being imperfect at replicating sound in a space, when headphones are even worse than speakers in this respect in the way people commonly get to use them. Especially people like OP asking questions that aren&#039;t audio enthusiasts.<br><br>Headphones can be the perfect device for simulating spatial sound, but the problem is you need custom HRTFs to do this. Getting HRTFs setup for yourself is one thing but your source must also be designed for HRTF to fully benefit, either recorded for HRTF or a game engine or whatever. But yes if you have HRTF, at worst you can simulate any number and location of speakers you like. I don&#039;t know the state of this is, last time I tried to acquire my own HRTF, it still wasn&#039;t easy. Most people are going to be using no HRTF, or some generic HRTF that spatializes sound only a little bit, and it works better or worse depending on how close your head and ear shape is to the reference. <br><br>Without HRTF, i.e. most of the time we talk about audio. Stereo speakers sound better than headphones for spatial qualities, both in the pleasing qualities of space and localization of sources. 4 speakers is also enough to envelop you in sound if you know where to place them.

No, I tell them. Then they say there&#039;s literally nothing I can do. The IT person suggests that I get people I know to report the account for suspicious activity. I tell them that there&#039;s no need, I am telling them about it right now with receipts.

That&#039;s a bad idea for a few reasons, but most importantly I don&#039;t trust external drives with anything important.<br><br>First things first, a NAS is basically just a computer that has a purpose of just saving files from other computers in your house. All of your drives are connected to it, and you can access it from other computers in your house. You can also run other software on it (like Plex), since it&#039;s just a computer. <br><br>TrueNAS is another operating system vs Windows. It&#039;s been created to just be a really solid NAS operating system. You can also use UnRAID (another NAS operating system), but it costs money. I would do some research on which one you&#039;d rather use.<br><br>Now, you can just buy a whole NAS as a package. Things like a Synology NAS or something. There are a lot of them, but you will be locked into their ecosystem, for better or worse. This may be the route you want to go down, unless you like tinkering with computers.<br><br>Since TrueNAS/Unraid are just operating systems, you need a computer to install them on. I would just build a new PC or if you have one with enough SATA ports (the connector hard drives use inside a case), you can use that. This PC build would be one that has a case and enough plugs to connect it all up. <a href=\"#p91067443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91067443</a> I would also install the operating system on another drive instead of one with all of your data. That&#039;s missing from the parts list.<br><br><br>What I said about ECC Ram, it&#039;s a special type of computer memory, and it&#039;s designed for servers or other things where the data being correct is important. It contains logic to find and correct errors in memory, and it&#039;s typically recommended to use it for a NAS. It&#039;s more expensive, and you&#039;d need to use a server processor to use it, but it might be worthwhile. <br><br>Lastly, hard drives die eventually, so you can try and prevent being screwed over by using something called RAID Z2.", "time": 1674461110, "resto": 91067012}, {"no": 91067672, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:07:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91067308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91067308</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plex media server on my desktop running Windows</span><br>That is some peak boomer right there.", "time": 1674461268, "resto": 91067012}, {"no": 91067688, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:08:50", "name": "Anonymous`", "com": "<a href=\"#p91067495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91067495</a><br><a href=\"#p91067633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91067633</a><br><br>RAID Z2, overly simplified, allows 2 of your hard drives to die and you can still access your data, since enough data is on your other drives that your NAS can figure out the missing data on the drives that died.<br><br>You can replace the dead drives with a new one, and then &quot;set up&quot; the new drives so you can go back to being able to have 2 drives die.

Unlike the award-winning NF-F12 and NF-S12A models, which are specialised solutions for specific applications, the NF-A12x25 has been conceived to be a true all-rounder with superior performance in most common configurations: Whereas the NF-F12 is optimised for maximum static pressure and the NF-S12A is optimised for maximum airflow, the pressure to airflow (P/Q) curve of the NF-A12x25 has been carefully fine-tuned in the mid-section that is critical for achieving the best results in all common applications.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The above chart compares the P/Q curves of the three fan models and maps them on sample impedance curves of a typical PC case, heatsink and radiator in order to demonstrate how much air the fans can push through when working against the airflow resistance that these applications represent. As can be seen from the chart, the NF-F12 produces higher maximum static pressure (top left) and the NF-S12A produces higher maximum airflow (bottom right), but at the relevant operating points, namely the impedance curves of the three sample applications, the NF-A12x25 provides a better balance of static pressure and airflow than the other two fans. This is the cornerstone of the NF-A12x25\u2019s superior real-world performance.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kind regards, Kadir G\u00fcrb\u00fcz Your Noctua Support-Team</span><br><a href=\"#p91062295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91062295</a><br>I have it like that exact setup as well (but with Arctic fans) and it works fine.
