It&#039;s a dumber than even the simplest of warm blooded animals. It just has a lot of parameters to correlate text and text only. So because it was trained on a bunch of texts like textbooks written with confidence by experts it talks total bullshit confidently. But people who have no expertise in anything like most people ITT of course think that it&#039;s somthing greater than it actually is.<br><br>Hardware and physics is extremely hard and we are getting close to the limitations of classical designs. Just think about how many servers ChatGPT needs for such a limited behavior. You need to run something a million times complex to have a real android which has an internal representation of abstractions which it can express using a variety of ways like sound, writing, drawing, etc.<br>It is far more likely that at least quantum computers or similar hardware is a prerequisite. To achieve human like motion human like complexity and structure is also needed. So it is far more likely that real life androids will be made with some kind of wetware tech and will be closer to synthetic humans from something like Westworld/Blade Runner than robots.", "time": 1676425632, "resto": 91536029}, {"no": 91545738, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)21:10:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91545343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91545343</a><br>plastics make it possible<br>they make the androids from plastics mainly<br>a plastic chair in plaid is MUCH cheaper and easier to manufacture than a wooden or steel chair of similar structure in plaid<br><br>plastic muscles, nerves, cartilage, fat, skin, special fluid with repair/power substances(make sure to keep your android fresh, powered, fixed, and working with your android fluid changes)<br>3d grow/print the robot, insert the quantum core, upload the software/rom, link to accounts, customize the plastic projection skin/hair/sex organs and more<br><br>one of the main big things that didn&#039;t make sense in-game is people like bronies, furfags, and more customizing their own androids with horns, claws, hooves, and wings and shit", "time": 1676427025, "resto": 91536029}, {"no": 91545976, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)21:23:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91536089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91536089</a><br>what&#039;s the point", "time": 1676427780, "resto": 91536029}, {"no": 91546043, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)21:26:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91536029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91536029</a><br>Pretty far, even dolls are still meh.

Ideally, you want all software managed by your system package manager so that everything has a common interface for installing/removing/updating, and so you don\u2019t end up with multiple copies of a library on your system. Flatpak doesn\u2019t do this. Variability in quality of packages is a serious problem with Flatpaks, roughly comparable with the AUR due to the extremely lax package submission requirements, so many things are packaged incorrectly and will have abysmal performance or not work outright. Performance is also super variable with Flatpaks, quite a bit worse in a lot of cases but much better in some.

Turns out that the reason these grey boxes appear is because DWM enforces a 4-byte pixel format that the game simply wasn&#039;t made for, and if DWM is forced to allocate the game&#039;s native 2-byte pixel format this stupid piece of trashware performs a format conversion upon every single frame using an algorithm that challenges molasses in January in terms of slowness.<br><br>But: entering exclusive fullscreen mode once (ALT+Enter) puts DWM out of the composition loop. Going back into window mode appears to be allocating a portion of screen buffer in the upper left corner into which the game&#039;s window can be placed in order to, for lack of a better word, &quot;capture&quot; the game&#039;s output.

Which is pretty dumb if you do pixel conversion in software, like I assume they do; for a 1024 * 768 pixel surface with 2 bytes per pixel that would be 1.5 MB of data that has to be converted into 3 MB every single frame. My CPU only has 1 MB L1 cache, so those 3 MB would be evicted during step 2 and then reloaded during step 3 - every single frame! If they did step 2 and step 3 after every scanline the amount of data processed would only be 2 KB + 4 KB.<br><br>I absolutely believe this to be the case - why else would CPU usage go up from 2 to 16% just for a simple scanline-per-scanline pixel conversion? Heck, they could&#039;ve used a shader to do the conversion on the GPU and bypass CPU limitations altogether; I&#039;d know because my current solution does just that for scaling (using a 256 x 192 surface internally and doing the scaling and filtering via shader). Brings up CPU usage from 2 to 5%, which is much more reasonable than the monkeyshine that MS is trying to sell me here - after all there still needs to be a conversion done here!<br><br>DWM is complete trashware, and now the pajeets made it so that we cannot turn it off anymore.

They have several repositories you can choose from when you download your install. Debian has rolling release and stable(plus some others I think but those are the 2 main ones). Stable is only updated every 2 years or so, and it&#039;s very stable and tested through, so it doesn&#039;t have the bleeding edge of software. rolling release is updated frequently and you get to enjoy more recent software at the expense of stability and it not being tested through yet.<br>Don&#039;t use all the other ways of installing software like flatpaks and docker and snap and whatever else, unless you really need that software for some reason and you can&#039;t get it through your package manager.<br>Just stick to your package manager or install things from source via git. but learn your package manager first.<br>Then you can begin to rice your distro.<br>for example try installing spacefm if you want a cool filemanager that you can tweak a lot.<br>or maybe try changing your window manager or install a whole desktop environment like xfce.<br>I personally use xfce because it has a lot of options and is easy to use through GUIs, which I personally like.<br><br>If you&#039;ve never dabbled with anything regarding coding, I would recommend you first learn html, then css, then a little bit of python.

However, it has some annoying issues:<br>- standard library is pretty mediocre, and you&#039;ll have to implement many basic constructs in other languages&#039; standard libraries yourself. I see it mostly as a plus, but it&#039;s true that it takes more work.<br>- The compile time computations are extremely limited (or rather, they&#039;re not standarised and you can&#039;t control them very well, even though compilers do use them). This leads to annoying moments where you have to declare a constant as an enum, which is necessarily an int (in C23 we&#039;ll finally be able to choose the type of the enums).<br>- integers have confusing behaviour type promotion and their size isn&#039;t standard on all platforms. Very annoying for portability.<br>- some pretty common tasks that you do are technically undefined behaviour (integer over/underflows, struct packing, bit shifts over a certain amount). At the beginning of C, undefined behaviour just meant &quot;do the thing that makes the most sense on a specific architecture&quot;. Now, it means that the compiler can assume anything and introduce bugs that are VERY hard to find.<br>- A lot of very useful C features are compiler specific: GNU C really does make sense, especially for lower level and highly-optimised stuff, but you lose portability. Newer C standards port some of these things to C, but using them makes your code less portable as well.<br><br>Overall, it&#039;s one of the rare languages that let you control almost everything, and if you implement something in C, you actually do understand it. But it has some flaws that are due to it being the first one to matter for systems programming. C++ helps in some ways, but loses many of the benefits of C in doing so (I like C++, but less).<br>I&#039;d like to see some quirks of C be fixed in future releases (notably with undefined behaviour), but it is so widespread because of a reason", "time": 1676506302, "resto": 91562198}, {"no": 91565934, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)19:35:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91562198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91562198</a><br>I can&#039;t really think of anything that I actively dislike, but I have some suggestions for syntactic sugar.<br><br>In C it&#039;s already possible to put functions inside a struct.

The weird thing is how little you see of this stuff in public. Even the php docs use HTML in PHP, which I have never used/seen in my career at any job I had.
