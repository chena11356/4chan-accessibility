Rust lacks the ability to write functions that are generic over tuple sizes currently. Thus, certain traits are only implemented for tuples up to size 12. In future versions of Rust, we might expect variadic generics to be implemented, so this problem will just go away. But for now, consider other approaches.<br><br>In practice, there&#039;s not much reason to have a tuple with more than maybe 4 elements to begin with. Why? Well, what&#039;s the reason for tuples to exist in the first place? They&#039;re essentially anonymous structs. You&#039;ve got a small handful of variables that need to be returned together or passed to some expression together. They don&#039;t have some logical association with each other for a struct to make sense, and they&#039;re either too small in number or of different types for an array to make sense. So you wrap &#039;em in a tuple and forget about it.<br><br>Now answer me this: when do you have 13 integers that all need to be compared simultaneously, but which don&#039;t have a logical association with each other that could be given a name and put into a type?

The type of traffic would most likely be normal, it be the amount at weird times to look for. The two common ways youd be part of a botnet would be someone infected one of your networks devices and it has become a zombie, transmitting data when requested by the bot master. Or the more common, your IP is on some botnet&#039;s table chart of IPs to relay off. Your network in that case is being sent spoofed return IP address packets with some request or protocol that tells your network device(s) to reply to that spoof address. The spoof address usually being the botnets target. The first example, your device(s) being zombie&#039;d youd have to find the device, then the virus or trojan on it and remove it. The second example, you just have to change IPs. This can be done as easily as ban evading 4cans. The issue may still reside with how your IP got on a botnets IP table.

A pi4 is like $140 here so it&#039;ll cost a decent amount, but the m3x I currently use was $600 so as long as it&#039;s under that I&#039;ll be happy, i guess.<br>Would a compute module be better since it&#039;s smaller? is there a different SBC I could use (I have an orangepi zero 2)?", "time": 1675555521, "resto": 91325810}, {"no": 91342173, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)19:17:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You can enjoy reading while listening to my study playlist!!! <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq4<wbr>AGgqNho8&amp;list=UUxffG5IJz8MXhM2xB0GW<wbr>Omw&amp;index=3", "time": 1675556277, "resto": 91325810}, {"no": 91342195, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)19:19:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How is there such good ai out there these days but nothing for this <a href=\"#p91341108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91341108</a>", "time": 1675556342, "resto": 91325810}, {"no": 91342352, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)19:28:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91329971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91329971</a><br>Even with soldering it&#039;s tough considering those delaminated traces.

What a monitor was capable of when new doesn&#039;t really matter, you&#039;re not going to be impressed by a worn out Electron 22 Blue or Mitsubishi 2070sb. You&#039;re probably going to feel cheated if you paid $1,000 for one of these monitors in mint condition. If you find one for a reasonable price and not too much usage, then great. Most likely you will not. I personally used a Philips 107B for a while. It was a decidedly &quot;OK&quot; monitor when new. No crazy resolutions, no crazy refresh rates, utterly forgettable. But mine was $20 brand new in the box. I actually owned a Dell P1130 for a while, but I ended up selling it because I just liked the Philips tube better. The Dell was theoretically a better monitor when new, but I kept having to fuck around with it constantly to get the right colour, fix the geometry, and wait half an hour for it to properly warm up. The Philips monitor just werked.<br><br>I now have an HP P1230, which is a really good monitor (Diamondtron, Mitsubishi&#039;s own version of Sony Trinitron). Mine has low hours and I got it for free from some boomer who just wanted it out of their basement. Took me years of searching to find something like that for under $200, and only by a stroke of luck- he had listed a desk for sale and I saw the monitor in the photos of this desk. He was actually planning to toss it, so by coming to collect it I saved him a trip to the dump. In the unlikely case that you get a deal like that, great. More likely you will need to &quot;settle&quot; for a reasonable mid-range monitor in the meantime and then upgrade when you have a chance.", "time": 1675495446, "resto": 91326115}, {"no": 91327894, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:30:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91327340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91327340</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic</span><br>Jesus I knew CRT projectors were huge, but that thing is just ridiculous.

I can&#039;t remember all of them, but the Dell P1130 was made in vast quantities and lots of businesses had them. Same with HP P1130s. There were other rebrands too. IBM P275 is probably the most &quot;modern&quot; looking outside of the F series Sonys.<br><br>Depending on your threshold for refresh rate, lower end monitors can be good. 1600x1200 is probably the lowest resolution you&#039;ll want for modern daily use. Probably above 70Hz. That&#039;s why I say shoot for 110kHz+.

The customization options in GNOME are simply incredible, and the open-source community has made sure that the interface is not only functional but also user-friendly.<br><br>Another aspect that has impressed me about Linux is the power of the terminal. The terminal makes it so easy to automate tasks, run commands, and manage my system. The open-source nature of Linux also means that I have access to the source code and can make modifications as I see fit. This level of control and customization is simply unmatched in the world of closed-source operating systems.<br><br>Overall, I have been thoroughly impressed with the performance and flexibility of Linux. No more worrying about being locked into a closed-source ecosystem where I have no control over my machine. If you&#039;re a user of /g/ and looking for a more open and customizable operating system, I cannot recommend Linux and Fedora enough. This OS is perfect for tech-savvy users who value control, customization, and freedom. From its smooth performance to its plethora of customization options, Linux is truly a dream come true for anyone who values open-source software.<br><br>I must say that I was a bit hesitant about making the switch, but it has exceeded all of my expectations.

It\u2019s a causal (unidirectional) transformer pretrained using language modeling on a very large corpus of ~40 GB of text data.<br>   GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.<br>    GPT-2 is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\u2019s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left.<br>    GPT-2 was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective and is therefore powerful at predicting the next token in a sequence. Leveraging this feature allows GPT-2 to generate syntactically coherent text as it can be observed in the run_generation.py example script.", "time": 1675560912, "resto": 91340256}, {"no": 91343397, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)20:36:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://voca.ro/1eASgjXBXchp<br><br>Still robotic sounding but meh.

If you are low on RAM (less than 4 gbs), just disable the built in defender antivirus, and use a third party one, disable Widgets and Teams (saves ram and cpu usage spikes) the used ram will &quot;magically&quot; be the same as tiny11 on a PC with 2GBs of ram. If storage is an issue, but you have at least about 30 gigabytes for the system partition, look up CompactOS (Windows includes it, its an official tool).<br>All of this is easy one time shit. You can keep Windows completely intact, use whatever edition you want, receive security updates.<br>Official Windows 11 installed this way vs tiny11 CPU wise will use the same amount of resources, RAM wise will also use the same amount of resources (!!!), so basically only less disk space used by the OS will be the real improvement (and a significant one) but I dont think anybody should bother if they have at least 30gbs of storage for the os, at least for now<br>Im using Windows 11 this way since it came out on with 2GBs of RAM and an Atom processor, same performance as Windows 10 editions (including LTSC)", "time": 1675598009, "resto": 91348612}, {"no": 91350686, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:56:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "When were you when the idea for basically picrelated went from a meme to a reality shilled by the &quot;tech-savvy&quot;", "filename": "preview-32-1942", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675598169372374, "time": 1675598169, "md5": "L2c9ODQW0R8OTS27QclkgQ==", "fsize": 35299, "resto": 91348612}, {"no": 91350804, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)07:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91350165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91350165</a><br>why who is the retard? should I know him?", "time": 1675598708, "resto": 91348612}, {"no": 91350829, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)07:06:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91349279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91349279</a><br>this<br>ever since I installed Education I&#039;ve literally stopped thinking about my OS altogether", "time": 1675598812, "resto": 91348612}, {"no": 91350864, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)07:09:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91349138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91349138</a><br>They&#039;re literally just running it through ntLite, removing a bunch of shit, integrating a bunch of shit, and calling it a day.

All that just to give you an idea of what she puts into it and gets out of it.<br><br>QRD: She ended up buying an off the shelf machine targeted at people who didn&#039;t want to fuck with electronics. I think you could save a lot of money buying a more &quot;hacker&quot; oriented machine/parts if you can tinker. Her bread and butter and the product that just prints for her is cutting boards. She buys massive numbers of blank cutting boards for super cheap, takes an order for a custom board, does a quick 2D graphic with like their family name and a heart or whatever the fuck, the machine engraves it in a few minutes, and then the boards sells at an obscene margin. Her other high margin stuff is similar; pizza peels or anything that&#039;s a blank and ready-to-sell wood product she can engrave with a simple 2D graphic and turn around for some live-laugh-love type bitch on social media. She does more complicated prints that are like multi-layered ornaments, but it&#039;s a lot more work to design, a lot more niche, harder for clients to articulate, and way lower margin considering time. Either way, she runs her business just posting example stuff on social media and soliciting orders for personalized, similar stuff.<br><br>The other guy is huffing copium, though, it&#039;s a huge business.", "time": 1675565174, "resto": 91339747}, {"no": 91344557, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:55:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91342275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91342275</a><br>IDK, the lastest and greatest brushless impact is always fun to play with.

Import Taxes: The Australian government imposes import taxes on many goods, including computer components, which adds to the overall cost of these products.<br><br>3.

But these techniques add a fuckton of cost and labour. Any imperfections will be amplified tenfold and parts have to be connected on edges or undersides as any cut will reveal the original underlying plastics. Those who care about metal looks will paint their kits themselves anyway, so the marbling is a nice compromise to keep things affordable.

I tried to test a handful of different ME firmware versions, but surprisingly, the wifi module never worked on any of those images, even when the ME was not neutralized. Obviously, it meant that the ME firmware was not properly configured, so I used the Intel FIT tool (which is used to configure ME images, allowing us to set things like PCIe lanes, and which clocks to enable, and all of that).

I started my 2nd attempt at an operating system on the first of January as my new year&#039;s resolution. 6 years ago I started wrting an OS and the community I went to chat with others doing the same urged me to write a comprehensive bootloader, to support both BIOS boot and UEFI, and to test it on real hardware. Turned out to be a horrid combination of simple but tedious. I gave up because it was so damned boring.<br>It&#039;s not even like it was for any gain - the bootloader runs once then fucks off. So the &quot;but this way it&#039;s only MY code running on the machnie&quot; doesn&#039;t hold water, because the bootloader fucks off. It&#039;s an even more invalid point because the system firmware also ran, so it&#039;s NOT only &#039;your own code&#039; running, and in fact the system firmware sticks around too.<br>So this time around I made the decision to get straight to work on what I was actually interested in - the scheduler, synchronization, and IPC. I&#039;ve built multilevel feedback queue with three priority classes - one for interrupts, one for realtime, and one for normal processes, each with 32 priority levels. Almost all hardware interrupts are handled by a special kind of lightweight kernel thread I&#039;ve called a threadlet, which simplifies coding dramatically - mutexes, semaphores, monitors, and message queues are available for synchronizing everywhere. I have mitigated priority inversion through a system of propagated priority inheritance, which is essential since interrupt threads use these high-level synchronization mechanisms instead of relying on spinlocks.<br>And I completely ignored people who said I need to write a bootloader. I found a simple bootloader called bootboot which puts you straight into x86_64 mode so you don&#039;t need to fuck with decades of legacy bullshit in modern PCs. Now I&#039;ve got something I feel proud of already.

Thus, according to Ilja Zemstov, a former professor of sociology at the Lenin Institute of Baku (Azerbaijan), writing in 1976, one in two retired persons in the Soviet Union lived in poverty, and in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, 75 percent of the population lived below the poverty line and there were more homes without water, electricity, and toilets than in the whole of Western Europe.

Among the foreign firms that flocked to the Soviet Union with their technicians, machinery, and capital were famous names like General Electric, Westinghouse, Singer, Du Pont, Ford, Standard Oil, Siemens, International Harvester, Alcoa, Singer, Krupp, Otto Wolf, and many others, including important British, French, Swedish, Danish, and Austrian companies.

It&#039;s basically indistinguishable from bilinear but uses up more resources. Chroma upscaling should always be a sharp interpolation filter because softer filters like bilinear will create a smudged and inaccurate upscale, and ringing on the chroma channel is imperceptible anyways because ringing on the chroma just adds to the perceived sharpness of an image, which is good. Since lanczos is an interpolation filter, it won&#039;t fuck with the color-mapping of the image so it&#039;s safe to use.<br><br>Luma upscaling filters are definitely a personal preference, but the only real choices are ewa_lanczossharp and bilinear. Bilinear won&#039;t create or amplify artifacts, and it&#039;s fast as fuck. ewa_lanczossharp is not only the MOST sharp filter, but it creates the least amount of ringing artifacts out of all of the sharpening filters due to having ideal Jinc parameters (under sigmoidal light of course). The only downside is that it takes a lot of system resources if you have a potato.
