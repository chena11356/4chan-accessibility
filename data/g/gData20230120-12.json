I think one could reserve the top 1gb for the Unix kernel, and the next lower 1gb for Unix apps (though I don&#039;t know if the 68k MMUs deny user-mode access to the upper half of memory, if so that complicates matters) and that should work fine.

Power source can either try to maintain a constant voltage or constant amperage, usually the former, up to maximum load (whatever it&#039;s trying to keep constant will vary a bit anyway).

Software is installed as root but run as a non-root user, so software can&#039;t even modify itself.<br>Our software is not normally bundled like it is on windows, and that means the libraries are actually &quot;shared&quot; between a lot of software like it&#039;s intended to be and upgrading that library simultaneously upgrades all software on the system.<br>So you almost never have random outdated libs lying around from old software on your system, which is the cause of probably &gt;90% of windows vulnerabilities.<br><br>So as long as you use the package manager to install your software you&#039;re pretty damn safe. Unless the repo itself is compromised, but if you&#039;re that paranoid there are ultra-autistic distros that can protect you from even your own package maintainers if you want to put in the effort.<br><br>The biggest vulnerability on GNU/Linux is 3rd party software you download outside the repo, like Steam games for example.

For Wayland, you might need this tool in specific: https://github.com/pedro00dk/nvidia<wbr>-exec.

Group Policy sets values in the registry, that then set other values - for example, there&#039;s a policy to force a certain wallpaper, which will set something in the *\\Policies\\* subkeys, which will ultimately map down to setting HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop!Wallpaper.<br><br>Why do they do it this way? Firstly, the Policies keys in the registry are ACL protected, so only administrators can change them: this is what makes them &quot;policy&quot; rather than just &quot;configuration&quot;. Secondly, programs can also check the values in Policies to see if they&#039;re policy, and put up large friendly warnings that &quot;This option is configured by your administrator&quot; and/or lock out configuration screens. Thirdly, because the &quot;real&quot; setting is in the Policies keys, the real value is always available, and if they user is clever enough to (say) edit the registry and write their own value to HKCU, it&#039;ll be overwritten in the next Group Policy update.<br><br>Now, onto your problem: because you had no doubt set the policy in Group Policy Editor to &quot;Disabled&quot;, this will actively remove any configured policy on the subject - so during a Group Policy update, any registry values outside of the Policies subtree connected to the policy would be removed.

The best argument against it is that it&#039;s still not that effective as a tactic and telling people that they can improve the sound of most headphones at literally no cost is a surprisingly hard sell, often they would much rather spend more money and get benefits that are largely imaginary. This is how the audio industry has always worked and it can be hard to come to terms with, many real audiophiles have lived out their whole lives with no real improvements. <br><br>However things are slowly changing. More value is being placed on measurements which means in the near future we may actually be able to buy headphones that are good enough that EQ is of no real benefit, note I don&#039;t mean Harman tuning but that&#039;s a whole different discussion.

Not because anything&#039;s broken, I just wanted to report some more things about them.<br>I don&#039;t use them as extensively as most people probably do, but I have yet to burn through the charge on the case (in almost a month). The buds themselves I can attest last at least 2 and a half hours, maybe more but I haven&#039;t worn them for that long in one go. If you used them this long every day you&#039;d probably burn through the charge of the case much quicker, I think it eats up like 6% or 7% for that amount of time.<br>One of them sits a bit flimsily in my ear, not a huge deal but if I&#039;m wearing a hood I get anxious about it falling out.<br>And my initial thoughts on the touch controls remain the same, they&#039;re awful. They only work in one small center part of the earphones, which does at least mean that once you know how you can semi-reliably avoid touching them when you put them in your ears. But actually using them? Don&#039;t.

But someone attaching himself to some other corporation that offers the same shitty service to everyone is just so fucking pathetic.

Rust programmers aren&#039;t, the compiler can check it and worst case scenario you do a copy.<br>C++ programmers struggle with data races because people don&#039;t understand what shared_ptr does and doesn&#039;t synchronize or forget that a property was implemented as a bitflag. Rust checks it for you and catches these mistakes.<br>C++ makes trivial everyday code risky, Rust limits the risk to FFI and container implementations and such. And you can see the results in practice, Rust projects really do have fewer issues.

Those are Genelec 8020s. The 8010s are not an option imho and yes they work well as desktop speakers. Since I am depressed I do not record any music lately and they are very nice for listening. Yo will miss some deep bass without a subwoofer but I do not care since I have a bigger setup in the living room.

Do not believe audiofools who say there is a dynamic headphone that is way better than that. I do not really listen to music with headphones so I did not buy a pair of hd600s again.

Have you listened to those speakers in a nearfield setup? Behringer does not really tune the fr very well prolly because those speakers are quite cheap and the casing, waveguide and drivers are pretty old designs which are okay but I would not want a 2 way setup with an 8 inch driver going that low in a near field situation, but that is probably just my autism. Of axis characteristics are also where better designs show their worth but who cares. I could probably mod the truths and make them more &quot;neutral&quot; but I aint got no time for that and I would not trust their electronics to be bullet proof. Do not get me wrong great value but used genelecs or khs can be great value as well. You can get a 310 sometimes really cheap at least here and that is a proper closed 3way design and really nice for nearfield. The genelec coax are as good as it gets but since my hearing is going to shit anyways I cannot really justify spending 8 grand on speakers before buying a house.

I also had at least 4 folders completely vanish, like there isnt even a trace of them I can access, its like the folder and everything inside was deleted (and I double checked my recycling bin, they are not there). So im assuming those files/folders that wont open and the ones completely missing are not readable on the physical section of the external drive. My theory, is that from what I recall, each of those folders and files had some little diagrams either in them on attached that I had made in MS paint and for whatever reason, thats causing the fuck up, because I noted it was all files/folders I recall having them (though some not embedded into the Word Document were recoverable).

Personally I find it therapeutic when I do manage to get out of the house and being completely disconnected from it while just soaking in the reality around me. I&#039;m on my desktop literally most of my free time. I don&#039;t really have a social life as people tend to avoid me because of my viewpoints with technology. I started to refuse to have full conversations around people who carried smartphones and valued my friends who would leave their phones at home or at least in their cars if we went for walks or hung out somewhere. Sadly, as the years went by more and more people who were my friends couldn&#039;t live without social media and their cell phones ignoring anything that I attempted to warn them about. Same happened with my family and now I can&#039;t even visit family without them all huddled around in a room talking about their Facebook feeds. I stopped going to holiday gatherings completely. I even set up an email to keep in touch with those who wanted to talk to me. Not one person be it past friends or family have ever sent me any messages. Instead they were simply only interested in messaging me if I had a Facebook account and the younger relatives would ask me about Instagram. Not listening to any advice or warnings I had. I never told them to flat out not own or use things just what these services were doing with their data and how much of a privacy concern it really is. Politely asking if they wanted me to discuss specific topics or to have real personal discussions to please not carry it with them, simple.

Personally I find it therapeutic when I do manage to get out of the house and being completely disconnected from it while just soaking in the reality around me. I&#039;m on my desktop literally most of my free time. I don&#039;t really have a social life as people tend to avoid me because of my viewpoints with technology. I started to refuse to have full conversations around people who carried smartphones and valued my friends who would leave their phones at home or at least in their cars if we went for walks or hung out somewhere. Sadly, as the years went by more and more people who were my friends couldn&#039;t live without social media and their cell phones ignoring anything that I attempted to warn them about. Same happened with my family and now I can&#039;t even visit family without them all huddled around in a room talking about their Facebook feeds. I stopped going to holiday gatherings completely. I even set up an email to keep in touch with those who wanted to talk to me. Not one person be it past friends or family have ever sent me any messages. Instead they were simply only interested in messaging me if I had a Facebook account and the younger relatives would ask me about Instagram. Not listening to any advice or warnings I had. I never told them to flat out not own or use things just what these services were doing with their data and how much of a privacy concern it really is. Politely asking if they wanted me to discuss specific topics or to have real personal discussions to please not carry it with them, simple.

In terms of what it does I suppose I should be clearer. I think computers can ve classified as specific-purpose computers or general-purpose computers. The DevTerm is a good example of a specific-purpose computer. If you want a nice, ultra-mobile environment to write and compile LaTeX documents, it might literally be the best computer in the world for that owing to its nice keyboard and wide screen which give like a 2 monitor workflow to a UMPC which I think is unique to that device currently. If you want a computer which basically just bootstraps you into Chrome so use can use social media or into Steam so you can play games, I do not think the DevTerm would even be capable of it. So I wonder, is this a UMPC or is it a digital typewriter? I am inclined to call it a UMPC because it can run gfortran and gcc and other compilers. If it had no access to compilers I wouldn&#039;t call it a UMPC.<br><br>Steak Deck is another UMPC-ish machine that qualifies as a specific-purpose computer. It&#039;s job is run Steam games. I don&#039;t know if it can run compilers. I will assume the answer is yes. I still would not call the Steam Deck a UMPC, because it has no good way to get input without attaching peripherals, or worse, docking it. It is a game console that can run a C compiler by happenstance, not a machine designed to make doing so comfy. Consequently Steam Deck is not a UMPC. It is a games console.<br><br>I think to call it a UMPC you should be able to operate it with no peripherals, and it should be able to compile.<br><br>The GPD Win 3/4 could be seen as a general-purpose UMPC.

Under a certain threshold is specific-purpose, above it, general-purpose.
