It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.<br>A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.<br>Setup<br>We used Python 3.9.9 and PyTorch 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.10 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably HuggingFace Transformers for their fast tokenizer implementation and ffmpeg-python for reading audio files. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:<br>pip install -U openai-whisper<br>Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:<br>pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisp<wbr>er.git <br>To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:<br>pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisp<wbr>er.git<br>It also requires the command-line tool ffmpeg to be installed on your system", "filename": "open ai whisper transcription", "ext": ".png", "w": 2973, "h": 2253, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1675426396308823, "time": 1675426396, "md5": "WANnwlm6FQVg9IgQ5b0wew==", "fsize": 830225, "resto": 91306833}, {"no": 91310661, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:14:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91310544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91310544</a><br>torrent of relevant information is an excellent idea", "time": 1675426485, "resto": 91306833}, {"no": 91310678, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:16:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "these threads are clueless and will get nothing done.<br>several days in and different anons &#039;discover&#039; teh same shit people found in the first thread.<br>4ch is not the platform for this. goldfish development.", "time": 1675426567, "resto": 91306833}, {"no": 91310691, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:17:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91310639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91310639</a><br>Majority of papers will be open access anyway, if not directly then via arxiv.org.

I&#039;ve been tracking the voldy venv in my own version control because it helps with keeping a stable install and debugging all the random problems that happen whenever you update something. I just noticed today that every time you boot with the Dynamic Prompts extension installed, Voldy first rolls back the http &quot;requests&quot; library in the venv folder to the version it wants, which is 2.25.1. Then Dynamic Prompts updates it to 2.28.2. This happens every time you boot the webui - presumably it would prevent the entire program from running offline when dynamic prompts is installed (haven&#039;t confirmed but likely). I tried changing Voldy to requests ver. 2.28.2 instead but pip refused to resolve the requirements file then because it says another dep, &quot;clean-fid&quot;, requires version 2.25.1. So every time web UI boots this dependency lib &quot;clean-fid&quot; is having its own dependency silently updated to a new version that it claims not to support, because of the way pip merrily overwrites existing libs in the same venv with new ones when you install more than one thing.

Imagine them like a box that holds your video. There are 2 important things that matter for reducing size. The first is bitrate; that is, how many bits per second your video has. The second is the encoder, which is a sort of algorithm that takes a video input and tries to efficiently compress the data in a variety of ways. <br>Generally, the more compressed you try to make your video and preserving as much quality as possible, the longer the encode process will take.<br>For example, say your source video is a 2GB movie with a bitrate of 8000kbps (8M for short), and its encoder is h264 (most common encoder). You can try to reduce the size strictly by reducing the bitrate, which will likely lead to a perceptible quality loss, or you can reduce the bitrate AND switch to a more efficient encoder like vp9 or av1. These more modern encoders have a caveat that they&#039;re generally slower, but they can net you serious savings in space. It takes some experimentation to see what you like in terms of speed, quality, and bitrate tradeoffs, but I can start you off with a baseline to work with for av1:<br><br>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libsvtav1 -c:a copy -crf 40 -preset 4 output.webm<br><br>This will take your input (just swap the file name and type), convert it to av1, and target a constant rate factor (crf) of 40. The preset option is sort of like a slider for quality in exchange for speed. Lower is more efficient and higher quality but slower to encode, and higher is less efficient and lower quality but faster.

I wanted to bring to your attention some serious security concerns with the internal customer and records management system that we are planning to move to the cloud.<br><br>As I&#039;m contracted here to work on the codebase, I have identified the following problems:<br><br>1. Half of the endpoints are not restricted to authorized users, which poses a significant security risk.<br><br>2. A lot of the logic is currently done client-side, which could make the system vulnerable to tampering, data manipulation and access of privileged data.<br><br>3. There is a potential for SQL injection, which could lead to data breaches and the exposure of sensitive information.<br><br>4. The system contains a wealth of employee and customer personal information, including Social Security numbers, and if this information were to be leaked, it would have serious consequences.<br><br>I believe it is imperative that we address these security issues before we move the system to the cloud. I would be happy to work with the development team to find solutions to these problems and ensure that the system is secure before we make the transition.<br><br>Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>[Your name]", "time": 1675248583, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266542, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:58:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266411</a>", "filename": "1613075249348", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 219, "h": 254, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675249096905793, "time": 1675249096, "md5": "4oCjg7qjOiGeQaufaLFX/A==", "fsize": 8158, "resto": 91265712}, {"no": 91266669, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)06:13:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91266464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266464</a><br><a href=\"#p91266452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91266452</a><br>They already know.

Immediately regretting this choice I went into the settings and removed this simple mistake.  Except I didn&#039;t, because as far as I can tell, there is no way to remove words from the dictionary.

That button closes the window, not the program.</span><br>That is the behavior all windowed environments use, including Windows and the various toolkits on Linux and BSD.<br><br>The reason Windows applications in particular appear to behave differently and exit on closing the window, leading retards in this thread thinking macOS is somehow special in this, is simply how Windows applications typically handle their &quot;main&quot; window. Any application can create any number of windows (top level or otherwise) in any number of threads, each thread having its own message loop. When a window is being destroyed it receives a WM_DESTROY message. A &quot;main&quot; window&#039;s handler for that is supposed to invoke PostQuitMessage, which sends WM_QUIT directly to the thread. That causes the thread&#039;s message loop call to GetMessage() to &quot;fail&quot;, indicating the application (or at least thread) should exit. It does not have to.<br><br>macOS has a different mechanism for starting applications in which apps are expected to execute and start up to a point but then wait for &quot;activation&quot; before showing any UI. Closing the window closes the UI, exactly the same way as on other platforms, but on other platforms applications also exit after that because there&#039;s no &quot;reactivation&quot; mechanism.

This has been my experience and the experience of the few technically oriented guys I know from the course. You will learn a lot about patterns etc. in work regardless, even if it&#039;s what not to do. You might get lucky and have a decent employer where management/HR care about your development and give you roles according to your apirations, but don&#039;t bank on this. Business comes first and you&#039;ll be at the bottom of the pecking order, especially in the beginning.<br>Whether you need to finish or not depends on your contract. It goes without saying but make sure you read and understand every word of any contract they give you before signing, some put very nasty clauses in for this kind of position.<br>Providing no contractual constraints to the contrary, and even then if you&#039;re smart/quiet about it you might be able to sneak away to a competitor without incident, then nothing is stopping you from leaving after a year.

Your employer should give you a fair bit of time to dedicate to study, don&#039;t want this. Even if you don&#039;t has assignments to work on for your qualifications, take the time and study, work on personal projects etc. You likely won&#039;t be given windows like this in the future to just grind without sacrificing stuff in real life so take them when they&#039;re offered - it will pay off.<br>Which company are you looking at?

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \u201cLinux\u201d distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</span>", "filename": "1675421672586", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675421687439445, "time": 1675421687, "md5": "39BlPJ5eIk4Jdg87yIDmYw==", "fsize": 112839, "resto": 91304572}, {"no": 91310393, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91304572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91304572</a><br>Its kernel not OS retard", "time": 1675425069, "resto": 91304572}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 91308380, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hey /g/ how do I unlock a Mac Pro that&#039;s in this state? got fired but have documents I need access to and the fuckers aren&#039;t letting me in. command+R at start up isn&#039;t working", "filename": "20230203_022735", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 3000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1675412997331605, "time": 1675412997, "md5": "fed1iZVrktQLKV5ttU0ZIg==", "fsize": 2470146, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hey-g-how-do-i-unlock-a-mac-pro-thats-in-this", "replies": 28, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 91308398, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:31:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "fuck sorry for the auto rotate, was too lazy to email pic to myself.", "time": 1675413070, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91308659, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91308380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91308380</a><br>Give it back, Jamal", "time": 1675414763, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309010, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:37:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91308659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91308659</a><br>i&#039;m not even black lol. my fucking tax documents are on there and the company is being a bitch. granted I was fired about four months ago but still. shit sucks.", "time": 1675417055, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309028, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:40:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just remove the eeprom with the password on it, dump it to another computer, remove the password in a hex editor, and then write it back to the eeprom.", "time": 1675417244, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309059, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "give it back rasheed", "time": 1675417456, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309063, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Give it back Tyquan", "time": 1675417486, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309119, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:49:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91309028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91309028</a><br>not a clue how to go about that (not a mac person) but I&#039;ll look into this route. thank you anon", "time": 1675417787, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309137, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:51:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m surprised there aren&#039;t pop-up shops that are willing to crack these and other bios-locked laptops for a fee.", "time": 1675417863, "resto": 91308380}, {"no": 91309167, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:54:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91309119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91309119</a><br>The same principles apply to all laptops, as long as you know how to work with surface mounted devices then it should be a piece of piss.

Activation tags are &quot;nigger&quot; for, well, niggers, &quot;kike&quot; for generic jews, and &quot;merchant&quot; for specifically merchant faced jews. It does a decent job generating those 3 characters, more thorough tagging might allow it to more consistently generate different characters like Trump and Hillary but I was too lazy to tag everything. I used WD 1.4 convnext-v2-git to tag (which worked surprisingly well despite the images not being danbooru like at all), then pruned out some tags that were common to almost every image and added the aforementioned three tags to appropriate images. I trained it against plain SD 1.5 but it works alright with NAI derivatives too. It might be worth retraining against NAI just to get better anatomy... Another thing I thought of was appending a BLIP interrogation to each tag file since that&#039;s closer to the kind of prompt that vanilla SD is used to, but I thought it might be rather noisy token wise to do both that and WD1.4 so I decided against it.

A lock-free data structure is not wait-free.  It&#039;s lock-free, which is a strictly weaker condition than being wait-free.  Lock-freedom means that at least one thread can always make progress in finite time whereas wait-freedom means that all threads can make progress in finite time.  Usually an operation is lock-free but not wait-free because a thread making progress (e.g. by successfully executing a CAS) will cause other threads to fail to make progress (e.g. by causing their CAS to fail since the location was updated by the thread that made progress).  It&#039;s true that any lock-free operation can be converted into a wait-free operation, but this will cause a massive decrease in performance overall that will only improve their worst-case performance in cases that are usually pathological and overall makes the tradeoff rarely worth it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Using compare exchange, exchange add etc. isn&#039;t &quot;lock free&quot;, it&#039;s &quot;wait free&quot;.</span><br>There&#039;s a lot more nuance to it than this.  It&#039;s common for hardware to provide at least one wait-free atomic synchronization instruction, such as CAS.  Herhily proved that you can implement any synchronization operation in a wait-free manner with CAS, but this does not mean that simply using CAS means you&#039;re implementing a wait-free operation.  It&#039;s more common to use a so-called CAS loop to implement other operations like fetch-and-add, multi-word CAS or methods for concurrent data structures, but CAS loops are only lock-free.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Lock free&quot; describes synchronization without locking mechanisms, which can be achieved in other ways.</span><br>The correct term for this is &quot;non-blocking&quot;.
