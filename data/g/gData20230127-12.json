For example, each object has complete control over their own rendering, but they receive RELATIVE coordinates and dimensions from their parent window lens. So say an image editor wants to display itself fullscreen, if it&#039;s a child of the current screen object then it takes up the entire monitor, but if it&#039;s a child of another smaller window object then it just takes up the whole area of that smaller window. In other words, divs and CSS, but dynamic.</span><br>In more detail, the lens/head editor decides what information to give to the children and what limits to set on them before they&#039;re allowed to render themselves. This can range from a hint &quot;try to be less than 300px wide&quot; to a hard limit &quot;I&#039;ll only render 300px wide screens&quot;. Have the parent and children communicate with each other to decide how they&#039;re all going to share space.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mean you need a screen/frame/window editor for a proper editing program anyway, might as well go full generic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally I&#039;d go for a graph instead of a tree, so whatever the currently selected node is is the &quot;head&quot; and all it&#039;s neighbors are children. &quot;Descending&quot; the tree actually rotates it and the old head is now a child of the new head, which is free to display it as any other child or as a special case to emulate a tree. The reason to do that is to avoid window jiggering and layout multiplying, since with a directed graph you can &quot;swap layouts&quot;, &quot;rotate&quot; through windows, etc...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And also a directed graph is literally hypertext so that plus the divs and layout editor is just DNS+HTML+CSS+JS all in pure CL.</span><br>yes, his description kind of sounds like ReactJS, but using Prototype-based programming instead of Hooks or normal OO-classes, let&#039;s see what comes out of that...", "time": 1674721711, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91129298, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:29:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91129285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91129285</a><br>sorry, the text on top should be all quoted, not one line unquoted", "time": 1674721787, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91129928, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:27:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "emac man", "filename": "unknown-24", "ext": ".png", "w": 997, "h": 901, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1674725261949786, "time": 1674725261, "md5": "VFZfx9D2mAvd4V6lC76YOA==", "fsize": 1529457, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91130146, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)04:46:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;another attempt to go back to emacs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need to use windows tho</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wsl so I don&#039;t have to deal with compatibility issues</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spacemacs for good docs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good performance as well</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very motivated this time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cut through evil tutor like it&#039;s butter</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;add lsp-mode and typescript layer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;navigate to project, gets recognized immediately cause git</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;typescript so lsp kicks in and offers to install eslint automatically</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is amazing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lel invalid string argument nil</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtf.jpg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh, right, eslint is an node thing, it probably needs a node environment and npm for this, my bad</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;install it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;same error message</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well, gonna try the windows one I guess</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too many files open</span><br>COME ON.<br>This has been such an amazing experience.

It&#039;s obviously concise, and I think it&#039;s solid idiomatic Clojure and it&#039;s not &quot;unreadable&quot; (to other Clojure programmers).  But I wouldn&#039;t rate particularly readable, especially compared to idiomatic Python.  Clojure tends to be less readable to a general programming audience, specifically because of all the special functions like repeatedly, rand-nth, take, and partition-by, not to mention the lambdas.  But those are also some of the reasons why Clojure is such a joy to use, and the result is clean and beautiful not some obfuscated nonsense like Perl golf.  But it&#039;s still not as readable as the Python.<br><br>The core issue is that the problem itself is intuitively imperative.  For good readability, the ideal answer to the question &quot;what is this code doing?&quot; should align as closely as possible with both the problem description and the implementation with as little accidental complexity as necessary.  A reader should see that it&#039;s simulating a sequence of coin tosses and counting the streaks.  The English used to describe the problem uses imperative language, most likely because the model is easy for people to understand.  The Python code is simply a step-by-step description of how an abstract computer solves that problem.  The Python code uses only simple operations (math, assignment) and standard flow control to solve the problem, meaning anyone with basic knowledge of programming will be able to read it.<br><br>The Clojure version turns the naturally imperative problem into a sequence of list transformations with some additional special sauce to generate the problem set and the thread macro to avoid having a deep nest of function calls.  So anyone trying to figure out what this code is doing will first have to work out the new and different approach to the problem, as well as unpacking exactly what each filter/transformation does.", "time": 1674786768, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91146682, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:38:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91146619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91146619</a><br>are average programmers really that retarded?", "time": 1674787131, "resto": 91123137}, {"no": 91146704, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:40:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91146682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91146682</a><br>It&#039;s not about being retarded or not.

A bit woofy, loose, not well-defined. Not the most incisive, clean slam. There is not an issue with mid bass bleed, but too much sub bass volume for my taste causes some masking issues and can be distracting. Bass response is quick, just not very detailed and textured. Not at all neutral bass.<br>Mids: Nothing notable which is a good thing. No significant recess or anything wonky, even-keeled and smooth. Mids are behind overall in the soundstage with respect to the elevation of bass and treble. Male and female vocals sound good. No spectacular sound layering/separation, but admirable for the price. Good transients. No smearing on complex tracks, the driver is quite speedy and detailed from mids through upper treble. Solid imaging and depth to the sound.<br>Treble: Treble quality and tuning is great! Piano, brass, wind, and string all sound clear and lively while retaining natural tonality. Good transients apply here as well. Tracks with a lot of treble detail and nuance sound great. Female singing is forward, but appropriate dips help mitigate excessive shout or metallic edge.

While I note that treble is the star-of-the-show for C3, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. For me, the upper mids/treble is pushed a little too forward, which is not my preference for daily driver. Good for a clear and bright sound, but not my pick for extended listening.<br>As far as aesthetics, they both look really cool in-person and online images don&#039;t do them justice. It does appear to be real carbon fiber used in both faceplate designs. Pseudocustom resin like these are uncommon at lower prices, and their build and finish are great. I see no imperfections or signs of poor manufacturing. They both share good ergonomic qualities of being lightweight, well-designed to fit ears, comfortable, and stable.

Without having heard them (I have Aria Snow Edition) I&#039;m speaking out of my ass, but general consensus is that C2 and C3 are good enough sounding IEMs to compete with those older options. I imagine C3 is a very slight improvement over OG Aria and T3+ (at a lower price, w/ better cable), but whether that makes it a priority pick in the highly competitive sub-$100 segment is tough to say. <br>Conclusion:<br>Tinhifi C3 is a moderate V-shape/U-shape IEM with solid technicalities. You will enjoy it if you like an exciting, engaging listen where you are immersed in the bass and treble. Electronic dance, future pop synth, lo-fi, MIDI, modern pop, modern hip-hop, rock, classical instrumental/orchestral suite all synergize well with C3 tuning. You should probably skip C3 if you like a more neutral, flat listen. If you are adverse to brighter vocals and treble, listen to older pop, older/poorly mixed vocal-centric music, or other genres where over-emphasized bass is not ideal, C3 is not the choice for you. Overall, it\u2019s solid!

Sadly, it looks like I need Shoko Server for it to actually work, which in turn requires something called Docker if I am to put it on Ubuntu/Linux, which is where Jellyin is actually installed (been using the web UI on Windows 7, as the actual app refuses to install). I&#039;m not the least bit confident enough with Putty to install both Shoko Server and Docker via SSH, so I may need to find ample time to switch around the peripherals in order to actually see what&#039;s going on.

I&#039;ll see how this goes for a half a year at the longest as per your suggestion. Though it&#039;ll be a pain in the ass if I&#039;m ultimately not satisfied.

However I like that type of treble extension in a lot of music and for non-music so it&#039;s not something I hold against the 770. Actually it&#039;s a bit refreshing because it&#039;s normal for manufacturers to play it too safe in that area, e.g. the HD 600, since it decreases the likelihood of returns. Pad wear typically reduces it further so from a consumer perspective that isn&#039;t great and I think it&#039;s better to have too much than too little.

Some earlier laws are so literal, it may actually state the technology, application, or even fucking language/version (build this thing, and it can only run on Java 6).<br>2.Unions/Boomers: You&#039;ll end up with boomers that refuse to modernize and want to do things the way they always did it when they started the job.

Regulations: Can be law or industry specific. In the US, we have insane privacy laws that make handling of medical shit near impossible and insane hoops to jump through. As a result, shit that broke through the regulations to be used at the time isn&#039;t upgraded. How you end up with 20-25 year old software and terribly non-modern protocols.

The first is the risk of scratching up the lenses beyond repair. This happens the moment you have the cleaner running and allow the lenses to touch the walls of the cleaner, or when you have other loose items or hard debris in it. These scratches happen near instantly and pretty much can&#039;t be fixed. The second issue comes from using aggressive cleaning solutions which eat away at coatings, glues or acrylic frames. Mild hand soap is about as harsh you want to go for regular cleaning, diluted blue spirits is what opticians use but should never be used regulary as it will eat away at coatings. But all of this is assuming you&#039;re buying a proper ultrasonic cleaner, and not some bullshit Chinese plastic tub with a N64 rumble pack pressed against it.<br><br>Personally I just use tap water to rinse of dirt and a clean microfiber cloth for my daily cleaning. If that&#039;s not enough I&#039;ll use a Zeiss wet wipe or blue spirits diluted with demineralised water if things are really bad.

For this build I used DSPIAE nippers, Revell needle tip plastic cement, Olfa hobby knife blades, and black and brown Gundam panel liners.<br><br>Included in the box are runners made of quality hard plastics that don&#039;t get stress marks easily, multiple sets of 1x2mm water slide decals for the eyes, and the build manual. The build itself was straightforward with clear 3D lined instructions. You start with the core/inner frame, but just like with the robomaid Yui kit you have to disassemble the head and forearms and replace them with the actual armored pieces. I simply skipped those parts of the core to save time. All pieces are snap-on or slide-in, but some smaller pieces such as the red pearl, thighs and sphinx&#039;s beard fall off easily during handling. You can be patient and keep reattaching those items or just glue them in place like I did.<br><br>Articulation is surprisingly nice. There are ball joints in the head, lower back, upper legs, shoulders, feet and hands. The knees are double jointed allowing for a full 180 bend. The elbows are basic hinge joints. Finally there are also swivel joints in the the upper arms and upper legs allowing for rotation on top of the ball joint movement.<br><br>In terms of accessories you get a floor and a backdrop, a throne, 3 weapons, wings for Esis which you can also fold up and attach to the throne, and a transformable sphinx/sarcophagus. You can also replace the spinx&#039;s head with the upper torso of Esis if that&#039;s your thing. The floor and backdrop can be reversed with one side being robo-egyptian themed and the other being the default style from the other Fiftyseven kits. All in all, I&#039;d say this kit was definitely worth it despite it&#039;s small size. The robomaid Yui kit felt lackluster as it focused more on clothing options, where this Esis focuses more on aesthetics and accessories.<br><br>8/10, can&#039;t wait to see what robowaifu they release next.", "filename": "esis", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674676266388480, "time": 1674676266, "md5": "HKkMg/w8sPHByK1J0PkAzA==", "fsize": 317682, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91119066, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:10:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "there&#039;s no way i get memed with the vat, right?", "time": 1674681035, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91119909, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:50:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91117559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91117559</a><br>Is the color really this different?

How do i avoid damaging them when cutting? do i need any of these fancy things?</span><br>Quality nippers allow you to neatly remove parts from the runner (sheet of parts). Often these cuts will be barely visible, if visible at all. To achieve a perfect cut you want to cut each part twice. The first cut 2mm away from the part, the second flush to the part. This greatly reduces the risk of getting stress marks (ie plastic turning white) and nubs (remaining pieces of runner on part).<br><br>Hobby knives are mostly just nice to have to clean up cuts gone wrong or remove accidental nubs. Any cheap set will do, I just prefer Olfa blades as they are sharp as fuck and hold their edge.<br><br>Plastic cement is not required to build this kit. I just didn&#039;t had the patience to deal with the parts that repeatedly came off and already had it laying around from previous builds.<br><br>Panel liners are an easy way of adding depth and shadows to parts by tracing edges and grooves and then wiping off excess ink. The effect is pretty noticeable when you compare the pictures. Fineliners and pencils can achieve a similar effect but don&#039;t play nice with all plastics so do try it on a spare part or on the inside of a part.<br><br>In the end it&#039;s all up to you and how far you want to take things. I too once started with nail clippers and slowly purchased nicer tools and new techniques as I got more into model kits and started buying expensive kits. But if I had to recommend one item if you intend on building more kits, it would definitely be the nippers.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mine arrived but i&#039;m waiting for the weekend so i can do it in peace, once again...</span><br>Enjoy your build anon!", "time": 1674689106, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91123414, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "chink shit", "time": 1674694490, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91123596, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:08:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91092189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91092189</a><br>I\u2019ve had these pedals for a few months and they seem to be holding up alright. <br>https://a.aliexpress.com/_mswoNRu", "filename": "9F22C73D-DB3D-420B-BD41-769203CC7DEA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674695323466058, "time": 1674695323, "md5": "ocZxITnKZQbbkoq7MsfQZg==", "fsize": 265979, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91124203, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)20:51:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91123414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91123414</a><br>General", "time": 1674697906, "resto": 91088324}, {"no": 91124641, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)21:19:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91121863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91121863</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For me neither has warranty</span><br>Even on Amazon?<br>I find Amazon chink sellers are way more willing to help when shit goes wrong.

One of the most concerning health risks associated with Chinese plastic is the potential for cancer.<br><br>Chinese plastic products are known to contain high levels of dangerous chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer. BPA, for example, is a chemical commonly found in plastic products, including food containers and water bottles, and has been linked to an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. Similarly, phthalates, which are often added to plastic products to increase their flexibility, have been linked to an increased risk of testicular cancer.<br><br>In addition to the cancer risks, Chinese plastic products are also known to contain heavy metals and other toxic substances that can harm the human body. These toxins can leach into food and drink, leading to serious health issues such as neurological damage and reproductive issues.<br><br>It is therefore highly recommended to avoid Chinese-made plastic products as much as possible, especially when it comes to items that come into direct contact with food and drink.

S\u00f6ystemd is basically the unremovable default in all current Linux distros, which forces us into more obscure territory like Gentoo, Slackware, Guix ect, the trannies destroyed the Linux kernel itself via rust (I know it&#039;s only drivers and not _the kernel_ at the moment, but it&#039;s just a matter of time with Torvalds accepting it), and even stable distros like Slackware and Devuan will have to update sometime. So unless we&#039;ll get a -rust flag in Gentoo (which will become useless the moment some critical feature in the kernel gets [re]written in rust), we&#039;ll have to move to BSDs.

VAX/VMS and WinNT instead have the Balance Set Manager which works on a per-task basis. It monitors processes to keep a sensible limit on how many pages they can have in-memory at once, adapting so that programs which need a lot of memory can get it, but always making sure it&#039;s not at the expense of other programs. And when a process tries to break its fair limits, it can only get a new page by paging out another. Since this is done per-process, you don&#039;t need to stop the whole system to do it, and processes all get a fair share. That&#039;s why you can still use Windows when it&#039;s having to page a lot, meanwhile Linux grinds to a halt.
