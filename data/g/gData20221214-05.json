I&#039;m trying to find Spanish language audio movies and TV shows, as in stuff that was originally in Spanish as opposed to dubs, with Spanish subtitles. It doesn&#039;t matter if they are SHD subs or just regular. I&#039;m an English speaker who is far enough along in learning Spanish that I can watch stuff with Spanish audio and Spanish subs to read along; not advanced enough to just listen to the audio alone and probably won&#039;t be for years.<br><br>A lot of the movies on PTP or shows on BTN that are from Spanish speaking countries tend to not have the Spanish subs. I&#039;m not sure if they were ripped or never available in the first place. A lot of the discs I rent from Netflix to rip have the Spanish subs present, but many don&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping that Spanish trackers might have people ripping them from releases in Spanish speaking countries, which would be more likely to have Spanish subs. Finding them on external subtitle sites is very hit or miss, as is the quality of the translations.<br><br>I know as hard as HD Spain is to get into I&#039;d have to be mayor of Madrid for at least a few years before I got an invite, but does anyone have any other leads? I recently joined Lat-Team and it&#039;s lacking in the content area. I&#039;m down to contribute to build it up, but of the few times it has what I&#039;m looking for, Spanish subs aren&#039;t present.

That&#039;s how I caught my father too because he didn&#039;t realize IDM had a download history. He downloaded some nasty shit, which put me in a predicament.

They work just as well as any other one, which means they work great. <br>4. Folding fork, spoon and two screw on chopsticks - paid $3.66<br>These are amazing.

You can&#039;t have the computer acting as your VPN in-point be, idk, some program running on your current Windows laptop or whatever. That is incredibly retard. You need it to run on more-or-less safe hardware running a secure OS like BSD. I recommend this new chink shit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rl<wbr>J_80d01U<br><br>It has two 2.5Gb ethernet ports and 1 1GB port, so it works well as a home gateway even for people on fiber. Based on the 3588S which is pretty much the perfect SoC for this job. Uses something silly like 5-7W. But personally I would install something like pfSense (FreeBSD) or OpenWRT (Linux) on it as those OSs have kernels designed for being routers, and it&#039;s a good open source starting point. Here&#039;s a video about real world wireguard throughput on that SoC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMb<wbr>Tibi3n2k<br><br>Something like this, and ideally a second obscure device like a PowerPC or an old x86 pre-ME chip, but somehow magically has pcie 2.1 x4 at least so you can install a good network card, can be used to route and do VPN encapsulation too.

What /24 means is that the first 24 bits of the 32 bit address are referencing the network name. See the bottom of the picture. All the bits in the first 3 octets are &quot;on&quot; for network so each octet adds up to 255, hence 255.255.255.0.

The subnet mask for ANY /25 subnet is 255.255.255.128 because we stole the first bit of the last octet, the last octet is now 10000000 in binary which equals 128 in decimal form.<br><br><br>The most important thing is don&#039;t use actual subnets unless you really have to lol", "filename": "subnet", "ext": ".png", "w": 351, "h": 405, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670975065375360, "time": 1670975065, "md5": "7Y49iNFs3XYWkfK8Rt9jjw==", "fsize": 40948, "resto": 90271509}, {"no": 90282039, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)19:02:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90281802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90281802</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no subnet masks are unique to the subnet/network.</span><br>Bad phrasing, they&#039;re not unique, but they just need to be whatever is appropriate for that subnet/network. <br><br>For example in the diagram we did earlier, every network has /24 | 255.255.255.0 because they&#039;re all just class C networks.

The idea is that with a mousepad turned into 2D  graph and a mouse centered at the origin (0,0), one full swipe from X = 0 to X = MAX on the mousepad space will turn your character 180 degrees without lifting the mouse up.

So maybe don&#039;t bother if you can&#039;t install gentoo. It requires a lot of horsepower to run, most run it on google colab (free compute rent) which will opportunistically assign random compute units to you, so performance is all over the place and stability is unpredictable. You can pay $4/hr for runpod if you want reliability, probably, idk never tried either of these.<br>Another thing is Kobold will let you run the model even if you do not have enough VRAM, which cripples it and makes it crash all the time, but lets poorfags run it locally, which of course, invites them to complain about it and misunderstand what&#039;s happening.<br>The way I see it, it works perfectly on linux on my 3090. I get to run Erebus 13B which is pathetically weak compared to CAI, it doesn&#039;t understand human biology, it will write shit like &quot;she looks at her womb&quot; (in context makes it as if her guts are spilling out) and &quot;he takes his stomach and stands up&quot; (as if its a briefcase).

Of course I knew about the melting connector issue, like everyone, so I made sure that it was horizontal and I had a big enough case to not make it much of an issue. I also ordered the Cablemod replacement for the thing but it had a 2 week delay.<br>The problem was that when the thing was put to sleep or turned off, a red light right next to the connector turned on. A red light is a big no in my mind so I start searching and I see that many others have this but they dismiss it as &quot;eh, it just shows that the PC is connected to a power source&quot; or other kind of messages. Very few people actually mentioned something about insufficient energy input.<br>Well, my cablemod replacement arrived 20 minutes ago, installed it, made sure to have a proper distance from the conector to curving the cable, and voil\u00e1, red light gone. Still haven&#039;t tested my PC, gonna try Portal RTX cuz that motherfucker is actually unoptimized to shit and it has the 4090 at 99% usage and that&#039;s without any AA at 1440, gonna check if the cable changes anything in performance.<br>So yeah, my guess is that the adapter either can&#039;t properly send sufficient energy or there&#039;s a weird signal that the standard cables don&#039;t send.<br>Either way, I wouldn&#039;t risk it and if you have or plan on getting a 4xxx series, actual cables without adapters are a must.", "time": 1670982326, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283467, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283423</a><br>what site is this? ebay?", "time": 1670982341, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283470, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:45:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283463</a><br>No need to lie, you obviously lose track of your cursor a lot.", "time": 1670982356, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283477, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:46:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283467</a><br>Yeah its ebay", "time": 1670982393, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283491, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:47:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283391</a><br>see<br><a href=\"#p90283288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283288</a><br>anyone who cares about rt is a faggot. the only cool thing is live AI for older games and that has yet to take off", "time": 1670982459, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283503, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283288</a><br>Insane amd seethe over RT lmao<br>so cherrypicked<br>https://imgsli.com/MTM5NjY1<br>https://imgsli.com/MTM5NjY5<br>https://imgsli.com/MTM5Njcx", "time": 1670982488, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283504, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:48:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283448</a><br>4k gaming is viable this gen", "time": 1670982498, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283505, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:48:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283448</a><br>4k gaming is already very much doable, anon<br>a 3060ti will do 4k/60hz acceptably well (with compromises in settings, and dlss for AAAs)<br>similarly, a 3080 will do 4k high refresh <br>and a 4090 will fucking eat 4k/120hz for breakfast, unless you also want RT and don&#039;t use dlss <br><br>if you&#039;re buying a new monitor right now, its stupid not to get 4k<br>i mean, i get it, the gpu market is still fucked<br>but the main reason it was fucked in the first place, namely cryptoniggers, are no longer a concern<br>nor will they ever be again<br>so i definitely expect the gpu pricing situation to improve significantly<br>i don&#039;t wanna try predicting when this will happen, but happen it will, and certainly within the lifetime of whatever monitor you buy now.", "time": 1670982507, "resto": 90282217}, {"no": 90283530, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)20:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90283503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90283503</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DUDE I CAN SEE THE LINES IN THE WOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do you think AMD will step up their game here at all or just leave their compute shit to languish? I don&#039;t want to wait for a pro-tier R(C?)DNA3 card to come out to wait for support.<br><br>But at the same time I dont have a 4090 or 7900 in hand right now and I&#039;ve been monitoring stock for about a month. For 4090s at least, they disappear almost immediately and I don&#039;t think I have a chance of getting either one for months.
