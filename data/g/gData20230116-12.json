I&#039;d say MPD is well suited to this use-case. It has builtin HTTP streaming capability and can also work with Icecast. The HTTP stream will just put a stream to a TCP port whereas Icecast will give you a minimal web interface and will let you open the stream in shoutcast clients.

Look around for what appeals to you. <br>As for proper things that I got from Ali that actually made my room nicer:<br>- Led strips, preferably Bluetooth or WLAN compatible. It&#039;s a bit basic, but I like the look anyways. Attach to the back or underside of a desk/shelf for indirect light. <br>- &quot;Fairy lights&quot; give a comfy winter feeling. I have one around my desk and a solar one in my plants at the window. Even got one on the balcony.<br>- a led strip with a movement sensor under the bed so you can turn it on/off with your foot. Nice if you want to go to the toilet at night without turning the whole light on to wake up.<br>- comfy blankets and pillows. Pillows for bed/sofa, blanket on a chair.<br>- Your can get some rope hangers for plant pots for a good price if you like hanging plants.<br>- organizers keep clutter out of the way. I particularly like drawers that go in the PCs CD bay<br>- there&#039;s some pretty neat organizers for saving space in the closet for clothes<br>- cable organizers for clutter<br>- If you like the aesthetic there&#039;s sheet metal posters you can put on walls. Pictures are usually not worth it, posters may be if you like them. <br>- other than that it depends on your style. If you like the &quot;hoarding weeb&quot; aesthetic, get shelves to display figurines. If you want it more feminine, a lot of whites, pelts, lights (fairly lights are good), and wall art with fake motivational texts. Personally I quite like the &quot;french country home&quot; aesthetic for my kitchen (a lot of wood, metal and rustic things, generally a very open kitchen instead of clean cabinets) and a more industrial sleeping room.

Obviously you&#039;re sol if you want to use the normal stack(though it MAY be possible to do some wizardry, I&#039;m not hopeful for a magical open source html rendering engine anytime soon), so instead you use something else, probably sexps, maybe byte compile and compressed. Now you&#039;ve basically reinvented HTML+CSS+JS. Did you do a better job? Maybe.

For example, cold weather, it will feel ice cold when you first put em in. Also, physical properties potentially lead to more moisture ingress and condensation. <br>If you check out SeeAudio&#039;s Facebook page, they send out a letter regarding Yume II unit failures. They do address it directly and extend their warranty &amp; replacement services, which is actually a good sign about the character of their company. Side anecdote: I do have a SeeAudio product (Bravery Anniversary Edition) and when I communicated via Aliexpress with Angelears Audio Store, they were very prompt in communication (not regarding any kind of replacement need, but for an extra promo discount I won, and did receive promptly).<br>In all, nothing of major concern in my opinion considering the world of ChiFi. Many worse ways and worse companies to get screwed by.

No other game I&#039;ve played had a 17 year old bishonen guy drink a 14 year old girl&#039;s piss and chase her down the hall to rape her, only to wind up getting anally raped by a 32 year old fat man. I still remember the scene where a 16-17 girl was hiding under a bed as her same age best friend was having sex with that same 32 year old fat guy on top. She heard every moan, bed shake and sound. In the wrong end she was discovered under the bed by her friend and made to join. A most terrifying scene was when an unwilling girl relives another girl&#039;s sex memories. The girl in the memory consented but the reliving girl didn&#039;t. It didn&#039;t matter that she was mentally screaming, her body in the memory did all the motions and actions as in history. It&#039;s like mind control rape except the victim was fully aware. Another scene the same girl and a friend were almost raped in a magic sex ritual, saved by the girl&#039;s older sister, and the backlash made the older sister want to rape her younger sister and friend.<br><br>The loli in this pic is freakishly lewd and once disguised herself as a teenage girl, fucked a boy until he nearly came, transformed back saying<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You thought you were having sex with a highschooler weren&#039;t you? I&#039;m an elementary schooler all along!</span><br>And leglocks that boy, forcing him to cum inside her unprotected, when he screams in fear upon learning this. This isn&#039;t even getting into the tentacles, the gay sex, the lesbian sex, the incest, the sequel&#039;s mother/daughter lesbian scene, etc. The first chapter alone contains lots of lesbian sex scenes with an unavoidable girl masturbating in the bathroom.

Planar magnetic tend to have lower distortion so they&#039;re a bit better when it comes to open-backs that will be EQed to fix roll-off or add a bass shelf, they look cool too. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; what are their most neutral consumer implementations?</span><br>If you mean neutral sound, the term as lost most of its meaning. The HD 800s for example has a flat bass response and is fairly bright, to me that isn&#039;t neutral and true neutrality is what represents music as it sounds in real life which to my ears would be more bass, more energy in the 1-4 kHz range, and slightly less treble, that would create a frequency response similar to what has validated by preference research over the last decade, referred to as the Harman target. More into the weeds but there there is also the question of if you should even want a neutral sound because a lot of music is flat and lacking detail. An aggressive V-shape done right in my view is unrated and very good for movies and games since the stimulus isn&#039;t as constant and listener fatigue is less of a factor. <br><br>Not sure if any of this answers your question but there&#039;s no hard-and-fast rule that equates to buy X headphones if you like classical and opera music.", "time": 1673865892, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926300, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:09:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "THREADLY REMINDER<br>flat /= neutral", "time": 1673870949, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926381, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90926300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90926300</a><br>Flat is injustice", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673871454348430, "time": 1673871454, "md5": "I1+71n+lVU0sU5N1rpw50g==", "fsize": 164671, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926398, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:18:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90926300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90926300</a><br>Flat = gross<br>Neutral = good?", "time": 1673871538, "resto": 90916242}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 90922580, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:46:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s your codeforces.com rating?", "filename": "Korotkevich_ITMO", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1088, "h": 1632, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673848002841014, "time": 1673848002, "md5": "e4Ir/uucOGFwnhMpv/HIEA==", "fsize": 155602, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-your-codeforcescom-rating", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 90922606, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:48:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90922580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90922580</a><br>nobody here codes, let alone competitively", "time": 1673848121, "resto": 90922580}, {"no": 90922617, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:49:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t use it so I don&#039;t know what a good rating looks like, I&#039;ll go with 8426 and hope that means I&#039;m good at it.", "time": 1673848181, "resto": 90922580}, {"no": 90922645, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:52:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90922617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90922617</a><br>It&#039;s like elo in chess and nobody has achieved &gt;4000.

They agreed to break the law at the time by signing a secret agreement to divide the land, a local People&#039;s Commune, into family plots. Each plot was to be worked by an individual family who would turn over some of what they grew to the government and the collective whilst at the same time agreeing that they could keep the surplus for themselves. The villagers also agreed that should one of them be caught and sentenced to death that the other villagers would raise their children until they were eighteen years old.[5][6] At the time, the villagers were worried that another famine might strike the village after a particularly bad harvest and more people might die of hunger.[6]</span><br><br>    &gt;After this secret capitalist reform, Xiaogang village produced a harvest that was larger than the previous five years combined.[5] Per capita income in the village increase from 22 yuan to 400 yuan with grain output increasing to 90,000 kg in 1979.[6] This attracted significant attention from surrounding villages and before long the government in Beijing had found out. The villagers were fortunate in that at the time China had just changed leadership after Mao Zedong had died. The new leadership under Deng Xiaoping was looking for ways to reform China&#039;s economy and the discovery of Xiaogang&#039;s innovation was held up as a model to other villages across the country. This led to the abandonment of collectivised farming across China and a large increase in agricultural production.

The first stage, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the de-collectivization of agriculture, the opening up of the country to foreign investment, and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses. However, a large percentage of industries remained state-owned. The second stage of reform, in the late 1980s and 1990s, involved the privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry. The 1985 lifting of price controls[7] was a major reform, and protectionist policies and regulations soon followed, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). The private sector grew remarkably, accounting for as much as 70 percent of China&#039;s gross domestic product by 2005.[8] From 1978 until 2013, unprecedented growth occurred, with the economy increasing by 9.5% a year.<br><br>    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_econo<wbr>mic_reform", "filename": "chinese economic reforms", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1993, "h": 2733, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673767791709093, "time": 1673767791, "md5": "zQrHiaeBrl+DNDLjVwRT8A==", "fsize": 680856, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905339, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905320</a><br><a href=\"#p90905334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905334</a><br>not reading", "time": 1673767820, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905365, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:34:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905320</a><br>I also watched that Lex Friedman interview", "time": 1673768081, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905371, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905339</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not reading</span><br>didn&#039;t ask", "filename": "", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 250, "h": 250, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673768096570020, "time": 1673768096, "md5": "iFgTrCwUBg+1edBl1UaLIw==", "fsize": 6722, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905389, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90902063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90902063</a><br>thats a poo, not paki", "time": 1673768184, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905481, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90901854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90901854</a><br>capital accumulation", "time": 1673768918, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905534, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90901906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90901906</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;maths</span>", "time": 1673769401, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905650, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Shareholders wanted more money.

Kurumi MaidCard is my first real tool of organization and it doesn&#039;t have any version control features yet. I left a lot of space in the Meta Data Maid Address (bottom right corner) for something to handle version control later. If a tool ends up being inadequate or needs different powers I will add them and put it on the /sci/ence board or the dra/g/on maid board.<br><br><a href=\"#p90922093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90922093</a><br><a href=\"#p90922557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90922557</a><br>In Kurumi MaidCard, no effort is made to hide the data, because I want people to know the Maid Card has data so they can open it. It&#039;s just drawn on top of the Maid Stick (decorative part of the image).<br><br>Originally there was no compression with it and every character got it&#039;s own 4 by 8 Maid Symbol, but that resulted in File Data Maid Addresses which were too big to be useful. Either exceeding the posting limit or just looking like TV static with no clue what it was supposed to be. So I added Maid-LZW compression so my File Data Maid Address can take less space on the image. Maid-LZW is like LZW except instead of mapping strings and integers together, I used string and Maid Symbols. If you want to read about it more you can see the code inside Kurumi MaidCard and the README has information too.<br><br>My goal was to be able to put my code in a 4Chan post so that I don&#039;t have to make a dependence on GitHub for distribution. For that to work the Maid Stickers are important because they sort of work like thumbnails and make the code more recognizable at a glance. I am going to fully deprecate GitHub for everyone but corporate users.

A tiling WM doesn&#039;t replace anything by default. It&#039;s a standalone window manager.

I read the privacy policies on each site and it seems some will permanently delete your data (they claim), which is good. It also seems some will remove it from their index but still retain it so they don&#039;t create a new person if some new record in the future that relates to you is obtained. Which seems reasonable as long as they aren&#039;t sharing the data with third parties. For example, White Pages is a good example of this. Overall, I think it&#039;s a good idea to go through all of the major data brokers and remove anything you can find regardless of what they do. At the very least it gets your shit off Google and other search engines as about half of those I exampled publicly dispaly everything about you on the surface web (ie Radaris, Instant Checkmate, White Pages, Spokeo, Voter Records, TruePeopleSearch, etc...). I think the biggest thing that&#039;s helped recently is CCPA as many of those businesses are scared of being sued and there&#039;s been increased awareness about them since the John Oliver segment last year.", "time": 1673846370, "resto": 90917831}, {"no": 90922530, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)00:41:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I blocked all ports except 443 and 80 and will not open any other ports whatsoever until I move to another house. <br>Is there any way anyone can pawn me now?", "time": 1673847702, "resto": 90917831}, {"no": 90923867, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90917831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90917831</a><br>How\u2019s free speech there?

The biggest is underestimating how much time you need to finish a decent game, much less an engine. You were probably thinking of making one at some point, right? Well take that estimate and multiply it by 50. Yes, no exaggeration, it&#039;s simply that big of a project. And estimating the complexity of an engine is 10 times worse. Factor in limited motivation and you&#039;re really only left with 2 realistic choices: never making a game ever or using all the shortcuts you can. Yes, you&#039;re probably imagining how easy it is to write a 20 liner to render an image or a 40 liner for displaying a 3d model in opengl and thinking &quot;durrr it can&#039;t be THAT bad&quot;. But it is. It&#039;s hard to explain. You don&#039;t think it be like that but it do. Another reason is underestimating how fast modern hardware is. On one hand, you probably share the notion that modern software is too bloated and can be done better. But you&#039;re again forced to make a choice here: spending years learning to optimize your shit and probably lose interest in the whole thing thus, again, never making anything, or making SOMETHING that actually works at full speed on 95% machines anyway, within a reasonable time frame. One more is underestimating how flexible modern game engines are. You can really do any game you want in them. You just need to learn if you can&#039;t see that.<br>Basically, it&#039;s an issue of making actually realistic choices that have actually good odds of coming true. Obviously, in a perfect world, you would make everything from scratch, and your ebin multiplayer open world harvest moon/pokemon roguelike with voxel graphics and procedural everything would run on a toaster and you&#039;d be crowned king of videogames.

The X220 has a 16:9, so I&#039;d imagine it would be super thin.<br>Also the X series is really expensive. The X220 is 100$ at the cheapest if you get lucky and even then you&#039;re going to be missing parts. There&#039;s plenty that go for 150-300.<br>Meanwhile, you can get the T420 under 100$ easily. You could even look into other options around the same price like the T420i which has a slightly less powerful CPU, T420p (performance) has a slighty more powerful cpu and T420s(slim).

It&#039;s perhaps a bit fat but it&#039;s well made and thought of. I have had it carry three laptops but usually with me is my work macbook pro, a lot of cables for different things, a gozero sherpa powerbank with 60W of type c power output, a mouse and whatever shit I might need. It can expand by opening up a zipper that compresses it so I can put in a jacket if I need to but I try to keep it just for the computer and accessories, everything I need and might need. it has backpack straps too that hide in the back. Useful if it turns out I have to carry it for a longer time.<br><br>The 2 day assault is my daily driver backpack when I&#039;m bringing my personal PC and camera with me. It&#039;s very EDC focused so it has a good padded laptop pocket with easy access and a lot of other storage options. I wish it had a larger capacity but for what it is, and for the price, it&#039;s a winner. It hardly shows any signs of wear even though I&#039;ve used it a lot.<br><br>The largest is the Komodo Dragon and it&#039;s great for when I&#039;m travelling. It&#039;s more mil gear so it doesn&#039;t have a laptop pocket but I don&#039;t tend to use this backpack when I travel with a laptop. It can carry it, but this is more like a do-it-all for hiking and stuff. I like to use this when riding with my motorcycle as I often need the capacity. As for quality compared to the 2 day assault, there is not much difference. It&#039;s stronger and bigger but how well the 2 day performs, it&#039;s hard to justify buying this.
