It&#039;s like a never-ending game of whack-a-mole!<br><br>&quot;But you know what the worst part is? When you mess up your dotfiles, and everything goes haywire! I mean, have you ever tried to use the terminal without a .bashrc file?

First it&#039;s one of the easier things a newfag can get into. It produces mostly instant results that work everywhere. The problem is they are slow and chew through resources. 20 years ago no such thing would have been allowed. End users would have have accepted it in a age where they had at best 1Ghz single core CPU, 512MB of RAM and an aDSL connection. aDSL was &quot;slow&quot; by today&#039;s standards but the web itself was blazing fast. The simple HTML pages loaded faster than you could click on them. The only thing that really made them feel slow was the use of a lot of tables in the HTML. But only because the browsers back then rendered them slowly. Still faster than modern javashit.<br><br>There is only a demand for these webshitters because the industry artificially creates it. End users have accepted these shitty slow websites and no one strives to produce anything better. Google could change the web tomorrow by introducing a proper dynamic version of HTML. But they&#039;ll never do it. Because they make more money producing shit and selling the collected data back to the Government. They WANT javascript to be this massive exploitable surface. It gives them free access into every machine that visits their webpages. It gives them the ability to run exploits on the end user&#039;s machine.<br><br>No one liked javascript until methods like AJAX were possible. It was understood that this was a hack soon to be replaced by something like XUL. But it never happened. They just kept piling shit on top of shit. Eventually XUL gets ripped out of the mozilla source code and no one cared. After years of attempting to standardize around things like XHMTL.<br><br>The industry doesn&#039;t want to train programmers.
