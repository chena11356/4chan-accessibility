Already in early 1837, Heinrich Marx, castigating his son Karl&#039;s wanton spending of the money of others, wrote to him that &quot;on one point \u2026 you have wisely found fit to observe an aristocratic silence; I am referring to the paltry matter of money.&quot; Indeed, Marx took money from any source available: his father, mother, and throughout his adult life, his long-suffering friend and abject disciple, Friedrich Engels, all of whom fueled Marx&#039;s capacity for spending money like water.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An insatiable spender of other people&#039;s money, Marx continually complained about a shortage of financial means. While sponging on Engels, Marx perpetually complained to his friend that his largess was never enough. Thus, in 1868, Marx insisted that he could not make do on an annual income of less than \u00a3400-\u00a3500, a phenomenal sum considering that the upper tenth of Englishmen in that period were earning an average income of only \u00a372 a year. Indeed, so profligate was Marx that he quickly ran through an inheritance from a German follower of \u00a3824 in 1864, as well as a gift of \u00a3350 from Engels in the same year.</span><br><br>You can see why losers take after him and his ideology.", "time": 1672659574, "resto": 90653331}, {"no": 90657496, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90655855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90655855</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;while the millions of mindless subhumans vote against them</span><br>2 problems here first<br>representative democracy is a joke  direct democracy is only democracy.

Great speed, clarity, separation and layering. Fast transients make the bass appear light, but it&#039;s clean. Treble has excellent tonality, but it is a vocal forward tune that borders being bright. Solid soundstage, not supernatural. <br>Hexa is an $80 hybrid. When you own other best in class $200-$400 hybrids, you understand exactly why Truthear priced it at $80, because it sounds like it. They probably used shitty Bellsing BAs for the treble which result in meh tonality. Only 3 BAs so nothing great in layering and separation, passable. The DD is probably an old generation LCP because it&#039;s slow and not remarkable in any way. So... $80 for a bunch of below average? Not rec&#039;able in any way other than if you desire to hear Blessing2 (original) style tune, because the way the sub bass through mids is relatively flat and not a scooped transition is unique. It&#039;s also mostly black color so it looks more professional than most ChiFi. Oh and to reiterate, imaging and soundstage for Hexa is downright POOR.

At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. </span><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_<wbr>celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg<wbr><br>Cont:", "filename": "Himmelserscheinung_\u00fcber_N\u00fcrnberg_vom_14._April_1561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 900, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672646051175762, "time": 1672646051, "md5": "E0GC9TVYHfVn4FBzbTGSWg==", "fsize": 365205, "resto": 90653076}, {"no": 90654764, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)02:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90654393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90654393</a><br>So uhh... you do know that the Cold War was well underway by 1952, right?

Software error causes linked sensors to track these reflections as they are picked up by FLIR. Then when they move out of the range of motion of the tracking mirror they appear to dart to some direction at incredible speed. Most people have never operated a thermal imaging device, especially not a military grade one and the images they produce can look pretty weird for untrained eye. Infrared light behaves differently than visible light under certain conditions, for example you may be able to see through certain objects if there is a hot item on the other side that radiates heat on the object blocking the view. On the other hand, glass reflects infrared light extremely well and it&#039;s difficult to see through, you will only see a reflection. I know the thermal sight on a tank and FLIR on a fighter plane are not the same thing, but many of the same principles apply. For example you can reproduce the same darting to the side effect by traveling on a twisting road and having the turret locked forwards. The sight will then be free to move around in a limited range of motion.<br><br>As for visual identification by pilots, maybe they really saw them and maybe they didn&#039;t, doesn&#039;t really matter. Eyewitness testimonies are unreliable at best and people can think they see something that really isn&#039;t there especially under stressful conditions like long combat missions. And especially if they&#039;re looking for something that their sensors picked up and they are trained to rely on their sensors. At any rate identifying a fast moving uap at long range would be physically very difficult anyway, that&#039;s why jet fighters are equipped with sensors for fighting beyond visual range.<br><br>As

What you can do is this:<br><br>Buy a Pixel 7 without your name attached, open that fucker up, remove any sensor tech (cam, mic, accelerometer, gyro, finger print sensor, loud speaker, etc.) and the long band antenna (for GSM). That way you will only have the short band antenna for WiFi/BT in there. You could also remove that and get a USB C/micro USB antenna dongle or something.

You&#039;ll be able to phone 911 without a SIM though, so you still can connect. Without the antenna however your device is deaf and mute. Use only WiFi then and faraday bag your device when moving. You won&#039;t be able to receive calls, SMS or any &quot;phone&quot; stuff. You&#039;ll just have a portable WiFi pocket computer with a touch screen and no other functionality.

People have all these things in their phones so they can use apps and social media. The apps and social media platforms only exist to harvest user data, the smartphone is the interface for that. The smartphone is smart so it can learn as much about its owner as possible. That the owner gets a &quot;use&quot; out of the device is absolutely secondary and a sick joke at best. The owner does not own or control the device, the options in Google and Apple phones have been shown to be completely useless.<br><br>And now you want to reform this device into some security and privacy (non-botnet) thing? I mean, I just described what I think is the best way to go in that direction, but you do notice the problem here, right? These devices were never made for privacy, in fact a whole lot of tech never was: any kind of telegraphy (long distance signalling) like phones or internet, SMS, email, none of these were made with security OR privacy in mind. Those features were painted on later on and mostly don&#039;t really work.<br><br>The modern info tech we use was developed by some nerdy computer scientists in universities who used their expensive as fuck gadgets to send funny messages around and play pen and paper RPGs over the network.

But never did any company or government lock itself out from spying on all its subjects. They only try to prevent OTHERS from doing the worst shit.<br><br>So the idea of electronically transmitting information long distance itself is heavily flawed when you think security and privacy.

I use the analysis board a lot. I would often leave the analysis board open at some position I was studying. I would often leave a lichess tab open at some position I wanted to come back to later, but every time I would come back to it after more than an hour or so, it would force a refresh the instant the page became active again. This refresh would cause me to lose the position I was in. I decided to start using the Lichess &quot;study&quot; feature. This was a little better, because at least I could have the line still saved, but it would still force a refresh and cause me to lose the specific place in the study that I was in.  So I thought maybe I would try my hand at fixing this issue. After all, I am a software developer. Why shouldn&#039;t I? But first, I decided to pop in to their discord and see if I could talk to the existing devs about it. I tried asking if such a change would be accepted or if I would be wasting my time to develop a fix. They told me everything from &quot;it&#039;s intended behavior&quot; to &quot;it&#039;s a bug with your environment&quot;. You notice how those are 2 very conflicting responses? Anyways, they were complete asshats to me because they couldn&#039;t handle the possibility of there being anything wrong with their precious project, even though I was offering to spend my time fixing it for free. Eventually when they realized how retarded they were being about it, they decided to end the argument by telling me that it wasn&#039;t designed to be used the way I wanted to use it and so I should use something else. So I did. I use chess.com now. Their analysis board doesn&#039;t have this problem.<br><br>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

No idea why chinks do that.<br>Got myself this laptop, extra RAM stick, HDD and hopefully less trashy SSD and I&#039;m loving it so far (picture is taken straight out of the box before upgrades).<br>Bought it specifically because it has a proper CPU and is fully upgradeable.<br>Overall build quality is adequate, no issues with keyboard or touchpad, everything works smoothly. Webcam is kind of trash. Speakers are trash.

It just needs some effort put into it and with the vanishing of RegularOP it managed to sustain itself a little, but deteriorated over time. Threads would be irregular, always use the same pictures, never had news and the OP text got progressively more outdated.<br>I eventually decided to put some effort in, at least by making a proper OP picture with the previous thread&#039;s posts as well as writing actual news again. The thread started regaining vitality pretty quickly after that thanks to various anons reviewing purchases and posting OC (big thanks to them at this point). Since then we have even managed to update the guide (the static site isn&#039;t done yet, but the new guide is a lot more in-depth and better than the old one).<br>That line that triggers your filter is actually boilertext from before I took over the thread. I see little reason to change it since it&#039;s accurate but personally I am not in any way married to that sentence. That being said, if your filter rules are shit and catch other threads you want, that&#039;s primarily a you problem and expecting the threads to adjust their writing rather than changing your filters to reflect the (never changing) op texts is pretty foolish. Or just whitelist the threads. The word &quot;China&quot; will appear sometimes in the news anyways, so it wouldn&#039;t even fix your issue. <br>I have a regex rule that filters mass replying people, which used to get triggered by the news. Obviously it&#039;d be strange to expect the OP to change the formatting of the news and instead I adjusted the filter rules to no longer filter /csg/.<br>/csg/ is one of the most comfy threads on /g/ so I am happy seing it back and you are welcome to rejoin us anon. The more the merrier.

They are very finicky and it doesn&#039;t take much to mess them up. The more devices I own with lithium-ion batteries, the more of a chore it becomes to take care of all those batteries.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br><br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.

I had 2 hours to make the program work and figured it would take me 20 years to do it given how complicated the computer in front of me was. I was really freaking out trying to figure out the correct binary electrical pulses that would flip the right bits to feedback to change the pixels on the screen, there were so many steps and at such speed I felt sick just trying to picture it all. Needless to say I failed miserably with the professor asking what kind of &quot;Hell Spawned Assembly Language!?!&quot; I was writing in a class based on Visual Basic, only to have him run my code and have part of the graphics card fry. I figured that would happen given it was not complete, but I was a little proud given I had at least got the the signal to the graphical part of the computer without even opening it up. I was then banned from the computer lab computers after that given my code had physically damaged a computers and told to bring my own hardware to complete the assignments if I wanted to get a passing grad. I did mange to technically pass the class by making some mods and code to completing most of the assignments on an Amiga my Dad taught me how to use as a kid, but I suspect part of it was they just wanted me gone and the class was only a required elective for my Business Management degree and we both knew we wouldn&#039;t see each other again.

Here&#039;s ChatGPT&#039;s take:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are high expectations placed on both virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, but there are also some key differences in the way these technologies are perceived and the expectations that are placed on them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One key difference is that VR is often seen as a more specialized or niche technology, while AI is seen as having more widespread potential applications. VR is often associated with gaming and entertainment, while AI is seen as having the potential to transform a wide range of industries and sectors, including healthcare, transportation, finance, and more.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another difference is that VR is often seen as more of a consumer technology, while AI is seen as having more potential for business and enterprise applications. VR is often marketed to individual users, while AI is often developed and deployed by organizations to improve efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite the high expectations placed on both VR and AI, AI is likely to be more than just overhyped for a number of reasons. For one thing, AI has already demonstrated its value in a number of practical applications, and there is a growing body of evidence to support its potential to solve real-world problems and drive economic growth. In contrast, VR has had a slower adoption rate and has faced challenges in finding compelling, mainstream use cases. Additionally, the field of AI is advancing rapidly, with significant investment and research. This suggests that AI is likely to continue to make progress and deliver on its promise in the coming years, while VR may struggle to live up to some of the hype surrounding it.</span>", "time": 1672580875, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90638811, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)08:50:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90638771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90638771</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;VR has nowhere near the same capability to augment or even replace human intellectual labor.</span><br><br>I never suggested it does.

In this paper, we will consider a focused definition of emergent abilities of large language models: An ability is emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Emergent abilities would not have been directly predicted by extrapolating a scaling law (i.e. consistent performance improvements) from small-scale models. When visualized via a scaling curve (x-axis: model scale, y-axis: performance), emergent abilities show a clear pattern\u2014performance is near-random until a certain critical threshold of scale is reached, after which performance increases to substantially above random. This qualitative change is also known as a phase transition\u2014a dramatic change in overall behavior that would not have been foreseen by examining smaller-scale systems (Huberman &amp; Hogg, 1987)</span><br><br>Huberman &amp; Hogg, 1987<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We predict that large-scale artificial intelligence systems and cognitive models will undergo sudden phase transitions from disjointed parts into coherent structures as their topological connectivity increases beyond a critical value. These situations, ranging from production systems to semantic net computations, are characterized by event horizons in space-time that determine the range of causal connections between processes. At transition, these event horizons undergo explosive changes in size. This phenomenon, analogous to phase transitions in nature, provides a new paradigm with which to analyze the behavior of large-scale computation and determine its generic features.</span><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quant<wbr>um_phase_transition<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase<wbr>_transition", "filename": "c12", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 954, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1672618597875102, "time": 1672618597, "md5": "SJZMOr+Z6cQrzHzY79A64Q==", "fsize": 53086, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90648825, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)19:23:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90644363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90644363</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The paper you provided discusses the concept of emergence in the context of large language models. Specifically, the authors define emergence as an ability that is present in large models but not in smaller models, and that is not predicted by extrapolating a scaling law from small-scale models. The authors argue that emergent abilities can be visualized as a phase transition in a scaling curve, where performance is near-random until a critical threshold of scale is reached, after which performance increases significantly. The authors also reference a 1987 paper by Huberman and Hogg, which discusses the idea that large-scale artificial intelligence systems and cognitive models may undergo phase transitions as their topological connectivity increases beyond a certain critical value. These phase transitions are characterized by event horizons that determine the range of causal connections between processes, and can lead to dramatic changes in the behavior of the system.</span><br>FYI I put my own post into GPT3 and GPT3 seems to have a better &quot;understanding&quot; of what&#039;s going on here better than the human posters on /g/ posting about AI", "filename": "confusedanimegirl", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 735, "h": 703, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1672618994056536, "time": 1672618994, "md5": "J4KCV+Kq+SorYOICn+knMQ==", "fsize": 61472, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651076, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:58:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90637239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90637239</a><br>Idk", "time": 1672628314, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651138, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:02:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90639938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90639938</a><br>there are 7 people that can each turn off the internet", "time": 1672628552, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651189, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:06:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90648825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90648825</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The authors also reference a 1987 paper by Huberman and Hogg,</span><br>AI has knowledge of books, which existence  most of /g/  didn&#039;t know of.", "time": 1672628789, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651314, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:17:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90637180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90637180</a><br>why are you cooming about parameters, better algorithm beats it in less and will run in potato.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; just grow up</span>", "time": 1672629434, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651424, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:25:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "GPT will just put all middle managers and low-level white-collar workers who smugly considered themselves immune to technological unemployment out of a job", "time": 1672629939, "resto": 90637180}, {"no": 90651458, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)22:28:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90651424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90651424</a><br>The only reason it hasn&#039;t happened is because the people responsible for replacing them will also be replaced, and most people still have no idea that ChatGPT exists.

There are a lot of idiots out there who think adhering to &quot;true Unix&quot; tradition means a bunch of shitty ncurses interfaces, but suckless is one of the few groups that really understands the appeal of Unix tools, because they&#039;re not shitty ncurses interfaces, and they&#039;re not even shitty, interactive CLI interfaces; Unix tools are one-dimensional. They&#039;re singular in there application, with no superlatives or quality-of-life features, and a pleasant side-affect of that is that they&#039;re light and pipe-able. Emacs works best as a frontend for software like that. Surf is somewhat neutered, so it depends on dmenu to sort of carry things from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;, something that what otherwise be poorly-implemented by the browser itself, like issuing search search queries and searching for arbitrary text, but the funny thing is, Emacs does precisely that, except better. I can interact with Surf via Emacs in precisely the same way dmenu is used to interact with Surf, and that simply wouldn&#039;t be possible if it weren&#039;t for suckless&#039; paradoxically humble elitism. Emacs loves simple applications, because it&#039;s easy to take something intentionally shallow and effectively create your own toolkit with Elisp.

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

The 5700G is quite a nice APU with basically the same performance as the 3700x; it should probably be the centrepiece of any ultra-sff build. Nevertheless, the 5600G could be had for $120 making it a total steal.<br>As for the motherboard, I would recommend that you get a B550 one, and stay far away from x570. Today the prices seem to be a bit wacky, but the Gigabyte B550I should be had for $150. The ASrock equivalent should fetch the same price, and has a PS2 port if you are into that - it has marginally worse modern I/O. The ASUS B550 has a bios-flashback button, not to mention that its bios is more tailored for performance tuning. Obviously, any motherboard, even B450, will be more expensive than the 5600G - I don&#039;t think such a price ratio is ideal. Speaking of B450, most of them have been long sold out, and the prices are a hair lower than B550; nevertheless, you wouldn&#039;t be missing many features though as the ryzen 5000 APUs do not support PCIe 4.0. The main issue is that you would need an older ryzen CPU on hand to update the B450 bios to support the more recent APUs.<br>As for the cooler, go with Noctua L9a - it&#039;s that simple.<br>For memory, you should not go lower than 3200 cl 16; the Vulcan Z is one of the better budget RAM that has easy and ample overclocking headroom - I still would be wary of TeamGroup switching the memory die that they are using to something inferior because of the diminished DDR4 production capacity.<br>As of today, the best $/Gb NVME SSD with TLC Nand, and a DRAM cache is the 1 TB Sabrent Rocket 4.0; lamentably, the 5700G will not benefit from the increased PCIe 4.0 speeds, but it should still be plenty fast. Conversely, if you just need a lot of cheap SSD storage, I recommend that you go with the 2 TB Crucial P3 Plus.", "filename": "parts", "ext": ".png", "w": 1433, "h": 901, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1672643322604352, "time": 1672643322, "md5": "dabpfoWSbw7tGb6P2MHbRA==", "fsize": 155500, "resto": 90645813}, {"no": 90654207, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)02:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90654154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90654154</a><br>The In Win B1 would be my case of choice because of its accessibility with regards to diminutive size, price, availability, ease of build, and the included PSU; $80 is a stellar price. There is also the B1 mesh which would have better cooling, and the B1 pure which has even more aesthetically pleasing looks thanks to them replacing the tempered glass with a wood panel. Obviously, the two other variants are more expensive.<br>If you are into even smaller cases, I would have to recommend looking into Custom Mod; their SL1 is probably the tiniest consumer sff case available; the PSU is sold separately, but the case itself is close to half of the price of the B1 so the total price would be close to a B1 mesh.<br>Likewise, if you want an attractive case, you could look into the Densium APU or the Cubeor Aski; both are good looking wood cases.<br>With a $660 BoM cost (if you buy the motherboard at the inflated $200 asking price, and get yourself a single Sabrent Rocket stick) you would have enough money to splurge on more exotic cases; alternatively, you could dedicate it towards getting more RAM and/or storage.
