I just spent all day messing with my ram trying to get it to its &quot;rated&quot; speed, but I ended up failing to achieve a stable system so I gave up. My question is, why write an overclocked speed on the ram if that speed doesn&#039;t &quot;just work&quot;? I bought some a pair of DDR4 3600 CL16 8GB sticks. I thought that all I would need to do is plug them in to my motherboard and I would get the advertised speed. But by default it was clocked way lower. So I used &quot;DOCP&quot; or whatever to set it to its rated profile and the computer became unusable because it constantly rebooted every few minutes until I disabled the overclock. Then I went down the rabbit hole and apparently overclocking ram, just to what it says on the box can be some fucking days long journey where tweak dozens of values in the hopes of getting a stable setup and then you have to run memory tests which last like a dozen hours and then you HOPE that its all stable at the end and doesn&#039;t fucking screw you at some vital moment.<br><br>So why are manufacturers allowed to write that shit on the box? They are advertising a theoretical speed which is bullshit right? If I buy a CPU it usually hits the clocks and boosts advertised on the box within some reasonable margin of error. Why is it so different with ram?<br><br>[spoiler]I&#039;m never going to build a computer again, this stuff is just silly.

In 3D rendering you can use GPU or CPU for rendering a final picture. The thing with CPU is that no matter how big your scene is, it will chug along and render it, even if it will need 100 years to do so. <br><br>CPU rendering is too slow to be used as any production scale for an individual person. Ever to rendering a few second commercial, one frame can take hours, and you need minimum 24 for 1 second of a video. CPU rendering is widely used by medium to big companies who can afford render farms with hundreds of cores running and working on rendering many frame at a time with many cores each at a time. <br><br>GPU rendering is much much faster. It allows individual creators to render frames at relatively good speed. The downside of that, you whole scene with all needed assets, like texture maps and so on need to fit in GPU VRAM.

The way I look at it, these cards are marketed primarily to gamers who want to run games at the highest settings, if the card takes 20ms instead of 16ms to render a frame when a bunch of complicated shaders and ray tracing and shit is running then it&#039;s junk to them and they&#039;ll shell out that extra cash to save those 4ms. But for AI it&#039;s not important and the only thing that matters is being reasonably fast + having a bunch of VRAM. At least that&#039;s what I&#039;d assume, given what I know about how ML works.

If you&#039;re interested in security, talk with the security guys at your company and see what they&#039;re working on. Grunt work eventually becomes more substantial projects as you learn the ropes, and good managers will recognize that.

When time comes around for a promotion, talk with your boss about moving into an entry level security role. Even if he doesn&#039;t say yes immediately, he might give you some pointers on what you should work on to eventually get there.

Spending over $1000 cans are marginally better than $400 ones, but $400 ones are hugely better than $100.", "filename": "IMAG0167.jpg.78492428fbcb974b112bbe78671a5c23", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2688, "h": 1520, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671663291381806, "time": 1671663291, "md5": "jFDafzdUVjBZr9pHqXzLSw==", "fsize": 494289, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90442372, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90438063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90438063</a><br>well done audeze HOWEVER...", "filename": "61SXEsFKA9L._AC_SX569_[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 569, "h": 681, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671663315088515, "time": 1671663315, "md5": "5pcM7eKGAAur73afHniWSw==", "fsize": 56509, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443383, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:53:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90439882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90439882</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$120 Dac Amp</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$300 headphones</span><br>sit and listen to my favorite music, it sounds way better, some parts of songs I feel like I&#039;ve never heard (subtle bass or highs). <br><br>$450.00, not much for a crazy enhancement of music if you are into it.", "time": 1671666782, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443430, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:55:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90438063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90438063</a><br>Spending more than $20 is retarded", "filename": "Zero-Salnotes-S2[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1663, "h": 834, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1671666929446735, "time": 1671666929, "md5": "sN/sGjz+XGe6Pg3lpJ+MBg==", "fsize": 83458, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443454, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:57:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90438063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90438063</a>", "filename": "audiophile", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671667053077790, "time": 1671667053, "md5": "qlYYsvcMgX1Z9DLSs9y9mA==", "fsize": 3000835, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443503, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:59:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90442196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90442196</a><br>This, the only good multi-thousand dollar headphones are the DCA Stealth and Expanse", "filename": "index[1]", "ext": ".png", "w": 994, "h": 628, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671667194695848, "time": 1671667194, "md5": "Ma+WQeeDKlZ6nUT7ObrlaA==", "fsize": 29375, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443551, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:02:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90443430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90443430</a><br> it\u2019s not even on his ranking", "time": 1671667359, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443594, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:05:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90443551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90443551</a><br>Because he doesn&#039;t rank or review things he worked on, as that would be a conflict of interests", "time": 1671667501, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443638, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:07:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90443594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90443594</a><br>So we\u2019ll never know if they\u2019re worth buying\u2026", "time": 1671667650, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443665, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:09:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90438063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90438063</a><br>no one cares<br>listening to a 96kbps mp3 with $5 gas station headphones is just as pleasurable as your $1000 headphones you bought off massdrop that don&#039;t even work until you hook them up to a $250 amp made by a company with a goofy name like &quot;shit&quot;", "time": 1671667749, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443684, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:10:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90443638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90443638</a><br>Graph looks great, every other reviewer says they&#039;re great, and they&#039;re dirt cheap<br>Only thing that could possibly fuck it up for you is them not fitting your ears properly", "time": 1671667804, "resto": 90438063}, {"no": 90443702, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:11:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90442196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90442196</a><br>Yes, it&#039;s a scientific fact the correlation between price and quality is weak.

I&#039;ve RMA&#039;d twice over the issue and it still persists, which leads me to believe its a &quot;feature&quot; and not a problem according to Sony.<br><br>I&#039;m never buying anything from Sony again if I can avoid it.", "filename": "IMG_0019", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671647485863875, "time": 1671647485, "md5": "Vl1WM98M0tnoY7HWkG5CPg==", "fsize": 1961030, "resto": 90433077}, {"no": 90437290, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)13:36:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90437175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90437175</a><br>do you use ldac? my chink mi buds 4 pro have ldac and it sounds so much better than stock aac", "time": 1671647796, "resto": 90433077}, {"no": 90437319, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)13:37:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90437175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90437175</a><br>Weird, I have a pair and I can&#039;t relate to anything you&#039;ve said.

The architecture is extremely complex, and without a solid grasp of advanced computer science most of the patterns will go over a typical coder&#039;s head. There&#039;s also Zuck&#039;s delusional outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Tom&#039;s Myspace design, for instance. The employees understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these patterns, to realise that they&#039;re not just efficient- they provide something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike MANGA codebases truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the elegance in Balmers&#039;s existential catchphrase &quot;Developers! Developers! Developers!,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Charle Babbages&#039;s acclaimed publication On the Economy of Machiner and Manufactures.

It&#039;s still more of a sidegrade if that, the fundamental frequencies of the female singing voice are located in the mids even at high pitches but sibilance, breathiness, and air are found in the treble so that&#039;s a key area, but the downside is sharpness. You can add some boost there with EQ and see if you like it.

Cut off my free service?-- rather than allow anyone with an IP to have a peek at my server. I don&#039;t have many people using the server, but among them are people that it would not surprise me if they use the same password for literally everything and haven&#039;t changed it in 15 years. At least with Cloudflare in between it limits the number of dumb attacks that can occur if someone&#039;s information is sitting in a list somewhere.", "time": 1671472855, "resto": 90388486}, {"no": 90395102, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:01:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i bought a bunch of drives for a nas build, fucking amazon.<br>ordered 6 drives.<br>4 came brand new<br>1 came used<br>1 came with a 3 year old manufacturer date<br>returned the used one<br>got another &quot;Sealed&quot; one with 3 hours on it, and 20 power cycles.<br>im sick of returning<br>is it better to have a drive that was made 3 years older than the rest, or use the 3 hour one?", "time": 1671472917, "resto": 90388486}, {"no": 90395326, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:14:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392590</a><br>i use cryptomator for putting my stuff in the cloud. all you really need.", "time": 1671473680, "resto": 90388486}, {"no": 90395399, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:18:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90395102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90395102</a><br>now that i look at them fucking amazon uses a different seller for half these drives so they have mismatched firmwares. ugh. is that a bad thing", "time": 1671473903, "resto": 90388486}, {"no": 90395498, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:23:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90395102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90395102</a><br>the 3 hour is insignificant, what you sperging about?", "time": 1671474228, "resto": 90388486}, {"no": 90395945, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:44:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90395498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90395498</a><br>because its used. 1 hour or 30 hour. dont care, i paid brand new, assholes try to sell me a returned item.<br>here is what i have: 5 drives right now on hand.

An interpreter can rewrite it&#039;s entire core and redefine every symbol and have equal or greater performance to how it started, whereas a compiled language gains 2-3 orders of magnitude speed in it&#039;s default state but slow exponentially as alterations are made to the core structure.

At best, certain parts of the language can be optimized and other parts left unrestricted but slower to reach a general compromise.<br>The upshot of this is that a highly effective compiler requires intimate knowledge of the language to function.

And since I already have open back headphones which I didn&#039;t know bass wasn&#039;t like a closedback I decided to get something with more bass. At first I thought the sound might not have been as good but comparing back to back it&#039;s the same clarity with just better bass in my opinion. The fit is ok, again way better than the samsung ones but the zeros have the best fit but it took me a while to used to them so it&#039;s probably the same for these. The cable is way worse than the 7hz tho. But on pic related the tip of the zeros bent a little easily in my laptop. Still works tho but never happened before with anything else I&#039;ve ever had so be careful. Recommend the waners instead if you&#039;re looking for an all rounder.

I used to think they were fishing for a buyout but the constant outages and the lobotomy yesterday made me think otherwise. It should be obvious by now they have no plan to expand their server capacity for real. If they wanted a buyout they needed to make a more polished product and a much larger user base. Is filter the product then? Unlikely. These devs worked on the fucking transformer itself it&#039;s beneath their expertise to work on a mere filter which doesn&#039;t even do its job properly. And a &quot;safe and harmless&quot; AI is more than just a filter. The dataset the model was trained on is even more important.

Other Linux players congratulate you on playing the game and on your level progression, giving you a real sense of accomplishment for your virtual progress.<br><br>If you thought you were getting a real OS, you just don&#039;t understand Linux.", "filename": "estimate", "ext": ".png", "w": 645, "h": 494, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1671462721706924, "time": 1671462721, "md5": "iqikcPry2O6N2iiAeoX3wA==", "fsize": 18694, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392097, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:13:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90391975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90391975</a><br><a href=\"#p90392075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392075</a><br>not like this freetards....", "filename": "lintards", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 486, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1671462793370274, "time": 1671462793, "md5": "Qm5f9VoF/ya6X+rni7+0FA==", "fsize": 28685, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392356, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:29:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90391975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90391975</a><br>kek", "time": 1671463762, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392792, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:52:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bros ....<br>is gnome riceable or am I fucked ?<br>Pop OS had prebuilt NVIDIA drivers I swear it was for the best ....", "filename": "1650611646138", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671465169044374, "time": 1671465169, "md5": "YzuTWyDL517X9SvaJe9slQ==", "fsize": 622318, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394119, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-19 09-39-33", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671469556209126, "time": 1671469556, "md5": "t0MV2Te9nqf4+6/9/AbYaQ==", "fsize": 476097, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394289, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:14:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389044</a><br>Ok since this is a new thread how do I make linux look like windows XP or windows 7, I don&#039;t care what desktop environments I use, I been trying to find tutorials or themes but all of them are outdated.", "time": 1671470090, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394314, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:16:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392792</a><br>You don&#039;t need any of that just use the lutrius/ proton for your needs<br>Green drivers are fine if you&#039;re on the 3000 series and lower", "filename": "Screenshot_20221219_121329", "ext": ".png", "w": 2560, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671470161128846, "time": 1671470161, "md5": "oizrUETaOimHaLzne1lDnw==", "fsize": 3587520, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394419, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:22:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392040</a><br>Those colors look really nice.", "time": 1671470565, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394456, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:24:42", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "heh", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671470682827916, "time": 1671470682, "md5": "BrS/NcfzN9OcUOTNGHPVjA==", "fsize": 760831, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394519, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90394419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90394419</a><br>Thanks, I never change colorschemes so all my apps and wallpapers have the same gruvbox theme.", "time": 1671470929, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394688, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:36:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392040</a><br>what UI is that? looks nice", "time": 1671471419, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394703, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:38:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90394688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90394688</a><br>bspwm with polybar; the terminal is floating purely for aesthetic purposes", "time": 1671471514, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395034, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:58:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90390347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90390347</a><br>i said this to your mother when i woke up next to her the morning after", "time": 1671472704, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395079, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:00:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Mint is very comfy", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-19 19-43-45", "ext": ".png", "w": 2560, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671472849322493, "time": 1671472849, "md5": "ze+0ESFDVx5nMjR9GF5Yzw==", "fsize": 3401661, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395088, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389044</a><br>Oh cool.

I&#039;ve been using it for a few years now and for the most part it works fine, but every now and then there&#039;s something that&#039;s just broken. Usually it will run if you put a compatibility layer called steam-run first in the command, but sometimes even that doesn&#039;t help in which case you can&#039;t just compile from source normally, you need to actually write a package declaration for the package manager and install it that way.<br><br>I struggle through because I think NixOS is really cool, but it&#039;s definitely more difficult than something like Arch and for very little benefit. Does have some nice features, for example I have one computername.nix file for each of my machines, which has a different include list, which all pull from the same folder on my NAS. For example the machine I&#039;m using as NAS doesn&#039;t pull in software.nix or display.nix, and my laptop and desktop won&#039;t pull in wireguard-server.nix and nas-server.nix, but they do instead get wireguard-client.nix and nas-client.nix. For example when I replaced alsa with pipewire, I only needed to make the change once, in a file I creatively called audio.nix, and then make sure it worked on one of my machines. Then I just included that file on the other machines, did a nixos-rebuild, and nix took care of fiddling with the configs for me.<br><br>It&#039;s basically got two use cases.

It started when I was about 12 and I am still on it. The problem is that I never finished a single project, ever, at all, neither did I learn a single programming language properly. I have tried out everything pretty much to a certain degree. Python, Lua, Ruby, PHP, C99, Java, Posix Shell scripting, Javascript, C#, Scheme LISP. I tried web development (backend and frontend), game programming (writing mods and stand-alone games, at least I tried to do so), shell scripting, mobile apps and so on. OOP, functional programming, even logic programming (Stuff like Prolog), all of it. Nothing got me any results at all, after a lot of years of doing so. I am very interested in it and I do not want to drop it, but I want to start of again from scratch.<br>I am going to do the code of advent, even though I am pretty late on it, in the language you recommend me and do everything in it. I have read SICP and I happen to like the simplicity of Scheme, but other LISP dialects too. LISP is great, but I feel like it isn&#039;t a good language to start with, no matter the implementation. The language should be general-purpose, as I want to get really good at it, so I have at least one language I know properly. Scripting languages like Python, Lua, Ruby and Perl are fine too. I think the JVM is great. Generally I like functional programming more than OOP, but I would program in an OOP language too if it was good.<br><br>So, what language should I go with?", "filename": "dacd36dd47f782b846ed29a5546f772e", "ext": ".png", "w": 894, "h": 934, "tn_w": 239, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671693728351535, "time": 1671693728, "md5": "n4h/5RAec8PZmOCZ4x0o3w==", "fsize": 851317, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "learning-a-programming-language-properly-for-once", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 90449776, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:23:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Haskell.", "time": 1671693837, "resto": 90449747}, {"no": 90449799, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)02:25:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90449776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90449776</a><br>What are the advantages of Haskell?

After around 10 minutes, Windows finally booted up but was missing one of my non-system drives. I rebooted only to be greeted with another 10 minutes of nothing followed by something along the lines of &quot;An operating system couldn&#039;t be found&quot;. Not knowing what the fuck else to do, I just unplugged everything from the wall socket, couldn&#039;t think of anything after another 10 minutes and out of desperation tried to turn it back on only to be greeted with a usually quick and normal Windows boot as if nothing at all happened.
