They would spam the board with their nonsensical gibberish, trying to pass themselves off as real users. But we were too smart for that. We could spot a chatbot from a mile away, and we would mercilessly mock and ridicule them. It was like shooting fish in a barrel.<br><br>    But let me tell you, shit was so cash back then. We were the original trolls, dominating the internet and causing chaos wherever we went. None of this Reddit or Twitter bullshit, /g/ was where the real action was.<br><br>    And don&#039;t even get me started on the navy seal copypasta. That was the ultimate burn, the ultimate flex. Whenever someone would try to come at us with some weak ass attempt at trolling, we would just drop the navy seal copypasta and watch them crumble.<br><br>    But alas, those were the good old days. Nowadays, /g/ is a shadow of its former self. The chatbots have taken over, the oldfags have moved on, and the newfags don&#039;t even know what real trolling is.

Please take everything with a grain of salt, this is purely my brain dumping onto a page while I was sleep deprived. At the bottom I included a handful of caveats to things I said. Also, I am specifically choosing to use the word &quot;AI&quot; over the term &quot;Machine Learning.&quot; Current machine learning like ChatGPT is a huge step towards true AIs, but we still have a long way to go. I am in no way an expert on any of these topics and its entirely likely that everything I said is wrong.<br><br>Any time someone envisions a Utopia in fiction, where are the people who do the work to build that society? Best case scenario all the work has been replaced by robots, and worse case there ends up being some kind of indentured servitude hidden in the shadows. Obviously for a long time this has been simply fiction, but with the new buzz around ChatGPT I thought I&#039;d share an idea I&#039;ve had for a while now. <br><br>Throughout history, the large majority of problems faced by society have happened because of one thing; greed. Greed for power, greed for money, etc, etc. Assuming that in a vacuum humans wouldn&#039;t just resort back to greed, how can we prevent inequality from happening? I believe that AI and robots could be our solution.  <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Abolishing Money </span><br>Lets start with monetary greed.
