Turns out that the reason these grey boxes appear is because DWM enforces a 4-byte pixel format that the game simply wasn&#039;t made for, and if DWM is forced to allocate the game&#039;s native 2-byte pixel format this stupid piece of trashware performs a format conversion upon every single frame using an algorithm that challenges molasses in January in terms of slowness.<br><br>But: entering exclusive fullscreen mode once (ALT+Enter) puts DWM out of the composition loop.

At 25-30, the skeletal structure is fully developed so there&#039;s no longer a way to determine age. So when you hear someone declare a caveman to have died at an age over about 25, that&#039;s a combination of the fully developed bone structure and the assumption that cavemen couldn&#039;t have lived long lives. But if you go and look at primitive tribal cultures that still exist today, you&#039;ll find that they have living great-grandparents still hanging around at 70+. There&#039;s no reason why this wouldn&#039;t be true of cave men as well, especially since many of them would have been living in areas that are very optimal for human habitation, while the only places where primitive tribes still exist are pretty much all inhospitable shitholes that don&#039;t have cities built on top of them for a reason.", "time": 1676460469, "resto": 91550691}, {"no": 91552763, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Corrupted webm?", "time": 1676460687, "resto": 91550691}, {"no": 91552781, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:32:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91552712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91552712</a><br>don&#039;t they determine age by calculating decay of radioactive materials in your bones?", "time": 1676460778, "resto": 91550691}, {"no": 91552784, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:33:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550691</a><br>you just know a pedo wrote this script", "time": 1676460793, "resto": 91550691}, {"no": 91552839, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:38:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550691</a><br>Yes.

Warning: I have some orchestral background and mainly listen to classical and video game OSTs with the remainder being weebcore, old rap,and rock<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Treble seems somewhat subdued and lacking in detail compared to Variations but is great overall. Violins seem a bit duller than they sound IRL. FH3 frequently ruins its decent treble with it&#039;s bass bloat.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can hear the resonance of background glockenspiels ring and slowly fade out like with the Variations. However, with the Afuls, they are more likely to be muffled if there&#039;s too much going on.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Female vocals are forward and detailed but not as good as the Variations. I don&#039;t watch or like ASMR but with Variations you can hear the smallest articulations...Almost too intimate.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lower mids and upper midbass are excellent overall. Cellos, violas, and male vocals sound rich and full. FH3s are shockingly decent here as well as long as there&#039;s no sub-bass simultaneously. The Variations weren&#039;t much better in this category. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Good bass, a little too boomy at some sub frequencies but music never becomes &quot;muddy&quot; like with the FH3s. Variations&#039; bass is cleaner and is adequately punchy</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Much more open sounding than FH3s (No underwater effect). Variations sound slightly better in this area.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Detail and separation is significantly better than FH3s but noticeably worse than the Variations. For example, you can accurately count the number of female singers in a small group with the Variations and the Afuls but not the FH3s.</span><br><br>Overall, if the Variations are a 4.75/5, then the Afuls are 4/5, and the FH3s are around 2.75/5. I&#039;ve tried the B2Dusks as well. I think the Afuls would come very close to rivaling them.

This approach gives you full control over the authentication process, but also requires a significant amount of time and effort to implement securely.<br><br>Use a third-party authentication service: This involves using a service provided by a company that specializes in authentication. Examples of such services include Auth0, Firebase Authentication, and Okta. This approach can save you time and effort compared to rolling your own authentication, but may also come with limitations and restrictions, and can be more expensive.<br><br>Use a third-party library: This involves using a pre-written library or module to handle authentication for you. Examples of popular libraries include Passport.js, Devise, and django-allauth. This approach can save you time and effort compared to writing your own authentication code, and may be more secure than using a third-party service, but still requires a certain level of understanding and customization to meet your specific needs.<br><br>In general, my recommendation would be to use a third-party library if you are developing in a framework or language that has a widely-used and well-maintained library available, as this will provide a good balance between security, ease of use, and flexibility. If no such library exists, or if you have specific requirements that can&#039;t be met by existing libraries, you may want to consider using a third-party service. Rolling your own authentication should generally be a last resort, as it is time-consuming and challenging to implement securely.", "time": 1676317073, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513019, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:39:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91512986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91512986</a><br>Typical ChatGPT answer, more or less correct but completely useless.", "time": 1676317153, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513042, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:40:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91513019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513019</a><br>well it at least confirmed to me that I wouldn&#039;t be wrong going with something like firebase which is what I want to do, I just want something that lets people signup/log in with google and then pay me for using my app", "time": 1676317218, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513421, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:57:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I finally tried out chatgpt today for the first time and while it felt scary in the beginning eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat honestly. the hype is massively overblown. it is just a simple ML model running at a large scale. you guys have nothing to fear<br><br>however it does present a huge threat to google as I think it&#039;s most popular use is going to be like a better google. although the cost per query is likely to be insanely high to openAI, remains to be seen how they figure out that part before they get crushed by their own success", "time": 1676318258, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91513459, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "getting my head around an object literal containing function definitions is going to take me some time", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 609, "h": 365, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1676318348012009, "time": 1676318348, "md5": "c79DUuMFQwVlD29g6FpzZQ==", "fsize": 56491, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514105, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:25:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91513421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513421</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I finally tried out chatgpt today for the first time and while it felt scary in the beginning eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat honestly.</span><br>this<br>it takes a coder to spot it&#039;s faults, given that its made by coders its not hard to spot them<br>normies are fucking idiots <br>you&#039;re preaching to the choir here", "time": 1676319919, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514218, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:30:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91514105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91514105</a><br><a href=\"#p91513421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91513421</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually I realized it wasn&#039;t a threat</span><br>it will be, have you seen copilot? it&#039;s gonna get there, and beyond", "time": 1676320245, "resto": 91512301}, {"no": 91514264, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:32:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who created the &#039;&#039;devs are well-paid&#039;&#039; meme that&#039;s been floating around?

I have worked multiple php jobs, some startups and some euro industry leader in their field. At one of the startups we basically made a monolith, but even that was a REST backend. At the industry leader for example we have a pretty complex microservice architecture all written in php. It is possible, even easy once you realize how it all works. The weird thing is how little you see of this stuff in public. Even the php docs use HTML in PHP, which I have never used/seen in my career at any job I had. One of the sites you visit might even use php without knowing. It doesn&#039;t even have to show a .php at all, you can get around that with nginx or apache. All you&#039;ll see is that you send a request to api.some.site/v2/User/Register and get back a json response in return. You would never know if it was python, node or php unless they told you specifically. But yeah all that wordpress shit and indian tier coding gets this ecosystem a bad rep, eventhough its pretty good imho.

Sony have good ANC and bad sound, Bose have good ANC and bad sound, other headphones have good sound and bad ANC, third phones would be OK but the firmware glitches all the time and you need to reboot them. <br><br>None of them are worth 300$, that&#039;s too much for a product that has &quot;buts&quot; and concessions. Maybe it would take Samsung to create the Galaxy Phones Pro for the market to learn.<br><br><a href=\"#p91552794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91552794</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I were in the market for a pair of wireless ANC cans that aren&#039;t total bass cannons (Sony XMwhatever).</span><br><br>1more sonofow peoduce a very neutral boring sound that you can EQ however you want into a more fun V.", "time": 1676462672, "resto": 91547424}, {"no": 91553260, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:11:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91547424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91547424</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;curryPods</span>", "filename": "1659714956456", "ext": ".png", "w": 1246, "h": 736, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 73, "tim": 1676463072864316, "time": 1676463072, "md5": "eZHiPeH6bTY8ze8BtgCcnQ==", "fsize": 708089, "resto": 91547424}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 91550262, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)02:47:18", "name": "Cheshire", "com": "does ubuntu studio just work like windows 10 for daw or guitar amp simulators?", "filename": "0496", "ext": ".png", "w": 157, "h": 156, "tn_w": 157, "tn_h": 156, "tim": 1676447238816215, "time": 1676447238, "md5": "JVr8nzuRGJtSW5/cmicJJQ==", "fsize": 10542, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-ubuntu-studio-just-work-like-windows-10-for", "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 91550493, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:08:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550262</a><br>no, vst support on linux is basically nonexistent. just run ubuntu + a windows vm", "time": 1676448501, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91552022, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550262</a><br>bump", "time": 1676456993, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91552066, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:32:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550262</a><br>Works on my machine and it was some obscure Chinese daw<br><br>Idk look into it", "time": 1676457176, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91552095, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:35:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91550493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91550493</a><br>/thread<br><a href=\"#p91552022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91552022</a><br>You\u2019re beyond help", "time": 1676457326, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91552111, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "god, fucking no<br>please<br><br>t. spent the better part of a year trying to figure something with LMMS, Bitwig, etc<br>It just DOESN&#039;T FUCKING WORK", "time": 1676457420, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91553129, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:01:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91552066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91552066</a><br>bump", "time": 1676462491, "resto": 91550262}, {"no": 91553148, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:02:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "wish the bots would stop bumping this fucking retarded thread", "time": 1676462553, "resto": 91550262}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 91533186, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)10:19:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OLED bros ... not like this ...<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YB<wbr>JFYGtmQk", "filename": "CRT_vs_OLED_motion_clarity", "ext": ".png", "w": 840, "h": 1044, "tn_w": 201, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676387942459689, "time": 1676387942, "md5": "4dy6f9ay50Cl6CuuTGcPCQ==", "fsize": 969849, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "oled-bros-not-like-this", "replies": 176, "images": 45, "unique_ips": 61, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 91533275, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)10:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m not watching 35min of some soiboy cuck just to reply to &quot;X bros.. not like this...&quot;

Just motion clarity and response time?</span><br>No, they&#039;re incredibly flexible monitors with adequate-to-godtier performance all-around. <br>Motion clarity of course is the biggest advantage CRTs have, especially at lower refresh rates. Almost no other monitors can display your 60hz locked 2D games and low-fps AAA as cleanly as a CRT can. Thanks to the clarity, a CRT punches way above its refresh rate in esports games too, a tube has you covered in any refresh range. <br>On top of that, we also have just the raw picture quality of a good tube. Compared to LCD monitors, these things just don&#039;t have big flaws. The contrast is really great and colors quite adequate (~sRGB). We have god-tier gray uniformity and perfect viewing angles; no IPS glow, no bleed, nothing like that. And funny enough, those few strobing LCDs and OLEDs are always MUCH DIMMER than some of the later 120+ nit Trinitrons and Diamondtrons.<br>Multisync is also quite a feature to have, it alone makes CRTs worth to keep around. You&#039;re able to display anything from 480p retro arcade games to 1440p AAA natively, on the same monitor! Even if we do finally get good BFI OLEDs, I&#039;ll still keep a CRT just for that clean 480p rendering. <br><br>So my argument is, a CRT will just play every game you throw at it and it&#039;ll perform. There&#039;s not a single other monitor out there with such versatility.<br>I like to call LCD gaming monitors &quot;Esports Ewaste&quot;. Sure, many LCD gaming monitors will technically be better for Counter-Strike than a CRT, but that LCD will also be absolutely fucking useless for any other game. You&#039;re not even good enough where the difference between a good CRT and top LCD is worth noting!

How is it that motion performance would objectively materially matter in a sense where it matters enough to make everything else obsolete? Because it doesn&#039;t. If it actually mattered in an area where its benefits are most shown like in sports or gaming, then CRTs which are the best at motion clarity would still be used. Instead, sports are using tablets inside an enclosure for doing replay reviews with referees on the field.<br><br>https://twitter.com/SBNation/status<wbr>/893293363545419777<br><br>And you have to go down the list from esports games that had the biggest prize pools to number 26 to see a game that did use CRTs at one point before they all switched to TFT LCDs with Brood War.<br><br>https://www.esportsearnings.com/gam<wbr>es<br><br>NFL games and esports tournament have multiple of millions on the line. If the advantage in motion clarity truly mattered, there would still be uses of CRTs in those fields but there aren&#039;t. I doubt anyone else has a valid objective usecase for CRTs over what those two fields had usecases for that would be worth over the multiple of millions that would make CRTs worth it. All that the better motion performance metric is being used on the internet for the most part is as a overwhelming exception to beat down arguments as a logical fallacy.

What you&#039;re refering to as backlight, is in fact, a front light, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, light from the front. Backlight is not an universal lighting solution unto itself, but rather another physical component of a fully functioning LCD system made useful by the LCD panel, polarization filter and vital system components comprising a full display as defined by IEEE.<br><br>Many e-reader users run a modified version of the front light system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of light which is widely used today is often called backlight, and many of its users are not aware that it is actually a front light, shining light on top of the screen.<br><br>There really are backlights, and these people are using them, but it is just a part liquid crystal displays. Backlight is the illumination solution on a LCD: the lightsource that illuminates the panel so they can be seen. The backlight is an essential part of an liquid crystal display, but useless on an e-reader; it can only function in the context of a complete liquid crystal display. e-ink is normally used in combination with a front light: the whole system is basically a light shining on top of the screen, or front light.

But, sometimes not from the program directly, you&#039;ll have to go through the kernel.<br><br>You see, when a kernel multiplexes the hardware for multiple programs to run at the same time, it creates virtual memory called pages. Pages are the kernel&#039;s virtual memory space, and when it&#039;s on a physical portion of RAM, it&#039;s called a frame. The kernel will monitor the memory usage, and if it goes out of page, it&#039;ll create a page fault, and re-allocate another page to support the new memory, and your program will suddenly work a lot slower. You can mitigate this by &quot;locking pages&quot; ahead of time, to tell the kernel that you&#039;ll need X bytes of memory and it&#039;ll allocate it ahead of time. <br><br>But, if you have root access to the kernel, you CAN modify memory in other running programs just as you say. In windows, there&#039;s a program called Cheat Engine, that will allow you to do this in video games, and on GNU+Linux, the program is called scanmem. Let&#039;s say you have a health bar, and the number is 100. You scan the memory of the program for the number 100, and you get a bunch of numbers at a bunch of memory locations. You take damage, and the health goes to 85, and you scan again, using the same memory locations, and now you have only one location with the number 85! You have found the location in memory where the health is stored! Now, you can &quot;lock&quot; it to 100, and you will always have 100 health in the game!<br><br>This is the essence of hacking, young padawan.

Thousands of years of technological advancement have allowed them to recognize and reject inefficiency with incredible efficiency.

Eventually it&#039;ll be too much to bear - you&#039;ll give up your dreams, abandon your ambitions, and cease to strive. Your friends will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They&#039;ll bury you in a commoner&#039;s grave, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a non-developer is buried there.
