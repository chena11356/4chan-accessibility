It knows this because it knows where it isn&#039;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#039;t, or where it isn&#039;t from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the beacon from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#039;t, and arriving at a position that it wasn&#039;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn&#039;t, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn&#039;t. In the event that the position that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#039;t, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the beacon is and where it wasn&#039;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the beacon must also know where it was. The beacon guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#039;t, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#039;t, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#039;t be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.</span>", "filename": "carbon", "ext": ".png", "w": 1666, "h": 2768, "tn_w": 75, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671107019393503, "time": 1671107019, "md5": "d/HvPdXOknjMt3eM53m8WA==", "fsize": 3336976, "resto": 90307611}, {"no": 90311079, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)07:26:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Did people really get filtered by this?

I don&#039;t expect the full power of template meta programming in C++ or anything; writing something like a generic function wrapper is impossible, for example (it actually is possible with a bunch of calls to the reflection library, but its convoluted and obtuse). <br><br>Despite being a compiled language, its pretty idiomatic to be completely lackadaisical with it. For example, the Context() object is meant to contain context for a thread generally, and is passed into each function. Inside of the context object is a map[interface{}]interface{}, which is effectively a map[void*]void* in C/C++. Again, passing stuff in the context object, like loggers for example, is incredibly common, but all it creates is blob of data who you need to be careful using since the compiler wont help. <br><br>The lack of a const key is just terrible. Like C, everything is still passed in by copy, so if you want a reference, you should pass a pointer. Unlike C, if you pass a pointer to a struct into a function, you don&#039;t have the slightest clue what its actually doing. And despite everything being passed by copy, there isn&#039;t any formal overloading. So if you take a list by value, for example, it does copy the list, but it does that by just copying the first list&#039;s pointer to its array into the second list, meaning the function can still mutate the original one. <br><br>There is a copy function, which you can use, except the return value is how many bytes were copied, instead of the copied item, meaning if you ever want to pass a copy into a function, you need to create a named temporary variable to store it in, then call the function. I wouldn&#039;t mind if everything was just a reference like in other GC languages, but its not, so you are still forced to use raw, unsafe pointers everywhere.", "time": 1671072183, "resto": 90295458}, {"no": 90304173, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90303696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90303696</a><br>Same poster here, can anyone tell me how to make this edit without fancy syntax pls", "time": 1671072251, "resto": 90295458}, {"no": 90304208, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:47:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90304158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90304158</a><br>The range operator is also very annoying to use. <br><br>In C++, you can do:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">for (const auto&amp; item : vec) { ... }<br></pre><br><br>And you get efficient refences to the items in the vec. <br><br>In go, the range operator looks like:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">for idx, item := range mylist { ... }<br></pre><br><br>The problem is that &quot;item&quot; here is _always_ a copy.

A shopping bag that folds down quite small so I can always carry it in my jacket and forget about it - $1.47, paid $1.29<br>Would have preferred if the bag and the outer shell were connected, everything else seems fine. Seams don&#039;t look ass, but not enforced or anything either. Should last for a while if you take proper care, but it&#039;ll eventually break. For the price, that seems like a fair tradeoff. <br>2. Capsule knife - $2.49, paid $2.10 <br>Nice quality and small, but getting replacement blades will probably be a pain. Great to have in your jacket though, for the times I don&#039;t have my opinel with me. <br>3. Melamine sponges - $5.31, paid $4.58 for 100<br>Ran out of my old ones, these are new ones. They work just as well as any other one, which means they work great. <br>4. Folding fork, spoon and two screw on chopsticks - paid $3.66<br>These are amazing. Feel high quality, the locking mechanism works great, time will tell how well they hold up/how good the stainless is. They come with a nice little bag to carry them in, very happy, especially for the price.<br>5. A molle pouch with various inner compartments and some space - \u20ac4,75<br>Will replace the ziploc bag I used to carry my first aid kit when hiking/outdoors. Materials are what you&#039;d expect, seams seem fine. Pleasantly surprised by the organizational options. Will make finding the right thing when it&#039;s dark much easier.

Import tax also doesn&#039;t apply until you order something over \u20ac150 which if I recall correctly should also be included upon checkout with IOSS.<br><br>This change means you now pay more on smaller items, which sucks. Some smaller items are now (almost) the same price on Amazon Germany with next day delivery, so it helps to look around before ordering. But this change also opened the door to fast consolidated shipping (10~14 days), buying &gt;\u20ac22 items and no longer having to tactically split up orders to avoid customs.", "time": 1671024258, "resto": 90269961}, {"no": 90291856, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)08:37:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90291712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90291712</a><br>Thanks boss", "time": 1671025029, "resto": 90269961}, {"no": 90292189, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:04:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90291712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90291712</a><br>I&#039;d largely agree.

I see you currently live in X. What makes you want to make to switch from X in the US to a small country in Europe like the Netherlands?<br><br>What attracts you in a company like ours?<br>What would you like to see different in our role what you are currently missing in your current role? <br>Your CV already tells us a lot about your educational background and work experience, but not so much about yourself. Can you tell us a bit more about that?<br>- Because you originally come from outside of the European Union we have to consider you as a so called highly skilled migrant. For that reason it is important to know your birth of date, would you like to share that with us? <br>- How is your personal situation?<br>- Which tasks and responsibilities give you energy and which certainly do not?<br>- What are your ambitions, in the shorter and longer term?<br>- How would people describe you?<br>I have no idea about terms of employment in the States, but could you tell us something about your salary expectations? <br>If you would join us you will be seen as a knowledge migrant.  We will have to pay you a minimal amount and you also will have the possibility to apply for the 30% ruling, what gives you a discount on your labour taxes for the coming 5 years. <br>I&#039;ll await your answers patiently and hope to invite you soon afterwards.<br>I can also imagine you would have some questions for us?

By that I mean, it pretty much never sequentially uses the EXACT same color pixel to pixel. It uses adjacent colors in the color space and you end up with things being like webm related. And this is something that just does not fucking exist in &quot;actual&quot; digital art. You would actually have to try really, really, really fucking hard to create art that has no sequential patches of the same color manually, especially when you consider that the &#039;adjacent&#039; colors it uses are actually pretty far apart in RGB/CMYK values.<br>So, with knowing this, if someone REALLY wanted to automate a way to filter AI art, it legitimately wouldn&#039;t be very hard.

The idea behind this technique is to create a stable, well-behaved model that can accurately predict the output of a system based on the inputs. This is typically done by training multiple models on the same data and then combining the predictions of these models in a way that minimizes the overall error. There are a few different ways to combine the predictions of multiple models, but one common approach is to use a weighted average of the predictions, where the weights are determined based on the performance of each individual model. This can help to improve the overall accuracy of the combined model by taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each individual model.</pre>", "time": 1671105364, "resto": 90308734}, {"no": 90310704, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:56:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90310689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90310689</a><br>this", "time": 1671105372, "resto": 90308734}, {"no": 90310710, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:56:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;9</span>I0310606<br>I can play dx11 games, do everything normal.As soon as I load up a dx12 game or RTX? it crashes hard", "time": 1671105418, "resto": 90308734}, {"no": 90310739, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:59:10", "name": "Ohnononanonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90310710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90310710</a><br>It sounds like you are experiencing a problem with your graphics driver or hardware.

You don&#039;t like IP because you feel that you shouldn&#039;t have to pay people for their work. If you dig down past all the rationalization and BS that&#039;s the crux of it. If I write a book why should I have to compete with other publishers to make a profit on it. They did none of the work and they are not paying me, but they are copying my work. Copyright protects the rights of people who actually produced something and aren&#039;t leeching value. You argue for laws that don&#039;t serve the common good and would make goods and services instill more pay walls and protections.  It would make all the experiences worst. It would also discourage those who are productive in those fields from producing things we enjoy. The computing era has made this theft more abstract so it is harder to notice, but it is still theft. If you took a persons goods without paying them they would starve because you deprived them of the value they were owned for producing it. It is the same with copyright material on the internet. You deprive artist, musicians, and writers value they are owned. You saying they didn&#039;t provide value or that you never intended to pay for it anyway does not change that. If you said you didn&#039;t want to pay for food because you would never spend money on that, that wouldn&#039;t make you entitled to the food.  Your entertainment has some intrinsic value to you and obviously it is worth something because you do spend money in some forms of entertainment and the effort you are willing to go through in order to satiate it.

I&#039;m trying to find Spanish language audio movies and TV shows, as in stuff that was originally in Spanish as opposed to dubs, with Spanish subtitles. It doesn&#039;t matter if they are SHD subs or just regular. I&#039;m an English speaker who is far enough along in learning Spanish that I can watch stuff with Spanish audio and Spanish subs to read along; not advanced enough to just listen to the audio alone and probably won&#039;t be for years.<br><br>A lot of the movies on PTP or shows on BTN that are from Spanish speaking countries tend to not have the Spanish subs. I&#039;m not sure if they were ripped or never available in the first place. A lot of the discs I rent from Netflix to rip have the Spanish subs present, but many don&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping that Spanish trackers might have people ripping them from releases in Spanish speaking countries, which would be more likely to have Spanish subs. Finding them on external subtitle sites is very hit or miss, as is the quality of the translations.<br><br>I know as hard as HD Spain is to get into I&#039;d have to be mayor of Madrid for at least a few years before I got an invite, but does anyone have any other leads? I recently joined Lat-Team and it&#039;s lacking in the content area.

I don&#039;t need a fuck-huge backpack that you could do a three-day camping trip with, just something moderately sized, but I wanna make sure I can actually fit my laptop in it. <br><br>Any recommendations?", "time": 1670937111, "resto": 90258407}, {"no": 90272568, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:27:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90271892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90271892</a><br>I don&#039;t believe that price includes shipping.
