The RFDS will use Starlink&#039;s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communications services to provide connectivity to healthcare providers in rural Queensland, while Tototheo will resell services to ship operators within the merchant shipping, offshore, yachting, and fishing industries.<br><br>Founded in 1928, the RFDS is a non-profit air medical service in Australia that provides healthcare services for people living in remote and rural areas of the country who might not be able to gain regular healthcare due to long distances. Last month, a Starlink panel was installed on the roof of the Urandangi Health Clinic in Queensland, which is serviced by RFDS&#039; Mount Isa-based crew. It is the first of three planned deployments aiming to boost connectivity and efficiency for the service&#039;s remote workforce.", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-25 at 19-09-40 SpaceX\u2019s Starlink signs deals with Flying Doctor service and Tototheo Maritime", "ext": ".png", "w": 447, "h": 322, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 180, "tim": 1674637945725970, "time": 1674637945, "md5": "iSGMaTx4TrBjMSt4A4o74g==", "fsize": 169567, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "spacexs-starlink-signs-deals-with-flying-doctor", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 91109030, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)04:12:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "RFDS&#039; Queensland section digital infrastructure program manager Adam Carey said the satellite service is an extension to RFDS&#039; existing wide area network and would allow the organization to extend coverage for crews delivering healthcare services in the furthest corners of Queensland.

Model-View-Controller, ORMs, all that convoluted garbage, very bad way to start.<br><br>FIRST, learn the protocols:  DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP/S, and CGI.  Read docs and even review RFCs if you feel like it. Set up your own webserver with netcat and practice sending HTTP requests with curl.  Observe the structure of the requests as they are seen by your webserver and see if you can craft a request by hand using telnet.  Once comfortable, set up a classic Apache HTTP server.  Don&#039;t bother with PHP yet, learn how to enable CGI and how to automatically generate an HTTP response to a request using a shell script.  This is not an efficient way to run a production service, so why learn it?  The point is to practice hand-crafting simple scripted HTTP responses from scratch with no abstractions so you understand what web frameworks are actually doing for you.<br><br>NEXT learn to use MySQL or Postgres.  Learn to write raw SQL.  Learn how to set up a database and schema, how to populate tables and run queries.  Ideally, learn some principles of data modeling and how to actually use these tools well.  Be comfortable with what these databases can do and what they can&#039;t.  Think about when it makes sense to use one or when it might not be needed.  Find some examples in several different programming languages for standard ways to query a database.

If you&#039;re talking about cold starts (startup time for serverless), again, i would agree with you. But when it comes to computing and i/o, PHP 8 is actually slightly faster (not slower than Node). In addition to that, it can scale vertically way better than node because of a much better support for parallelism.

So I guess my followup questions would be: (1) is Arch secure and stable these days on non-problem hardware, and (2) is openSUSE something that will still be maintained actively in 5 years time like Arch will more than likely be?<br><br>Sorry if this is worded oddly, I&#039;m out of it for some reason today", "time": 1674611086, "resto": 91092167}, {"no": 91103747, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there anyway to use btrfs as root on the latest alma Linux", "time": 1674611211, "resto": 91092167}, {"no": 91103863, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:55:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s a good OS for people with boomer parents with Windows-only experience?", "time": 1674611723, "resto": 91092167}, {"no": 91103880, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:56:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91102120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91102120</a><br>That&#039;s the Windows Terminal font right?

The days of extending programs with scripting and macros are dying.<br>The FoNC managed to turn around quite a few innovations. Because of the SLoC constraint they devised several domain-specific languages for different tasks, with a hybrid Smalltalk and Scheme-like language as the basis. C could be freely intermixed in that language; this is how the bootstrap problem (high-level language atop bare metal) was solved. <br>Check out https://github.com/robertpfeiffer/c<wbr>ola/blob/master/function/examples/t<wbr>cp/net-tcp.k<br>This is part of the FoNC networking stack. Notice the TCP packet ASCII diagram. It is not a comment. There is a tiny domain-specific language called structure-diagram which turns an ASCII art diagram into definitions suitable for manipulating it. This eliminates much boilerplate. structure-diagram itself is implemented in another domain-specific language, OMeta, which is for defining parsers.<br>And another language, NILE, is used for stream processing - used in FoNC to handle rendering, rasterisation, texturing, and suchlike.

It&#039;s nice than my 1080, 24inch in every way.<br>However I&#039;ve noticed an issue with looking at the monitor. Everything is much much smaller while being much bigger. For example the catalog has 14 threads in a row on this monitor, and only 10 on the smaller one. The trade off being the text, pictures, and everything else is much much smaller than they&#039;d be on the smaller monitor.  And for games, (FFXIV in this case) I find essentially no difference between total screen space between the 2 monitors. Like the same amount of space between say the hotbar and the end of the screen, is the same proportionate space between the 2 monitors.<br>So the main question is: how do I combat this, or adjust to this? Do I make my game UI smaller so essentially I have a much bigger field of view, and then the entire ui is much smaller? And in that case, do I.. sit closer to my screen? Currently I&#039;m like 24-30 inches away from my screen. I don&#039;t need to &quot;strain&quot; my eyes to read any text like in this thread for example, but it is almost tedious in a way, compared to the smaller monitor, since it&#039;s all so tiny in comparison. I think my question is more or less a sort of ergonomics thing, as opposed to just finding a personal preference type deal, since I&#039;ve tried some different things but muscle memory is hard to break and I can&#039;t be changing distance, sizes, etc constantly since these things take quite a while to properly get used to in the first place.<br>tldr do I sit closer to bigger monitor with smaller UI/HUD / text. Or do I maintain distance, and make everything larger / zoom in.

After all back then, most rugged phones only had shitty budget peasant phone performance since the manufacturers skimped on performance for the water and dust proofing and huge batteries. But the &quot;flagship&quot; rugged phones like the Ulefone Power Armor 18T, Doogee V30 and Oukitel&#039;s WP21 have Dimensity 900 5G SoCs, 120hz displays, 108MP cameras good quality audio speakers and in the case of the Doogee V30; has E-Sim capabilities. Honestly, I am tempted and wishing to be able to buy maybe the Power Armor 18T or the Doogee V30 for the rugged and 5G since my Samsung A71 from 2020 is already showing its age and I think its AMOLED screen is starting to show off wear and tear age and little bits of AMOLED burn.<br><br>Though I guess some of you would say to pick a newer Samsung or more recognized Android for the security and OS updated down the line.

Do you know any other?<br><br>I&#039;m sure that overheating wasn&#039;t the cause because I don&#039;t put the charger under clothes, at the sunlight or anything like that and the charger stops working if the phone is fully charged so no overheating for leaving it connected more time after the phone is fully charged.<br><br>My main theory is that it was some overvoltage problem. For example I used to connect the charger to the socket wall with the phone already connected and I used to see some little spark or a sound when doing it. Apparently it&#039;s better to connect the charger to the wall socket without the phone connected. That is my main theory for why my charger died.

I think I&#039;m sold on it for my needs after a week of using it. the battery is small, but my goal in general with the phone is to use it minimally. I&#039;ve discovered that main battery draws are streaming and surfing. which I&#039;ve realized only really make sense to use a laptop thats plugged in. Consooomers are asking to much from they phones. I&#039;m just gonna start only downloading my podcast stuff and musics on my laptop and transferring them over to my phone every night as needed for the most part.

Took three videos and texted them to my sister. Got back and its still at 91%.

Yes, if you work for a company that uses X language, you should know X language pretty well, but I think that&#039;s secondary to other factors that I think make someone a senior dev. I&#039;ve noticed in my experience senior devs have more knowledge about systems in general - infrastrucutre - terraform, servers, deployment, security, architecture etc and a very good grasp on system design and an ability to quickly learn and understand complex systems. Every senior that I&#039;ve worked with was a pro at terraform, Docker, AWS, Azure, TeamCity etc - all the &quot;secondary&quot; things that aren&#039;t necesarily coding, they understood really well and could solve the complex problems that arose when using these things. Yes, there&#039;s a separate devOps role regardless, but a senior dev I feel like has a realy good grasp at using these things. Currently I&#039;m working at a place that&#039;s very low-latency and high performance, so all the senior devs are experts at linux, mechanical symphany and very knowledgable about memory managment and garbage collection, but before when I was working in a place that used serverless functions, all the seniors were really focused on metrics, docker, terraform and just making sure shit worked. I feel like if you&#039;re confident that you could pretty much do EVERYTHING yourself at work and almost at no point need to ask someone how to do something (unless it&#039;s domain specific knowledge that you&#039;ve never encountered) then you can confidently say you&#039;re a senior. Obviously, this isn&#039;t always a case, but if you feel like you&#039;re closer to that point than to &quot;I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m doing I&#039;m just writing code&quot; you&#039;re either good enough already to be senior or you&#039;re getting there", "filename": "The-risk-I-took-was-calculated-but-man-am-I-bad-at-math", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 554, "h": 390, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674647253484855, "time": 1674647253, "md5": "Hw+1o70mYkPEO76DWkf6Sw==", "fsize": 63300, "resto": 91108709}, {"no": 91110531, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91109075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91109075</a>", "filename": "1668255570115043", "ext": ".png", "w": 533, "h": 676, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674647688794938, "time": 1674647688, "md5": "6ORFQbrIT2n8MjOuwsLGJQ==", "fsize": 257717, "resto": 91108709}, {"no": 91110538, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:55:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If juniors come to you for help regularly you&#039;re a senior developer", "time": 1674647717, "resto": 91108709}, {"no": 91110656, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:07:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I still don&#039;t know what the cutoff is between junior, intermediate, and senior.", "time": 1674648450, "resto": 91108709}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 91108586, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)03:30:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "cai-cli edition<br><br>A general dedicated to discussion &amp;

The first is the risk of scratching up the lenses beyond repair. This happens the moment you have the cleaner running and allow the lenses to touch the walls of the cleaner, or when you have other loose items or hard debris in it. These scratches happen near instantly and pretty much can&#039;t be fixed. The second issue comes from using aggressive cleaning solutions which eat away at coatings, glues or acrylic frames. Mild hand soap is about as harsh you want to go for regular cleaning, diluted blue spirits is what opticians use but should never be used regulary as it will eat away at coatings. But all of this is assuming you&#039;re buying a proper ultrasonic cleaner, and not some bullshit Chinese plastic tub with a N64 rumble pack pressed against it.<br><br>Personally I just use tap water to rinse of dirt and a clean microfiber cloth for my daily cleaning. If that&#039;s not enough I&#039;ll use a Zeiss wet wipe or blue spirits diluted with demineralised water if things are really bad. I need new glasses every 2 to 3 years on average due to my still deteriorating eyesight and cleaning like has never caused me to scuff or scratch up my glasses.

I honestly really like a lot of the non-audio stuff, the form factor is small and comfy, battery life is great, I don&#039;t really have any issues with the UI, and the physical buttons to play/pause/skip are super nice. But then you actually try listening to it, with the Mr Walkman firmware that supposedly makes it sound more &quot;immersive&quot; or some shit like that, and I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s any better than my Abigail dongle. It&#039;s probably worse actually since the sound is colored by snoy&#039;s &quot;region&quot; EQ presets, dynamic range is pretty unimpressive, and as everyone knows the power output is anemic compared to basically anything else. There are a bunch of settings in the custom firmware including the &quot;regions&quot;, &quot;alternate DAC mode&quot;, and &quot;Plus v2&quot;, and I have no fucking clue what any of them are supposed to do, because Mr Walkman doesn&#039;t disclose exactly what they do to the sound and A/B testing to find any difference between any combination of these settings is a pain in the ass since you have to reset the player for changes to take effect. It&#039;s not unlistenable or anything and I can get my IEMs to listenable volumes just fine, but I&#039;m just not into all this firmware modding shit with the mysterious EQ presets. The lack of transparency in the whole experience is annoying and reeks of snake oil, and having less power and more colored sound than a dongle bugs me too.

That&#039;s the nicest way I can say you&#039;re almost completely wrong. You&#039;re criticizing speakers for being imperfect at replicating sound in a space, when headphones are even worse than speakers in this respect in the way people commonly get to use them. Especially people like OP asking questions that aren&#039;t audio enthusiasts.<br><br>Headphones can be the perfect device for simulating spatial sound, but the problem is you need custom HRTFs to do this. Getting HRTFs setup for yourself is one thing but your source must also be designed for HRTF to fully benefit, either recorded for HRTF or a game engine or whatever. But yes if you have HRTF, at worst you can simulate any number and location of speakers you like. I don&#039;t know the state of this is, last time I tried to acquire my own HRTF, it still wasn&#039;t easy. Most people are going to be using no HRTF, or some generic HRTF that spatializes sound only a little bit, and it works better or worse depending on how close your head and ear shape is to the reference. <br><br>Without HRTF, i.e. most of the time we talk about audio. Stereo speakers sound better than headphones for spatial qualities, both in the pleasing qualities of space and localization of sources. 4 speakers is also enough to envelop you in sound if you know where to place them. You should read this if you haven&#039;t already: <br><br>https://we.riseup.net/assets/443799<wbr>/Sound+Reproduction+The+Acoustics+a<wbr>nd+Psychoacoustics+of+Loudspeakers+<wbr>and+Rooms+Floyd+Toole.pdf<br><br>Also some things are going to be limited by the recording.

Besides the obvious points, here&#039;s the big deal:<br><br>Because of the way in which speakers move sound through the air into your ears, if you&#039;re hearing the bass at 60db, the mids and treble will also be at 60db. However, when it comes to headphones (or earphones, IEMs, earbuds, etc.), the close proximity of the drivers to your ear (because of multiple factors) causes differences in perceived volume between different ranges of the frequency spectrum, so manufacturers have to boost bass and treble to make up for that phenomena.<br><br>However, every person&#039;s perceived volume differences when listening to headphones will vary slightly (or even wildly) depending, again, on multiple factors (general genetics, age, eardrum sensitivity and depth inside the dear, outer and innear ear shape, bone and muscle structure around the ear, etc.), so headphone manfuacturers can&#039;t perfectly match everyone&#039;s ears. Instead, they have to do mass studies, and then get the median required difference in bass and treble volume, to get as close as possible to sastisfy most people&#039;s needs. This is also why rich people and musicians get custom molded and tuned IEMs, because then they can actually get a 100% custom frequency response for their specific listening to be neutral.  <br><br>These studies are where target curves come in, like the Harman standard and derivates, which specify a certain level and curve shape for the bast and treble volume boosts that will, objectively, satisfy as many buyers as possible.", "time": 1674595203, "resto": 91050702}, {"no": 91099467, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)16:35:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91099183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91099183</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This is also why rich people and musicians get custom molded and tuned IEMs, because then they can actually get a 100% custom frequency response for their specific listening to be neutral.</span><br><br>Being rich is not a prerequisite here, to be frank.

None of this is an issue when you follow the rule that each binary should do one thing and one thing well, fork and exec of programs with IPC through shared memory and a shared virtual filesystem sorts the need of programs not just loading with 2gb or ram even though that is getting less of an issue with increasing pc power, juicing the machine is all I care about anyway.  A program should take exactly the memory it needs, no less and no more with minimal realloc so that it can run at max speed and do its thing, because a program should be a task, not a monolithic system, that&#039;s what the OS is for, processes are summoned and take the memory they need and then die to be summoned again if you really want to juggle ram.   For my purposes I&#039;m juicing the machine and then some for super computing, I don&#039;t care about some consumer related issue because that&#039;s boring software anyway and even then, all of this vector and RAII shit doesn&#039;t really do much that realloc isn&#039;t perfect at doing, it just protects bad programmers and makes the industry more watered down.  There&#039;s a reason supercomputing uses C.  I&#039;m just into juicing computers for everything I can get for supercomputing, not wage writing some consumer grade bullshit.", "filename": "48afeed31a3e182927c8540b49bee938_w404_h419", "ext": ".png", "w": 404, "h": 419, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674581262614141, "time": 1674581262, "md5": "oER75O5CJc/3+q5fkIUZEA==", "fsize": 232058, "resto": 91083755}, {"no": 91094968, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)12:29:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91083755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91083755</a><br>C is so comfy, I don&#039;t understand all the hate.", "time": 1674581345, "resto": 91083755}, {"no": 91095141, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)12:38:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91093347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91093347</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything else is just C with a locked implementation and a chastity cage on.</span><br>That&#039;s wrong.

But I think there are a few ways you could approach this problem.<br>For example, if you restrict yourself mostly to a single language, you might say the notebook itself just observes some values within your system, and doesn&#039;t act like a part of that (live) system. Then you could just transclude parts of an actual software project into a notebook and use a notebook as a fancy high-level IDE. That could probably then grow further into something like the model you referenced to allow multiple languages.<br>Thanks for the link.

It is surgical, methodical and inhuman. You&#039;ll usually see some nonsense (to you) move that in reality may be just setting up your imminent checkmate a few moves later. Another usual example is the lack of fear or feelings when presented with a move that would make a human have an emotional reaction. For example, perhaps you make a mistake that lets your queen (most powerful piece) be easily captured for free.
