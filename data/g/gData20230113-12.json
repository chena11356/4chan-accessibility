You can totally do a black box audit and you can also put an actual malware into your free and open source app, as most people will just not notice that ( this is what happened with phobos client). Freetards also allways mumble on how someone can fork the project and fix the issues. It is a cool idea in the abstract world, but practically speaking , sometimes it is hard to find such a maintainer (its allways &quot;someone&quot; and its never &quot;me&quot;).<br><br>TL;DR : Stop being linux user (unless you are backend guy), stay on Windows or switch to Mac.", "time": 1673608810, "resto": 90867613}, {"no": 90872739, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:23:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90872067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90872067</a><br>Have you seen the absolute state of western E-girls?", "time": 1673612594, "resto": 90867613}, {"no": 90872749, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)07:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90872739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90872739</a><br>no, i don&#039;t look at them even.", "time": 1673612662, "resto": 90867613}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 90870498, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:32:15", "name": "L Lawliet", "sub": "Linux mint or Ubuntu?", "com": "I want that windows 7/xp feel", "filename": "1672936360922358", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673598735841401, "time": 1673598735, "md5": "SgXXNvNqAqyJ1UYI5r4GXQ==", "fsize": 56030, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "linux-mint-or-ubuntu", "trip": "!!jIcPNMSVBL3", "replies": 21, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 90870532, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:35:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870498</a><br>Linux will never feel like Windows 7/XP in the same way that a tranny&#039;s axe wound will never feel like a vagina.", "time": 1673598939, "resto": 90870498, "since4pass": 2021}, {"no": 90870547, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:37:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870532</a><br>/thread", "time": 1673599059, "resto": 90870498}, {"no": 90870625, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:46:09", "name": "L Lawliet", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870532</a><br>speaking from personal experience, kek?", "time": 1673599569, "resto": 90870498, "trip": "!!jIcPNMSVBL3"}, {"no": 90870661, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:49:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870498</a><br>Mint is closer to the XP/7 feel", "time": 1673599773, "resto": 90870498}, {"no": 90870731, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:55:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870498</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;windows 7/xp feel</span><br>then install 7 or xp wtf", "time": 1673600107, "resto": 90870498}, {"no": 90870751, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:56:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870532</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1673600210, "resto": 90870498}, {"no": 90870766, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870498</a><br>zorin os", "time": 1673600270, "resto": 90870498}, {"no": 90870865, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)04:07:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90870731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90870731</a><br>this, both 7 and XP are very usable daily drivers in 2022.

One way they do that is through contracts. To buy a phone through them, you\u2019ll usually have to sign a two-year or even three-year contract to use their network. And then they\u2019ll hit you with a ridiculous cancellation charge if you try to switch carriers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, what do you do instead? Buy no-contract, gently used phones. These phones are labeled \u201cunlocked\u201d  (meaning you can use them with any carrier) and can take a SIM card.

Postgres also outperforms Mongo in almost all queries. It comes with a set of very useful extensions for which you will not find an equivalent that has a comparable implementation elsewhere (except if it&#039;s a db specialized in solving that exact problem). I am talking about extensions like PostGIS that help with storing geospacial data and TimescaleDB for time-series data.<br><br>There are advantages in using MongoDB thoug. The main point being storing unstructured data. Let&#039;s say you have a usecase where you need to create a table with a dynamic number of columns/labels. In this case using a document data store makes more sense and may be more efficient. Instead of using a table with 120 columns of which 80 will be null most of the time you can use JSONB to store the information you need. However, Postgres does now also act as a document data store with the JSONB Type. However it won&#039;t be as performant for JSON data as Mongo or Cassandra.<br><br>Finally there&#039;s the debate of horizontal scalability. By design, relational databases scale vertically (you add more computing power to your machine instead of creating a cluster of server). NoSQL databases are normally much better at scaling horizontally but Postgres and MySQL have removed most of the obstacles regarding horizontal scalability. As a matter of fact, Facebook, handles billions of requests per second and holds trillions of items according to their estimates, uses MySQL as their database. They have a bit more than 1000 servers running MySQL in a horizontally distributed fashion. Similarly, Instagram does the same with PostgreSQL.

Imagine you have your headphones in but don&#039;t have anything playing, then get a discord ping.  You&#039;ll only hear the last few milliseconds of the tone and will hear popping/clicks/noise as the DAC initializes.

Always slight differences in whole &quot;experience&quot; of having an IEM between them all. Weebs love Coomdrop simple as, and I get it. Aria model (and Snow Edition by extension) is a beloved, renowned set since it&#039;s release and offers a semi-luxe packaging experience at an affordable price. Some people do want metal shell (even if imho it&#039;s inferior to resin, more susceptible to moisture ingress, the paint/chip issues etc). Also the whole new Tinhifi line-up does have somewhat thick nozzles (&gt;6mm diameter) whereas Aria retains a somewhat smaller ~5.5mm.

Arithmetic with prefix notation is also easier to grok once you get used to it.<br>- Python has become very bloated and complex over the years<br>- Clojure uses persistent data structures for everything by default. They eliminate many classes of bugs, and it&#039;s impossible to do functional programming at good speeds without them.<br>- In general, if you want FP but aren&#039;t into Haskell-style type tetris, there is no better option than Clojure.<br>- Clojure has much better support for multi-threading<br>- Scheme is one of the easiest languages to implement yourself, e.g. on an unusual platform or as an extension language in a larger project <br>- Racket is great if you want to create your own domain-specific language <br>- REPL-centric interactive development (I can post some videos if you don&#039;t know what I mean)<br>- Clojure people in particular just make everything they touch more simple and usable. For example .edn is pretty much the best data format there is, and it&#039;s integrated into everything in Clojure; Hiccup syntax is much nicer to write than regular HTML, and so on.<br>- Clojure and Python can use most of each other&#039;s libraries, so Python&#039;s larger ecosystem counts for very little<br>- Python is used by a lot of beginner programmers, so much of the code you find in the wild is of low quality. Clojure is mostly used by experienced Java devs who wanted a simpler and more FP-centric language, and by experienced Lisp programmers who wanted to stop being NEETs.<br>- as a general gripe with C++/Java-style OOP languages, see https://youtube.com/watch?v=aSEQfqN<wbr>YNAc<br>- Main thing I still like about Python is exploratory programming.

I spend less time debugging, less time dealing with scaffolding and build steps, less time searching/reviewing docs and less time doing a mental context switch between languages everyone else uses and the one I&#039;m using.

Also try to make a first aid kit that applies to your situation, your usecases are likely to be different from mine.<br>Stay safe buddy.", "time": 1673389638, "resto": 90822716}, {"no": 90824480, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)17:29:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90824442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824442</a><br>yeah<br>its more i have mental issues so im worried that somethings gonna happen and i wont have something i need<br>i feel like its larping more than not, and if something does happen id just be dead anyway<br>i just sit home 90% of the time", "time": 1673389791, "resto": 90822716}, {"no": 90824671, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)17:43:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90824480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824480</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i feel like its larping more than not, and if something does happen id just be dead anyway</span><br>It&#039;s super easy to go into larping territory especially when prepping and shit, but I feel like there&#039;s a healthy level of security you can build up. I don&#039;t prep myself, but if I was living in a country that was at war I&#039;d probably start creating a bug out bag. My grandparents had to flee war as children and the stories they told about that were horrible. Also affected them for the rest of their lives. If I can alleviate some of the fears etc. for myself by having done my due dilligence, I consider that a plus. <br>A bug out bag doesn&#039;t assume you fight against people attacking you or that you will be a survivalist in the forest, just that you can maybe easily handle 3-5 days outside of home should you need to. <br>In my case the fak is for fishing and hiking as I said, and while the israeli bandage is a bit overkill (Realistically the main advantage of it, being easy and quick to apply, isn&#039;t likely to be vital in the types of injuries you get while fishing or hiking) having a fak is nice. If you have ever been with someone on a hike and they either get the shits or constipated, it&#039;s nice having a pill to give them. I just carry stuff I am likely to use, mostly painkillers, water purification tablets, stuff against too much or too little shitting, disinfectant, disposable gloves, tweezers, plasters, some blister remedies, duct tape, crepe bandage and something against inflammation. Seems to be able to handle most injuries you can get while hiking. If it&#039;s something more serious, I can probably fashion something out of those to delay death until help arrives and if it&#039;s more serious than that, I&#039;ll be dead and won&#039;t have to worry. <br>In your case, a water bottle or two, maybe purification tablets, cash, passport, a spare set of clothes and food for a few days in a backpack might suffice, maybe add a trashbag as a bivy should the need arise.", "time": 1673390588, "resto": 90822716}, {"no": 90824694, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)17:44:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90824480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824480</a><br><a href=\"#p90824671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824671</a><br>And if you do make a fak, remember to look up how to use the stuff (preferably take a course and get some experience, but looking stuff up is at least a substitution, if not a great one).<br>But realistically the further away you are from the front the less likely that this will be your issue.

I guess the belt is meant as a makeshift tourniquet, might be good to have a proper one with you. <br>Other than that, getting a organizer or bag might be a good idea. In my case a normal pouch I put in my backpack is fine, because all wounds likely to happen on a hike are unlikely to kill you quickly, so I have time to pull out a bag, open it and rummage around for the proper items. In your case a molle pouch with decent organization might be a good idea if your backpack is molle compatible. That way you can carry it standalone, or attach it to the outside of your backpack for quick access, or the inside for normal storage/lower profile. <br>And don&#039;t use too small of a pouch, usually makes organization a mess. <br>Also in your case spending some time making your first aid kit retard proof might be good, if against all odds you needed it you&#039;d likely be in shock and have the adrenaline running, so making the steps needed to be thought about minimal is good. In that regard a israeli bandage might actually be good, pretty foolproof to apply. <br>And lastly I guess your mission is striking a balance, preparing for the worst is good, but at some point you reached a &quot;good enough&quot; point and then it might be better if you can ignore/supress the issue and go back to normal life as much as possible for mental health.

You can probably get few thousands of kilometers before running into an issue. But that doesn&#039;t mean flat won&#039;t happen.<br>Yes, flat can be sometimes repaired easy. Easiest is to run slime that will seal the flat. Works great in normal temperature, when it&#039;s too hot or too cold it might not work, but ok. Some scooters even have this goo inside already, that thing is better than slime. <br>Yes, the tire repair rubber thingy also can work. But I wouldn&#039;t call it easy myself, because it&#039;s kinda messy (I would rather just fix bicycle tube since I can do that in 10 minutes) and it&#039;s also not as good seal on scooter tires, but it can work.<br>However you still can get flat on the side of the tire (just on the edge of the thread pattern is enough) and none of the above will work. Or you can mess up the tire repair rubber thingy. Or your valve might get damaged in which case tire needs to go down. Or you can just run the tire down with use. And this is where the nightmare comes. Replacing small tire like this is harder than replacing a tire on a car.<br>I mean, it is possible to repair it, but it&#039;s hard and you should be prepared for that. I do recommend going tubeless, but I&#039;m not going to hide the fact that it&#039;s hard to replace. You should be prepared for it if you decide to go tubeless.<br>When I got first unrepairable flat after 2400km I was one month without my scooter, because with my tools and knowledge I was not able to replace it. I bought proper tools then and eventually I was able to replace it. Even with right tools it&#039;s a pain. Services ask like $150, some even $200 to do it and many won&#039;t do it at all.<br>I know what I&#039;m talking about, I have done the tire replacement couple of dozen times.

Also keep in mind the xiaomi wiha set is not electrically isolated.<br>The stuff you are talking about is all not very demanding, so most sets are probably good for those uses. I&#039;d say focus on it being convenient to use, meaning a good packaging/storing solution. In that regard the xiaomi set is great, but others can be good too. <br>If I were you I&#039;d probably get the wiha set, even if it&#039;s not by wiha it&#039;ll be fine for your usecase most likely. Just don&#039;t get it if static or the lack of isolation is a concern.<br>Alternatively, you can consider one of the ifixit sets, those are a little more specialized for electronics, though less convenient when on the move in my opinion.<br>And if you want to go ultra cheap, look at what is in those ifixit sets and get a generic set on aliexpress that has similar bits. <br><br>The one last thing that is not great with the wiha set is that the handle gets thick a bit too early for my tastes meaning very deeply receded screws in a plastic housing might be hard to reach.

The key knowledge workers in these businesses will surely continue to expect to share financially in the fruits of their labor. But the financial fruits are likely to take much longer to ripen, if they ripen at all. And then, probably within ten years or so, running a business with (short-term) &quot;shareholder value&quot; as its first\u2014if not its only\u2014goal and justification will have become counterproductive. Increasingly, performance in these new knowledge-based industries will come to depend on running the institution so as to attract, hold, and motivate knowledge workers. When this can no longer be done by satisfying knowledge workers&#039; greed, as we are now trying to do, it will have to be done by satisfying their values, and by giving them social recognition and social power.

In a sane world manufacturers would ship headphones with a slip of paper showing their exact frequency response measured on a standardized rig but that would of course show defects, unit variance, and highlight that most headphones have a terrible FR even under ideal circumstances so they&#039;re not interested in doing that. This is coupled with the fact that there is a new measurement standard with an ear simulator and coupler that better represent the human ear so the cost of accurate test rigs have ballooned from about 7k to over 40k. You will be able to buy knockoff versions much cheaper but their accuracy isn&#039;t guaranteed and this is something that you shouldn&#039;t have to do just to confirm your headphones are as good as can be. <br><br>Honestly the more I look at the headphone industry, the more depressing I find it. Enthusiasts are still sticking their head in the sand and arguing about the subjective qualities of bad headphones, most of the time it&#039;s just made up bullshit. If I didn&#039;t hate having shit shoved into my ear canals I would have moved to the IEM world where frequency response actually matters and there is more innovation, but then there is just the reality that most of the differences aren&#039;t actually that impactful so there are diminishing returns. Like if you ever put on a pair of headphones and cried because they sounded that good, it was most likely just placebo effect. I&#039;ve spent some time doing A/B testing and most of the time the differences are so slight that I would have just given up long ago if I wasn&#039;t autistic about loud and accurate bass.", "filename": "HATS-ear-cut-away", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 455, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1673565864133786, "time": 1673565864, "md5": "36+Rh5x0mKQqdYCtQEl9Jw==", "fsize": 169236, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90864958, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)18:55:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what are they like?", "filename": "560s", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1673567735858071, "time": 1673567735, "md5": "MUT5bcgQoc7twiAlioqSiQ==", "fsize": 41497, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90865158, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:12:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90864958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90864958</a><br>see <a href=\"#p90861373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90861373</a>", "time": 1673568723, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90865243, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:18:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90865158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90865158</a><br>fuck", "time": 1673569105, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90865775, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:56:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90864958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90864958</a><br><a href=\"#p90865243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90865243</a><br>Just buy your old m8 the DT 770 PRO", "filename": "1487295158508-IMG_20170203_135837", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 562, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673571407210839, "time": 1673571407, "md5": "tTeWySrhjr4X4JGguyyKOw==", "fsize": 264798, "resto": 90855885}, {"no": 90865986, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)20:10:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90857236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90857236</a><br>They are for relaxing.

The politicians want to look like they&#039;re doing something about it, but don&#039;t understand power generation and distributions along with the associated challenges. Anyone with knowledge in this field keeps telling everyone that beyond a certain penetration of renewables on the grid, the benefits essentially change to detriments. The point at which that transition occurs depends on the region in question; some will do better here and others will do worse. But again, politicians ignore this and earmark huge amounts of money for green energy projects that will ultimately not do enough to fix our issues. The public doesn&#039;t want to hear about the problems because, usually, the people who understand them will say &quot;our best option is nuclear, by a longshot, and we need to build reactors NOW.&quot; and have been saying that for decades. Germany has spent two fucking decades on their Energiewende and are still burning fucking lignite and, up until recently, Russian natural gas. The emperor has no fucking clothes. <br><br>But, you know, keep installing wind turbines and solar panels and eventually the huge and highly technical problems will go away. Just point at another levelized cost of energy study that doesn&#039;t account for battery storage or distribution costs. <br><br>That said, there are people who are actually working on fixing the problems with renewables that never get any recognition or the funding they deserve. Catalyzed reactions with atmospheric carbon dioxide to produce methane are very interesting, but nobody espousing green energy talks about it. It&#039;s a good solution because it allows us to remove carbon from the atmosphere at the same time as it produces fuel that our infrastructure already uses. We can balance carbon to our liking. However, that does raise a new issue in that not everyone will agree on what level of carbon is ideal.

Nukes take the base load, solar needs tons of batteries, and fossils take up the slack (IRL coal plants are not throttleable).<br><br>Problem with zero-carbon energy sources (wind, solar, nuclear) is that they aren&#039;t throttleable. Except hydro, but hydro needs suitable sites usually occupied by villages, national parks, and hiking paths, and protected wetlands downstream. However you need to give energy the point you need it. <br><br>This is where gas-fired plants come in, because they are turbines and throttleable. But you need gas to run them, which comes from le ebil dictatorships, and produces pollution.<br><br>So you need to regulate the grid. You can do this in a centralized way (pumped hydro, hydrogen generation and hydrogen turbines/fuel cells, lolhuge batteries including exotic chemistries like vanadium, molten salt solar), or a decentralized way (subsidize homes to install enough batteries for 24 hours of their demand, and provide them with electricity whenever there&#039;s an excess on the grid).<br><br>You also have loads which needs to run at full blast 24/7 (server farms), and that&#039;s where nuclear comes in (nuclear is not throttleable, so it needs to run at 100% constantly).<br><br>Problem with boiling water is that when steam has gone through the turbines, it&#039;s at 100-ish degC and low pressure, and you need to condense it, so remove a lot of heat. You can produce cooling from that kind of steam with adsorption refrigerators. You also need to use electricity to heat and cool buildings and make hot water. If there was some way you could connect these two, like the district heating systems in 1970&#039;s COCOM block, or early 1900&#039;s new york steam system?

I have a attached a massive image that I believe proves this. All sections, (Tavern, Kobold, KoboldUI2, and Piggy Notebook) Were all using the same prompt, same settings, and the same model. Yet the results were drastically different. The prompt was extremely simple; <br>&quot;Emma is a cute girl<br> Emma&#039;s favorite color is medium-brownish-orange.&quot;<br>Yes, really that&#039;s it. This image shows that Pygmalion&#039;s notebook is by far the weakest in responding, it doesn&#039;t seem to even read the description of the character at all. The most intriguing thing to me was that all the platforms were different, Tavern was pretty dry in its response, UI2 and Piggy Notebook just got it wrong, and Kobold acted how I&#039;d expect the model to act.<br>What does this mean for users? Well it proves one thing    undoubtedly Pygmalion is a work in progress model. Major issues like this need time to surface, I only thought about testing due to the name bias, and other anon&#039;s reporting memory issues. I am on Tavern and haven&#039;t been experiencing these issues. This explains why.

Sometimes I would argue, 10k hours is the bare minimum at being an amateur. 4 years of 8 hours a day is nothing compared to a real &quot;master&quot; who put in 30+ years of 8+ hours a day.

The point was that back in the day the Internet was its own community and treated differently by society with different rules ,mores and the like.   Until Facebook came along (and others like Google+ basically doubled down) it was considered anathema to give out your real name and  meatspace identity on the Internet.  Even parents who knew relatively little of tech save for email and their kids had PCs told them &quot;Never tell anyone your real identity&quot;  in casual online discourse.   In fact it was a MAJOR event if you trusted someone enough  to eventually meet up with them in real life- always in a public place and usually bringing a friend or family member to look out for you. You certainly didn&#039;t; use your real ID, a picture etc... for just various shitposting like would be common on Facebook , Twitter and the like.    <br><br>What&#039;s more is that stuff that happened on the Internet was seen to be different from the &quot;real world&quot; for better or worse.  This is why people  could talk about their sexuality or their nerdy hobbies or whatever the fuck else online anonymously and people understood a disconnect between people being a jerks online and the real world.  Didn&#039;t like it? Leave the site, change game servers, go offline etc.. and it wouldn&#039;t follow you any farther nor would you go out of your way to do  so. Sure there were a handful of hacking/stalker shit but it was both a lot more difficult in some ways and there was less info, plus those in general society wouldnt believe or give a shit if some wacko from the internet claimed that person X was very problematic or something.     <br><br> Social media undid all this exclusively for profit, mixed with the data mining and advertising/search companies and made it normal to operate with meatspace identity, not to mention the lack of updated privacy laws- still stuck in the 80s/90s - meant that all those people search sites and all the other garbage is even worse.

What you guys are referring to as GNU HURD, is in fact, GNU/GNU HURD, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus GNU HURD. GNU HURD is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Dozens of computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is narrowly used today is often called &quot;GNU HURD&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a GNU HURD, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. GNU HURD is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#039;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. GNU HURD is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with GNU HURD added, or GNU/GNU HURD. All the so-called &quot;GNU HURD&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/GNU HURD.

Even without changing the representation of a program as text there are many improvements to be had.
