What do I mean when I say dynamism?<br>Moar bass, moar treble, it means the cone/diaphragm actually move back and forth at more distance and also move tiny back and forth at less and very quick distance (high pitch). The problem is deeper diaphragm movement means slower bass perceived in music while the quick back and forths for higher freq tend to appear faster.<br><br>Earphones that have really light cone/diaphragm usually they are carbon fiber (plastic) &quot;aka light carbon diaphragm&quot; dont typically burst like all these &quot;airline free earphones&quot; which use plain plastic or maybe they died from all that cleaning and uv they did (some airlines may actually recycle them).<br><br>Raycons shouldn&#039;t really have bad tuning since sound depends on how you wear them and the wearer. Earphones like these that are too bassy are not bassy to some people.<br>As someone whose ears appear to be parallel to my sides, I never really get midbloat on basshead-tuned iems that graph like bloat. Maybe it&#039;s actually why bassheads prefer basshead tuning, our ears may just be too pulled towards the back that it doesn&#039;t &quot;cup&quot; around the earphone&#039;s tips. It does get midbloat if I push the tips further deep in but I don&#039;t like doing that cause it&#039;s gay and I don&#039;t use flatbass cringe like etymotic.<br><br>I suggest you just get the same shit if you&#039;re used to it or grab the same earphone with the same FR.

If you&#039;re less lucky it might have a fake bridge mode, where it continues to do its own DHCP with your ISP, but just then reassigns whatever it gets to its client (your own router) and does nothing else. This intermediate DHCP handshake interferes with a few things but for normie purposes itll be fine. if you&#039;re unlucky, it won&#039;t have bridge mode and you have to do double NAT.

The way most of these things work is that the model basically has a shitload of numbers associated to it that influence how it works. These numbers may be actually randomly initialized. In the training process you give the model a certain input and then evaluate how close its output is to what you want it to do.

Firstly the volume of rarepads sold isn&#039;t really enough to create a decent price database and you can&#039;t use prices that are old since the market changes. This is aggravated by the fact that quite a few of those that are sold go through private sales or trades since many are in the hands of collectors who tend to not do public auctions.<br>And that&#039;s not getting into the fact that certain models are more common on foreign markets such as yahoo auctions (240, pc110 etc.) or the Singapore market (S30/31 with Eng keyboard) and the price there would be different from eBay.<br>Secondly the price guide is created with the general public in mind whereas with rarepad since your getting into what is pretty much a collectors market more details matter. A sticker might not change the price much on a X230 but would matter for your models. I&#039;ve seen someone pay a premium because a model had the original IBM background on the desktop screen.<br>Thirdly i don&#039;t really see who&#039;d benefit from such a guide.

You fell for the biggest piece of audiophile bullshit in the world, that you&#039;re paying more money for better sound quality instead of the resulting placebo effect. You cannot tell me why the HD800S sounds better than any other headphones without it being nonquantifiable audiophile hocus pocus because all evidence points to frequency response being pretty much everything and there it doesn&#039;t standout. There is a near zero percent chance you could pick out the $2,000 ADI-2 from a cheap amp, or even a cheap motherboard with relatively low distortion, in blind testing. Nor could you pick out the $59,000 HE-1 from $150 headphones painstakingly EQed to sound the same to your ear, or vice versa because that works too.  <br><br>The most egregious flaws in FR are still pretty subtle. Research will tell us that mostly everyone will prefer one target over another target when listening to certain songs but it doesn&#039;t tell us if the difference is meaningful or if you would actually care either way. Even if we found a target that is 100% objectively correct and somehow works for everyone despite head-related transfer function it wouldn&#039;t sound that impressive during blind testing. It wouldn&#039;t change the biggest problem in the industry, which is that nothing mixed correctly because room size, shape, and treatment creates more variability than what is found between any two good speakers. This hobby sucks because no one wants to accept a harsh reality that would invalidate all their feelings and make them feel ashamed, they seek a religious experience that nothing can give them so instead they just pay more money and stick their head in the sand.

For every character, I could easily think up real life people I knew who acted the same way.<br>#2 The main character embodies many of the real-life traits of the INTP personality, a rather rare personality type that is almost never properly depicted in media. This causes INTPs (who happen to cluster on the internet and possess autism) to impress themselves upon her. Her mental illness also gets her brownie points.<br>#3 The story is absolutely steeped in philosophy, the occult, and other deeper ideas, making sure every character and scene possess some deeper meaning to it. This not only pulls the deeper thinking INTPs even deeper into the story, but also impresses the average viewer due to the accuracy of the predictions that the ideas managed to create.<br>#4 The atmosphere of the show is masterful. It manages to both speak to some on a spiritual level, and creep others out enough to make them consider it a psychological thriller. From the soundtrack to the animation to the voice acting, the show is a masterpiece in reaching out and touching your psyche.<br>#5 The duality of Lain in the game and lain in the show.

The Elvis impersonator said no but then had something strange to say: &quot;You should watch your back,&quot; he warned George solemnly before continuing on with what seemed like some sort of prophetic message about how one&#039;s fate can change suddenly without warning or explanation - much like how it happened to pop star Michael Jackson years ago when tragedy struck unexpectedly during one of his concerts despite all the safety precautions taken beforehand.. <br><br>The next week, news broke that Minneapolis Police Department officers had killed an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while arresting him for allegedly using counterfeit money at a convenience store - this same man being none other than the very person whom this mysterious Elvis Impersonator had warned only days prior!

The style influence is obvious, with the bright blocks of color, childish patterns, and oversized geometric shapes. Bertrand Pellegrin described Memphis design as &quot;a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price&quot; in the San Francisco Chronicle.<br><br>The style rejected the idea of &quot;good taste&quot; and made purposefully flashy and impractical furniture. You might recognize its influence in the design of Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse or the 1989 show Saved by the Bell. Even David Bowie was a fan. Like the illustration style that took its name, Memphis was criticized during its time for glorifying conspicuous consumption and being a sign of tasteless consumerism.<br><br>In the 1988 movie Beetlejuice, self-involved artist Delia Deetz antagonizes the main characters post-mortem by stripping their home of its quaint charm and replacing it with tacky Memphis design. The result is iconic. Memphis is also used in 1987\u2019e Wall Street te showcase stockbroker Bud\u2019s tasteless corporate wealth.<br><br>Despite the criticism at the time, Memphis came to define the 80s aesthetic. While designers today nostalgically look to the 80s for inspiration, Memphis Group members were also influenced by earlier movements. Their design took cues from the curved lines and bold geometry of the 1920s Art Deco movement, the colorful futurism of 1950s atomic-age interior design, and the bright colors and bold patterns of the 1960s Pop Art movement.<br><br>In the mid-century era, commercial illustration bloomed as an art form, using a modernist approach to form and color to create spectacular mass-produced images. The Modernist art movement at the end of the 19th century had moved art away from realism.

All the faders are pretty much the same length/size/color and they&#039;re fucking everywhere.

Random note path<br>    Creates the path of the melody for a scale (or subset). So if you choose c major pendatic scale, and roll 2 4 5 1, you make a meldoy that goes D F G C.<br>2. Random progression<br>   Create a random progression, or more interesting, roll for what note that the melody will use from the progression. So if I have C F Dm G, I would roll 1, 3, 2, 3. With this, I use the 1, 3, 2 and 3 degrees of each chord, making a meldoy that goes C, A, F, D.<br>3. Polymeter<br>   Generate the ratio between two sounds.  So if I get 4/6, I make a polymeter out of that<br>4. Energy Level/dynamics<br>   Decide what the energy level for a section could be. It&#039;s interpretive, so just go by 1-5, and get an idea of what it means<br>5. Syncopatction<br>   You could roll a die to see which beats gets accented and which don&#039;t.  <br>6.

Just look at image AIs. Every faggot said artists would be the ones using it the most and it would catapult their work forward. Instead no artist uses it because they can already do anything the AI does, they have more fun without AI art, and using it to outcompete other artists also does not work because it is accessible to every pleb and just allows the plebs to ignore the artists. Prompter is not a real job and won\u2019t be because of this. I even started PromptThread on /d/ where experienced promoters would do requests, but nobody came.
