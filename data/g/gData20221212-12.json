The Arias sound great with the stock cable and the memoy foam tips. However, the Kinera Gramr is recessed by a few mm on the right side, but by almost nothing on the left side. As a result, they keep falling out of the left side of the Arias, the side with the mic boom arm. What the fuck is the point of this? If the 2-pin connector is recessed on one, why wouldn&#039;t it be on the other? There was even a reviewer on youtube who tried the cable out with a bunch of IEMs and claimed it was compatible with the Arias, but I&#039;m pretty sure he must have tested just the recessed connector. <br><br>Not sure what to do now, I can&#039;t be bothered to return them and potentially wait 2 months for them to be received and another 2 months to get something compatible.

People love those atmospheric playlists also - so if they aren&#039;t listening to a podcast or music, they are still bombarding their senses with more ear candy. I am critical of it, because I found myself becoming like those people not too long ago, I was constantly listening to something, even if I was talking to people irl. Basically, I went the other direction and started looking into monks and people that do ascetic practices. In Catholicism there is a heavy focus on self-denial and silent contemplation. I used that stuff as motivation to be silent for a certain amount of time each day, go to bed without anything playing, reading books without ambient music, being more present when talking to people irl. Honestly, I feel so much better. It is a real addiction that does beat your senses down and your ability to concentrate if you let it, you may think you are unaffected, but try doing a bit of a detox from constant noise and you will be amazed by the changes in your energy and mood.
