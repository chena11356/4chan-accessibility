I&#039;m trying to find Spanish language audio movies and TV shows, as in stuff that was originally in Spanish as opposed to dubs, with Spanish subtitles. It doesn&#039;t matter if they are SHD subs or just regular. I&#039;m an English speaker who is far enough along in learning Spanish that I can watch stuff with Spanish audio and Spanish subs to read along; not advanced enough to just listen to the audio alone and probably won&#039;t be for years.<br><br>A lot of the movies on PTP or shows on BTN that are from Spanish speaking countries tend to not have the Spanish subs. I&#039;m not sure if they were ripped or never available in the first place. A lot of the discs I rent from Netflix to rip have the Spanish subs present, but many don&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping that Spanish trackers might have people ripping them from releases in Spanish speaking countries, which would be more likely to have Spanish subs. Finding them on external subtitle sites is very hit or miss, as is the quality of the translations.<br><br>I know as hard as HD Spain is to get into I&#039;d have to be mayor of Madrid for at least a few years before I got an invite, but does anyone have any other leads? I recently joined Lat-Team and it&#039;s lacking in the content area. I&#039;m down to contribute to build it up, but of the few times it has what I&#039;m looking for, Spanish subs aren&#039;t present.

A shopping bag that folds down quite small so I can always carry it in my jacket and forget about it - $1.47, paid $1.29<br>Would have preferred if the bag and the outer shell were connected, everything else seems fine. Seams don&#039;t look ass, but not enforced or anything either. Should last for a while if you take proper care, but it&#039;ll eventually break.

Great to have in your jacket though, for the times I don&#039;t have my opinel with me. <br>3. Melamine sponges - $5.31, paid $4.58 for 100<br>Ran out of my old ones, these are new ones. They work just as well as any other one, which means they work great. <br>4. Folding fork, spoon and two screw on chopsticks - paid $3.66<br>These are amazing. Feel high quality, the locking mechanism works great, time will tell how well they hold up/how good the stainless is. They come with a nice little bag to carry them in, very happy, especially for the price.<br>5.

Materials are what you&#039;d expect, seams seem fine. Pleasantly surprised by the organizational options. Will make finding the right thing when it&#039;s dark much easier. A bit big for what I need it to hold, but I will find use for the space, might just turn one compartment into FAK and use one for maps and navigational stuff.<br>6.

One warning, I put it on a laptop recently and it couldn&#039;t boot due to issues with the TPM and GRUB. I hadn&#039;t used a laptop new enough to run into that before. The fix was replacing GRUB with systemd-boot (or adding rmmod tpm to GRUB boot options, but couldn&#039;t figure out how to make that change permanent), and someone in the IRC was able to help. Not sure *why* that fixed it, and I generally don&#039;t like systemd, but it is what it is.", "time": 1671000833, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90287935, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90286306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90286306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he settles for photographs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t have a vast animal webm collection</span>", "filename": "bros", "ext": ".webm", "w": 720, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671002105459651, "time": 1671002105, "md5": "hfQTGEqFMq46JqLM4HbAgA==", "fsize": 3113611, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90287950, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90282397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90282397</a><br>thinkpads support linux well, anon. try a different distro.", "time": 1671002223, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90288195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:39:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90287935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90287935</a><br>Saved a few from /an/", "filename": "1617537673057", "ext": ".webm", "w": 576, "h": 720, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671003548310993, "time": 1671003548, "md5": "qszkyZsuttOUujQ8zp27oQ==", "fsize": 2824012, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90288294, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:48:25", "name": "asukafag", "com": "<a href=\"#p90286856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90286856</a><br>irrelevant. i don&#039;t get distracted by looking at homosexuals because i am not a homosexual. when you&#039;re doing a job, theres a thing called professionalism, and seeing a gay rainbow, or hell even an erect throbbing cock on your task bar shouldn&#039;t distract you from the task at hand unless you have what they now call ADD/ADHD but when i have always called a lack of discipline.<br><br>if you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t use it, but when you wonder why your plastic screwdriver isn&#039;t as good at hammering in nails as my flamboyantly gay hammer, just remember what I told you - you&#039;re better off with a biro and a stack of post-it notes than a computer since you don&#039;t do anything of import on it anyway.<br>i&#039;ve earned the right to use my computer to shitpost because this hunk of metal makes me money.", "filename": "1661529954617984 100452014_p0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2885, "h": 2811, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1671004105857983, "time": 1671004105, "md5": "HtGlkdkEqiAKRO6jl3HSbw==", "fsize": 2238288, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90288339, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:52:13", "name": "sage", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;90288243</span><br>nobody gives a fuck", "time": 1671004333, "resto": 90282358}, {"no": 90288367, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:55:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90288195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90288195</a><br>I&#039;ve got quite a few.

Spend 4 hours masturbating yesterday. From about 8am to 12:30 pm. Watched some 30 vid clips on redtube.<br><br>Usually, when i masturbate, i hold it from cuming. So, ejaculation happens only after few hours. After initial ejaculation, sometimes i wait for 10 min and ejaculate again. (i think the record might be 4 ejacs in a masturbation session) Been like that for most past 20 years. Not sure why i developed it. I think its from a mentality of wanting to be good in bed, in the same way a young man want to have muscles or wants to be a kungfu master.<br><br>coupled with my ascetic and calculating propensity, so the holding became somewhat like a practice of meditation, as the way monks go about doing things.<br><br>just to be complete or for the record\u2026 i first masturbated when i was i think 11 or 12. I was in bed, sleeping. \u0399 don&#039;t remember the details, but took a plastic bag and ejaculated into it (so i don&#039;t wet the bed). It&#039;s the first real masturbation. I was excited, agitated, nervous, and also somewhat fear of being caught. It was also much wonder \u2014 I did not know what is going on. \u0399 guess most kids of that age felt the same.", "time": 1671015147, "resto": 90288423}, {"no": 90290127, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:54:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90290101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90290101</a>", "filename": "k", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 593, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671015273332511, "time": 1671015273, "md5": "5rTOXuskt2hDI8YFbmEiWw==", "fsize": 173281, "resto": 90288423}, {"no": 90290144, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:56:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90290127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90290127</a><br>A Close Encounter with a Prostitute in Las Vegas<br>By Xah Lee. Date: 2003-12-30<br>Nevada is infamous for legalized prostitution. One of a kind in respect to the entire country USA. While at Vegas, i thought of hooking up with a hooker. I want to get a blowjob, and want to carry a girl, and other less speakable things. Along The Strip at night, little cards are handed out to pedestrians. These cards have star-nippled girls and phone numbers printed on them. They seem to be advertisement for prostitutes. After some research, it seems that the ladies and phone numbers on the card only offer erotic dances sort of thing, and that prostitution is actually not legal in Clark County, where Las Vegas is in. This is a dubious fact, and probably not strictly enforced. I mean c&#039;mon, people came from all over the world to Vegas for the sin, and fornication is a grandest sin. It is not likely that magnates or vacationers staying in lush Vegas hotels surrounded by skin shows couldn&#039;t get a commercial lay. Though, it is true that one don&#039;t see pimps or harlots soliciting tourists along The Strip, nor brothels to be seen in the city. It makes sense. Tourists offended by prostitution won&#039;t spoil their vacation by harlots strutting their stuff on the street, while sex seekers can easily find their trading partner unobstructed by rules of conduct of the community.
