One approach could be to use multiple maps, each representing a different angle or perspective, and then have the game switch between these maps as the player rotates the camera.<br><br>Another approach could be using a technique called &quot;hexagonal grid&quot; which is a type of grid that uses hexagons instead of squares to represent the map.

They would have to create Windows software that has GNU/Linux exploits embedded in it for the sole purpose of targetting anyone running it through wine.<br>And on top of that do they target wine or proton? Which distro do they target? And even among users of the same distro our systems are highly varied with totally different combinations of desktop software, window managers, startup systems, etc.<br>So whatever exploit they use is going to have a tiny surface area (i.e. a tiny amount of users that are vulnerable to their very specific attack) that it&#039;s not even worth the effort, and has a low probability of working on your specific machine anyway.<br><br>Also GNU/Linux is inherently more secure than windows. Software is installed as root but run as a non-root user, so software can&#039;t even modify itself.<br>Our software is not normally bundled like it is on windows, and that means the libraries are actually &quot;shared&quot; between a lot of software like it&#039;s intended to be and upgrading that library simultaneously upgrades all software on the system.<br>So you almost never have random outdated libs lying around from old software on your system, which is the cause of probably &gt;90% of windows vulnerabilities.<br><br>So as long as you use the package manager to install your software you&#039;re pretty damn safe. Unless the repo itself is compromised, but if you&#039;re that paranoid there are ultra-autistic distros that can protect you from even your own package maintainers if you want to put in the effort.<br><br>The biggest vulnerability on GNU/Linux is 3rd party software you download outside the repo, like Steam games for example.

Obviously you&#039;re sol if you want to use the normal stack(though it MAY be possible to do some wizardry, I&#039;m not hopeful for a magical open source html rendering engine anytime soon), so instead you use something else, probably sexps, maybe byte compile and compressed. Now you&#039;ve basically reinvented HTML+CSS+JS. Did you do a better job? Maybe. And then you&#039;ve got to network all this, and it&#039;s obviously going to have to be p2p since lets face it, it&#039;ll never be popular enough for a server ecosystem to make sense. Best way to do that is a DHT, maybe a skipgraph, you&#039;ve now reinvented DNS, but much slower and more complicated since it needs to run on normal machines and not optically accelerated ASICs.<br>Lets say you finish it, you&#039;ve got your perfect networked searchable all lisp ecosystem you can hook into from any computer anywhere in the world. How do you run programs not written in lisp?

You use these tools and uncomment text in a config file to make doom do what you want. The moment you want to add some elisp you found somewhere to make your emacs work a certain way, doom will start fighting you. <br>A starter pack like prelude is a better choice. It&#039;s just regular elisp the way you would write it as a normal user. It&#039;s a bit much to look at at first because unlike doom where you just modify the one config file, prelude&#039;s config is broken into multiple files. Prelude is also a nice choice if you want to roll your own config. The way it&#039;s broken into multiple files in lisp/ directory that are (require)&#039;d in init.el is likely the same strategy you&#039;d eventually land on if you roll your own config.<br>Prelude (or any other small starter pack) + a pdf of mastering emacs will be the most effective onboarding and it&#039;s not gonna leave you with wasted project-specific knowledge specific like doom / spacemacs.<br>Finally I&#039;d like to add that in general the more you get to know emacs the less you will actually want in your init.

Then, when that is evaluated, what do we get?<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">&#039;(function argument) =&gt; (function argument)<br></pre><br>That&#039;s right, if you evaluate a quoted expression, you get back the literal form. No errors or undefined variables.<br>Of course, that&#039;s not very useful because we don&#039;t care about &quot;function&quot; or &quot;argument&quot;, we want what those values are going to stand for, thus:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">`(,function ,argument) =&gt; ([function] [argument])<br></pre><br>By &quot;unquoting&quot; the two variables we are telling the macro expander to replace them with whatever those values are *eventually*  going to be, but we don&#039;t care about them right now.<br><br>After the whole expansion ordeal is finished, the result replaces your macro call. This is the reason why we want a macro to return a quoted form, and not the actual result like functions do. So:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(print &quot;Hello World&quot;)<br>(my-macro function argument)<br>(+ 1 1)<br></pre><br>Would simply become:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(print &quot;Hello World&quot;)<br>(function argument)<br>(+ 1 1)<br></pre><br><br>And finally comes the second stage, where the expanded result of your macro is once again evaluated, but this time together with all the rest of your program, as if it had been there all along.", "time": 1674002944, "resto": 90903081}, {"no": 90956273, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90928867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90928867</a><br>The only reason to change is upgrade anxiety.

Those are Genelec 8020s. The 8010s are not an option imho and yes they work well as desktop speakers. Since I am depressed I do not record any music lately and they are very nice for listening. Yo will miss some deep bass without a subwoofer but I do not care since I have a bigger setup in the living room. If you want a good nearfiled experience for &quot;cheap&quot; get some KH120s or the 8030s, install REW and get some calibrated microphone.<br>AKG 701s are alright but the goat would be Sennheiser HD600s. Do not believe audiofools who say there is a dynamic headphone that is way better than that. I do not really listen to music with headphones so I did not buy a pair of hd600s again. I head the pleasure to listen to a lot of &quot;highend&quot; headphones in my life and it is just too much snakeoil.

It is in our DNA. Sure, there is no &#039;one size fits all&#039; or silver bullet and some are just boilerplate solutions, leveraged to the hilt and really only keeping us at a 30,000-foot-view of things. Being on-site, however, really allows us to get better granularity, find better directional-indicators, or loop back and dive deep into some critical issues on a go-forward basis.<br><br>I think if you all start spending more time in the office again, you&#039;ll find yourself trending toward the positive, but you&#039;ll have to keep an eye on the puck.

I&#039;ll put my layman&#039;s hat on and guess that it comes from movies such as Office Space and Dilbert cartoons.

So, just one more point that I want to cover-off on: let&#039;s socialize the idea of having more office presence and loop back to see whether we&#039;re being more impactful. From a management standpoint, I think that we can get the traction to do it.<br><br>So, net/net, ignore the naysayers, sidebar the folks that are stuck in the weeds, and don&#039;t waste cycles or bandwidth on folks that don&#039;t align strongly with this mission.
