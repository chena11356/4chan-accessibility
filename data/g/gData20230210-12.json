The most fragile part is the one near the plug, that&#039;s what you must maintain straight.<br><br>I used to have an iPhone and the plastic they use for the charging cable is the biggest shit in the planet. Is one of the best examples of planned obsolescence. The charging cable that came with the phone died after like 2 or 3 years because the plastic literally disintegrated. I tried using adhesive tape to prolong it&#039;s life but eventually the cable was all wrapped in tape and it was disgusting and I had to keep putting more tape because it falls off with time. I bought a new charging cable (an Apple one), only the cable was like 20 fucking euros, a simple USB cable. And it happened the same than with the first cable, the plastic disintegrated in 2 or 3 years. Then I bought a cable of another brand and it lasted forever without the plastic to brake. Why?, simple: BECAUSE THEY USE A NORMAL PLASTIC THAT IS DURABLE ENOUGH, NOT THE SHIT THAT APPLE USES THAT IS MADE ON PURPOSE TO BREAK EACH 2 OR 3 YEARS SO YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM 20\u20ac EVERY 2 YEARS.<br><br>Having an Apple phone is advertised as &quot;a social status&quot;... like 90% of people that buy Apple phones use them for simple things and they don&#039;t need a phone so powerful. Imagine paying 1000$+ for a phone to then use it for YouTube, WhatsApp, listening to music and little more. And then your charging cable is pure shit and is planned to brake every X years and any accessory you buy is the most expensive from all the brands. Samsung accessories are also becoming expensive but Apple is still more expensive.

Right on startup, before the main menu, the game presents you a &quot;compiling shaders&quot; screen that lasts for three to five minutes. Unfortunately the shaders that get compiled at this time are only the most essential ones. As you progress through the game you&#039;ll encounter serious drops in framerate (to unplayable levels) for about 30 seconds. Just stop and wait for the shader compiler to finish\u2014this breaks the immersion of course and I wonder if this can&#039;t be solved more elegantly. I investigated a bit further and the game is compiling shaders in the background even during normal stutter-free gameplay, too, without affecting the game much. We&#039;ve seen such problems in many games recently and I keep hearing how these will get fixed in the &quot;day one&quot; patch, &quot;soon&quot; after launch, maybe with the next big patch, or with the next DLC. For nearly all games these issues never get fixed, and there&#039;s never any noteworthy performance improvements, so /doubt. My recommendation is to just live with it, stop playing for a few seconds when you get hit by the stutter, take a short break, and resume when things are smooth again. Just to clarify, for 98% of my play time in the first few hours there was no stutter and no frame drop issues, everything was super smooth.<br><br>AYYMDEADUNBOX is retarded, the stuttering is because of shader compilation<br><br>You thought descendants of criminals know technology?

He started using every single shitty pseudominimalist, ncurses-based program, used a shitty riced out i3 setup of dubious actual productivity (like all tiling wms), then fell for the full Suckless meme and went in even deeper. Then he started making videos shitting on Python and praising C, which is ironic considering he is not even a programmer by his own admission. He effectively spent years trying out, configuring and hopelessly trying to integrate tens of meme programs to build what is, combined, effectively a shittier Emacs, just like most of /g/ was doing in their &quot;productive&quot; desktop threads a year or two ago. Then he read the Unabomber manifesto and blindly accepted it without constructively analyzing it first, same with the anarcho-primitivist ideology that was all the rage about a year and a half on 4chan and 8ch. While he stated on his website that he &quot;didn&#039;t browse 4chan much anymore&quot; it was obvious this wasn&#039;t the case. Then he went and took the memes way too far, and unironically went to live in isolation. While I see nothing wrong in itself, the actual reason he did it is massive cringe. He has the mentality of someone 10 years younger than he is, yet he acts like a literal boomer jokingly criticizing &quot;zoomers&quot; despite he himself being the worst example of a millennial. He attacks &quot;nerds&quot; when it&#039;t painfully obvious he&#039;s deeply unhappy with himself, as it was obviously self-directed criticism thinly veiled as an edgy dabbing video.

That&#039;s not a secure platform and from my experience in dealing with medical records data, most Dr offices are avoiding using email due to HIPAA regulations and security risks. Only talk to a medical office over the phone or in person, even if they offer communication over email. Same goes for text, nothing over SMS. <br>My opinion on username for personal email address, is the same system I&#039;ve always recommended in this thread and others on /g/, take your initials and convert to hexadecimal. In most cases you&#039;ll have a unique 6 character alphanumeric name that no one else has already taken (unless it&#039;s Gmail which you shouldn&#039;t use to begin with). <br>The reason why I&#039;m saying don&#039;t use PII in email is because even if it&#039;s just for &quot;normie&quot; stuff, it don&#039;t matter. You don&#039;t have control over the email once it leaves your inbox, and if someone you&#039;re communicating with gets hacked or beached, then it&#039;s out in the open that is your email much easier because it will have your full name as the handle (which is just metadata not even the data itself), and bonus retard points for people who put their birthday in the handle. Seriously, with just those data points, name and birthday, someone could easily do harm to you and even find your SSN matched to that on the dark web and start opening credit in your name.

The way it works though is that you receive money (say, a paycheque) and you &quot;spend it&quot; by moving all of that money to the different categories.<br>The psychological effect is real. In your head you don&#039;t have any money, it&#039;s already spent. Likewise, it isn&#039;t depressing to pay bills or whatever you have to because it&#039;s as if you have already paid that money out - it&#039;s already gone from your perspective.<br>Anyway, it changed my life. For the first time ever I have savings, I have an emergency fund, and I&#039;m saving money to buy a house with my wife.

By combining two types of discrete speech representations, we cast TTS as a composition of two sequence-to-sequence tasks: from text to high-level semantic tokens (akin to &quot;reading&quot;) and from semantic tokens to low-level acoustic tokens (&quot;speaking&quot;). Decoupling these two tasks enables training of the &quot;speaking&quot; module using abundant audio-only data, and unlocks the highly efficient combination of pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for parallel data when training the &quot;reading&quot; component. To control the speaker identity, we adopt example prompting, which allows SPEAR-TTS to generalize to unseen speakers using only a short sample of 3 seconds, without any explicit speaker representation or speaker-id labels. Our experiments demonstrate that SPEAR-TTS achieves a character error rate that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods using only 15 minutes of parallel data, while matching ground-truth speech in terms of naturalness and acoustic quality, as measured in subjective tests.", "time": 1675870972, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91410780, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:44:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410706</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP is entirely tortoise</span><br>Retard", "time": 1675871046, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91410854, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410780</a><br>Hey it is one of many options.", "time": 1675871413, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91411060, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:02:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410682</a><br>Great bake OP, better than the shill split attempt thread, they won&#039;t stop and have to ruin it for everyone.<br><a href=\"#p91410780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410780</a><br>so that&#039;s the shill game plan this time, try to subvert anons away from tortoise, got it.

Dataset<br>Currently code expect dataset to be in form of image jpg,jpeg,webp,png and accompanying json file that contains tags i.e danbooru dataset. Currently it&#039;s hardcoded and will be used as example one for that guide.<br>Sqlite db is stored in repo as index of files, and files served from linode bucket in pairs, there is check in code to discard non paired images. During training, both image and json are fetched, and from json extracted only description tags and saved as txt file alongside image in workplace directory.<br>2. Mother node<br>Currently it expects to have GPU and will be part of the swarm. For distributed training you also need configuration in next step.<br>3. Relay mode<br>Next step is to set up relay configuration in UI, that will allow your node to serve config endpoint to peers - from wich they will be able to grab config, for that purprose I.E port are used. So if you behind NAT it makes sense to portforward port 80 to your internal I.E port, TCP ports are used for DHT connections so as well needed to be portforwarded, and your public ip will be used as DHT server, so that ip (or domain name ) you can spread among peers so they would be able to join swarm.<br>If you are NOT behind NAT, put matching pairs of ports here, so advertised and listened ports are matched and that will do the trick.<br>4. Training<br>After configuration and start of training, there will be main events after 1200 seconds i.e 20 minutes<br>Optimizer and Averager events should start and peers will exchange trained weights - that should lead to decrease in loss.<br>Due to geography and network speeds, and size of weights that part may be tricky so keep an eye on that.<br>5.

In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one-to-many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms. A subjective human evaluation (mean opinion score, or MOS) on the LJ Speech, a single speaker dataset, shows that our method outperforms the best publicly available TTS systems and achieves a MOS comparable to ground truth.", "time": 1675900168, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91418895, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)18:54:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I may be stupid but I can&#039;t get the turtle to output anything remotely good.

But, OLED/MicroLED can really compensate to the point where 240Hz OLED looks clearer motion than 360Hz LCD (the OLED advantage is about 1.5x to 2.0x refresh rate, thanks to lack of visible GtG blurring added to the MPRT blurring). Samsung demoed a 240Hz OLED so 240Hz OLED panels are not far behind. If you&#039;ve seen MAME HLSL on a 4K 60Hz OLED screen, you already know that it looks fantastic--how the 4K is a massive improvement to CRT filter simulation. At this point, every phosphor dot on NTSC CRTs now becomes visible.

The holy grail would be display emulators (CRT electron beam emulator, plasma display emulator, etc) that piggyback on the sheer Hz for accurate temporal display emulation (including low blur, softer rolling flicker, phosphor decay, etc) and does whatever temporal technology is needed to comfortably reduce display motion blur.

The most fragile part is the one near the plug, that&#039;s what you must maintain straight.<br><br>I used to have an iPhone and the plastic they use for the charging cable is the biggest shit in the planet. Is one of the best examples of planned obsolescence. The charging cable that came with the phone died after like 2 or 3 years because the plastic literally disintegrated. I tried using adhesive tape to prolong it&#039;s life but eventually the cable was all wrapped in tape and it was disgusting and I had to keep putting more tape because it falls off with time. I bought a new charging cable (an Apple one), only the cable was like 20 fucking euros, a simple USB cable. And it happened the same than with the first cable, the plastic disintegrated in 2 or 3 years. Then I bought a cable of another brand and it lasted forever without the plastic to brake. Why?, simple: BECAUSE THEY USE A NORMAL PLASTIC THAT IS DURABLE ENOUGH, NOT THE SHIT THAT APPLE USES THAT IS MADE ON PURPOSE TO BREAK EACH 2 OR 3 YEARS SO YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM 20\u20ac EVERY 2 YEARS.<br><br>Having an Apple phone is advertised as &quot;a social status&quot;... like 90% of people that buy Apple phones use them for simple things and they don&#039;t need a phone so powerful. Imagine paying 1000$+ for a phone to then use it for YouTube, WhatsApp, listening to music and little more.

I don&#039;t ever remember creating 100MB partitions or 128MB partitions so it must be a default in some software, maybe Windows itself?

The Amiga I got in the 80s as a kid, I just decided to fulfill all my childhood dreams when that stuff was still relatively cheap. Bought tons of retrocomputing stuff in the 00s and early 10s when the consooming wasn&#039;t in full force and many still considered it junk. One of my A500s I got for five euros. I don&#039;t even know the prices now. Feel I&#039;d be worried about turning my A2000 on if I did and it&#039;d suck the fun out of it all. They&#039;re probably insane. lol<br><br>I remember when I switched from workbench and Amiga goodness to a 486 and DOS/Win 3.1 and while I appreciated the wider gaming palette it also immediately felt like a step back. Switched to Linux in ~2002 and it was ok but peak Amiga comfiness was never reached again. Then as an adult I got really into AmigaOS internals from a poweruser standpoint and things like ARexx scripting and couldn&#039;t believe how shit everything is today in comparsion. I actually don&#039;t do much with my A2000 anymore because a 060 is such overkill for everything, nowadays I spent most of my time with an relatively unexpanded (just some FastRAM) A600, but I kinda want to deck out one of my  A1200s I have lying around. (With a Blizzard card and a Delfina soundcard) I&#039;m not really up to the newest retro tech so that might be interesting. I feel the A1200 might be more at a sweet spot in terms of speed and I could remote into an ARM Linux box for a lot of stuff.

Some of the common reasons cited include:<br><br>- Incentives: In a socialist system, the government controls the means of production and there is often little incentive for individuals to work hard and be productive. This can lead to inefficiencies, low productivity, and a lack of innovation.<br><br>- Bureaucracy: Socialism can lead to the creation of large bureaucracies that are responsible for running the economy and allocating resources. This can lead to red tape, slow decision-making, and a lack of accountability.<br><br>- Central planning: In a socialist system, the government is responsible for making all important economic decisions, such as what to produce and how to produce it. This can lead to the misallocation of resources and the production of goods and services that are not in line with consumer demand.<br><br>- Price distortions: In a socialist system, prices are often set by the government rather than by market forces. This can lead to price distortions, which can result in shortages and surpluses of certain goods and services.<br><br>- Lack of flexibility: Socialism can make it difficult for the economy to adjust to changes in consumer demand or technological progress. This can result in economic stagnation and a lack of growth.<br><br>- Corruption: In some cases, socialism has been associated with corruption, as those in positions of power may abuse their authority for personal gain.<br><br>It is worth noting that different socialist systems have been implemented in different ways and have had varying levels of success. Additionally, some of the criticisms of socialism are also criticisms of certain implementations of socialism, rather than of the idea of socialism itself.", "time": 1676013295, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91443160, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91443106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91443106</a><br>But your mom will fuck anyone so something to think about", "time": 1676013385, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91443181, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:19:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ChatGPT on why the Labor Theory of Value doesn&#039;t work in a market based economy which is how the world has always worked-<br><br>The Labor Theory of Value is an economic theory that argues that the value of a good is determined by the amount of labor that goes into producing it. This theory was popular in the 19th century and was a central part of classical economics.<br><br>However, in a market economy, the Labor Theory of Value is often considered to be incorrect for several reasons:<br><br>- Neglects demand: The Labor Theory of Value does not take into account the role of demand in determining the value of a good. In a market economy, the value of a good is determined by both the supply of the good and the demand for the good. If there is high demand for a good, the value of the good will be higher, even if the amount of labor that goes into producing it is low.<br><br>- Ignores the role of capital: The Labor Theory of Value does not take into account the role of capital in production. Capital, such as machines and buildings, can greatly increase productivity and efficiency. The value of a good is not only determined by the amount of labor that goes into producing it, but also by the amount of capital that is used in production.<br><br>- Does not account for differences in skill: The Labor Theory of Value assumes that all labor is equal in terms of value, but this is not the case in reality. Different workers have different levels of skill and experience, and some workers are able to produce more value in the same amount of time than others.<br><br>- Does not reflect market realities: The Labor Theory of Value does not reflect the reality of how markets work. In a market economy, prices are determined by supply and demand, and prices are constantly changing as a result of changes in market conditions. The Labor Theory of Value does not account for this dynamic nature of markets.", "time": 1676013546, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91443188, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:19:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91441885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91441885</a><br>Can Dan give sources for its claims?", "time": 1676013586, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91443258, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91443181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91443181</a>", "filename": "0e83b89d108e522f00b1b17ea5ad32b47e-GettyImages-1253245215.rsquare.w700", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 700, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676014026295398, "time": 1676014026, "md5": "k5OzviZ9SFOHMwCmbsrmLQ==", "fsize": 87948, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91443380, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:41:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91443258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91443258</a><br>Go forth and spread the Good News of the AI, my son", "time": 1676014877, "resto": 91441885}, {"no": 91444417, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)04:40:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91442247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91442247</a><br>The funny thing is marx would immediately realize why he was wrong the second he sees a computer or modern automation<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;these lazy fucks press buttons and think that&#039;s labor, I was talking about mining coal. </span><br>People that do REAL labor are paid for it quite well in America, at least.

And you can do this without gutting your original dataset, and if you stay on the same seed, you flick between them and see if it sounds any better or avoids the Britishness.
