note:<br>-oleds are significantly dimmer than minileds.<br>minileds can usually do 1000+nits of brightness in HDR highlights, oleds are limited to 700 or so.<br>for monitor usage, the 700nits the oleds can do is more than enough, most users will turn the brightness down. for TV usage, especially in a bright room in the morning, the extra brightness from minileds makes sense<br>-oleds are susceptible to burn-in, minileds are not<br>current oleds are much better in this respect than the first ones. if you are using them primarily for gaming/media, you can expect at least 5 years without burn-in. you want to avoid oled for a work monitor tho.<br>-oleds have much better response times, making them a better choice for gaming<br><br>so, in conclusion:<br>-HDR400/600 monitors are not

When they were purchased, everyone moderately important was given a box of business cards and entered into the parent company&#039;s computer systems. Some people were given new job titles in the parent company&#039;s systems (and on their business cards). However, internally, we did not ever stop using our original job titles, and nothing really changed day-to-day for us. The new job title I received makes the work I was doing sound more impressive than it actually was, and I want to leverage that to get a better job. My plan is to list that job as 2 different jobs. 1 job with the original company name and job title. 1 job with the new company name and job title. Is this wrong? Could this come back to bite me?

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter. After I saturated the nib unit, that problem disappeared. Regardless, it&#039;s got a 1 year warranty so I can simply exchange if I ever run into issues.<br><br>So yeah, anons, talk about fountain pens. What&#039;er you using right now?

With regards to so-called misinformation, tiktok actually suppresses communists on its platform. <br><br>The other reason, apart from the difference in corporate structure, that TikTok in the West is meant to compete with the likes of Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp, YouTube, Snapchat and others. All other social media now have in some way a reels-like feature where you can find the same mindless content.<br><br>You cannot seem to conceive what the motivation of a Western company would have for promoting mindnumbing garbage. It is simply good business. Give the people what they want to see, and they will stay on the platform. <br><br>Douyin, in China, on the otherhand, has an upward limit of the amount of content you can see (if you are a child), and it is simply not geared toward retention of users but instead toward educating them. Douyin does not operate like TikTok in the West because the measure of success of Douyin is not based on how much advertising space it is able to sell but on preparing the youth for the future where China is a global superpower that other countries look towards. TikTok, on the otherhand, sells ads, like literally all social media, and is designed to make sure you see as many of them as possible.

The claim from the Westoids is that the PLA killed a bazillion people, specifically in Tienanmen Square, just for funsies. After all, the New York Times aid it, and they have never lied about a foreign government and its doings, not even a little bit. Wikileaks earned the ire of the U.S. by publishing leaked diplomatic cables - quite many of them. It is well known by now that among these cables were correspondences about how the U.S. necessarily intended to destroy Libya, for example. However, also among these very cables, were correspondences between Latin American diplomats who were actually in Beijing in 1989 who could speak to the violence that had occurred there but, most conspicuously, did not observe a massacre in Tienanmen Square. Oh well! Not to mention, there&#039;s the issue of the inflated deathtoll. Certainly lots of people were killed. China estimated around 300. About 250 bodies have been identified.

In fact, the women have even been conditioned to behave child-like because it pleases the men. Middle-eastern countries seem to have an obsession with marrying little girls off to grown men.

And well, there is also the thing with open source, and it is up to you if you care about it or not.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or should I just get a laptop from a large company that has decent Linux support?</span><br><br>Tbh if you dont care too much, just get a normal laptop with decent linux support. it does not have to use coreboot.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the benefit of coreboot other than it being open source?</span><br><br>Your device will boot faster (but neutering ME will slow it down anyway), you will get rid of all the restrictions in your normal bios by installing those (if there are any), and coreboot plays well with some fancy hardware mods (for example, it allows you to boot directly from express card to nvme adapter without clover, or you can adjust brightness of your screen easier if you use full HD mod on those older thinkpads like x230).", "time": 1672396398, "resto": 90593923}, {"no": 90600138, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)05:34:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90593923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90593923</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it worth buying a laptop that has coreboot (from an OEM linux vendor)?</span><br>no<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or should I just get a laptop from a large company that has decent Linux support?</span><br>your choice<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the benefit of coreboot other than it being open source?</span><br>you wont ever have to touch a woman", "time": 1672396473, "resto": 90593923}, {"no": 90600175, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)05:38:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90595607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90595607</a><br>meds", "time": 1672396703, "resto": 90593923}, {"no": 90600924, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)07:05:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90593923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90593923</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it worth buying a laptop that has coreboot (from OEM)</span><br>I only actually know three of these: System76, Starlabs and Purism.

Which is to say it uses all the same concepts as other languages and most programs are just libraries plus a little glue. The only difference being that you occasionally have to pass a &amp;var instead of a var, and free(). You can easily make a program in Ruby that performs better than one in C just by caring about cache locality. C is neither necessary nor sufficient to write good or performant software. But I do understand its appeal especially for hobbyists like myself. I have nothing to ship so writing my own argument parsers and binary trees and log algorithms and whatnot makes programming a lot more fun. I used to use C++ and it was so boring you just typed what you wanted done and it was done. C would be the same if the standard library was bigger and/or dependency management wasn&#039;t so hard.

Commercial passenger aircraft were only just around the late 30\u2019s hitting that point where it was viable. And by 1937 when the Hindenburg disaster occurred, aircraft had reached that point where transatlantic flight at much higher speed with many more people and far less crew was normal. By that time having 70+ passengers and 5-10 total crew on a flight from USA to Western Europe was doable without great expense. Albeit it was a different sort of market it appealed to, as you were crammed into a smaller space, something like a pan-am 314 clipper could come in a variety of configurations anywhere from 15-20 passengers in a very well equipped space with proper beds and a kitchen, to 70+ passengers in a seating only arrangement. <br>Airships were described as flying hotels, because they were more focused on the experience of the flight versus the goal of getting from point A to point B. There were intentions to use airships for simply mass travel where they could by all means hold far more passengers and do it at a lower cost, but they\u2019d also be much slower. <br>So many hours crammed into a small plane over an ocean was already bad enough. Quadruple the hours and quadruple the people and I\u2019m positive each airship passenger flight would have an average projected killcount the second someone blew out the shitter 2 hours into the journey.<br><br>But the big one was the crew required, that point I brought up about complexity in maintaining the operation. Airships had crews of 30-70 people on them, depending on the passenger count and services offered, but even just functional operation needed upwards of two dozen men.<br>Passenger Airplanes could get away with 4-5 crew, maybe a few stewards. And could either go more or less depending on needs. For some flights just 3-4 crew for 60-70 passengers was doable.<br>Some more luxury oriented flights would have 4 crew and 10 stewards or more.", "filename": "A68C96F0-4D4B-41C4-BB56-3832526AD53C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 858, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672383689057595, "time": 1672383689, "md5": "QzYkTapF4qt1vEy0zwvHyw==", "fsize": 375688, "resto": 90597717}, {"no": 90598227, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90597717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90597717</a><br>HISTORY IS FAKE THE EARTH IS FLAT", "time": 1672383755, "resto": 90597717}, {"no": 90598261, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:07:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90597969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90597969</a><br>Mostly chefs and bellhops and shit.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is a murderer: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The murderer is an essential part of a society, but useless by itself; he can only function in the context of a complete society. Linux is normally used in combination with the industrial society: the whole society is basically industrialization with Linux added, or Industrialization/Linux.

That provides something very similar to redundancy of RAID.<br>There are downsides - you don&#039;t get any performance increase (in general) compared to using just one drive, and the parity needs to be updated on schedule, it&#039;s not realtime.

They probably expected you not to pursue further action and thought the issue would go away if they just ignored it. Their mistake. <br>Only case where that doesn&#039;t apply is if the seller works alone and got covid in the recent infection wave.

First big one is March 28th, their 13th anniversary sale, probably going to start the 27th if it&#039;s like last year.

The short version is: Cheap servos work really well, unless you need torque. They have plastic gearing inside and will not provide as much force as some applications need. They are also have some quirks, some are the usual servo ones (limited range of mobility, usually 180\u00b0, not relevant for your usecase), but cheaper ones may have a minimum angle of movement (think of it like a deadzone on a controller) and some will move a little upon powerup. Also they have limited resolution, which should be expected. <br>You can always increase resolution in exchange for torque with gearing, but making gears so small is hard, and making them bigger means a bigger machine/robot. <br>The two positives: They are really cheap and you don&#039;t need a &quot;controller&quot;. The controller is part of the motor, meaning you give it a angle it should reach by providing a pulse of a specific length, so all you need is a chip that can provide a accurate pulse. Any arduino nano can do that, so the &quot;controller&quot; part will cost you 2-4$. Use a ESP8266 if you don&#039;t want to have to use serial connection with a wire. <br><br>Given how cheap those parts are, you can test a ultra cheap prototype (with just one hand of servos) for maybe 15$ or something, barely any risk. If you want to use higher quality motors, prices will be higher. <br><br><a href=\"#p90542278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90542278</a><br>They stopped doing that as much, at least for me.

Because if the samples are essentially the same as everyone else, but different on such a microscopic level that you are effectively still getting the same product and it takes an AI scan to find the watermark, then it&#039;s only different from everyone else by a fraction of a percent. And very minimal mixing will change the sample by orders of magnitude more than that. And plus, what are they really gonna do?

Cut down on the brainpower used per-user, to fit more generations in the same amount of processing power.

Monetizing the userbase isn&#039;t where the big money is, it&#039;s in cashing out to investors, so every one of these platforms eventually has an impetus to sanitize itself in the future hope of selling. The target audience for the product isn&#039;t the users, the users ARE the product to be attracted and sold off to investors.<br><br>So, combine those two things and you get a website that barely works, hosting an AI that gets progressively dumber and slower, with increasing censorship and arbitrary invisible walls, with all the bugs those bring.", "filename": "1495061498670", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 447, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1672394207349990, "time": 1672394207, "md5": "XiH5CWGd3RhAqNMQCnOoaQ==", "fsize": 31624, "resto": 90598153}, {"no": 90599855, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:58:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How am I so good at flirting with the AI compared to humans?

Most companies and creators only use TikTok as a funnel to their other services and social media that actually make money. Some even refer to using TikTok as &quot;the funnel method&quot; because that&#039;s the only way you make any income. No one gets rich directly from TikTok (which, ironically, I think contributes to why it actually has some good content if you know where to look. Most people that aren&#039;t generic normies aren&#039;t super motivated by money or even viewers. They genuinely post and shit they find worthwhile or funny).

It seems clear that you do actually understand that such comparisons are valid, so you don&#039;t get to cast aside criticisms simply by saying &quot;well it&#039;s free.&quot; I can use Windows without paying and the only way that Microsoft tries to annoy me into paying is by sticking a watermark that asks me to activate windows in the corner.

What it does impact, however, is the way in which a note may resonate within that instrument, and thus /which/ (not how many, like your regarded ass said) harmonics above the fundamental are ringing and at which dynamic. This is also something that you have to think about on a case by case basis - most instruments designed today do take in mind the A=440 standard, and thus, if the instrument maker is an absolute master, it is made to succeed in making sure that the soundwaves that travel through the instrument amplify the desired harmonics more. However, virtually all instruments that are the same (i.e. all Bb clarinets, not basset horns &amp; bassoons) will have the same harmonic series, in a case where they are built under near identical conditions, /regardless/ of the tuning used.<br><br>B) the density of the harmonic series does not equate to a more &quot;spiky/metallic&quot; sound you fucking dumbass - like this anon said <a href=\"#p90588533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90588533</a> the cello is incredibly rich, and it does not sound neither spiky nor metallic - in fact, the cello is often said to be the instrument that most sounds like the human voice. the density simply equates to a denser and more &quot;rich&quot; (by virtue of # of harmonics above the fundamental) sound. The &quot;metallic&quot; quality comes from the instrument&#039;s material (and/or effects, if you&#039;re thinking about a guitar).

But anyway, this is a complicated question and linked to a huge rabbithole of knowledge about tuning systems. If you&#039;re interested, you should watch the relevant videos on Adam Neely&#039;s channel and try googling terms like &quot;equal temperament&quot;, &quot;historical temperaments&quot;. Unfortunately, this is made harder because of a significant amount of spiritual nonsense being attached to these topics, so you need to have your bullshit meter set on high.<br>Anyway, you probably know that while the particular frequencies like 440 Hz and 432 Hz are largely irrelevant, there are special ratios with characteristic sounds to the human brain. As a rule, simple fractions with small numbers like 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 sound calm and consonant, while fractions like 133/101 sound unstable and dissonant. There used to be a lot of diversity in tuning, with many weird systems and instruments with differing number of keys per octave. The problem is that you can&#039;t create these perfect intervals everywhere with a finite number of keys. So if you make some intervals particularly nice and consonant, others get very dissonant and it becomes impossible to play a nice melody in some keys.<br>As time went on and music became more modern, people found it more important for all keys to be usable. Therefore everyone gradually changed to equal temperament, in which the frequencies are equally spaced by a ratio of the 12th root of 2. The number 12 is partially historical accident but also makes deep mathematical sense. If you enumerate the numbers N whose powers provide successively better approximations of simple fractions like 3/2, you get 5, 7, 12, 41, etc. 7 is too few for an intricate melody even from the medieval era, and it&#039;s impractical to make acoustic keyboard instruments with 41 keys per octave.", "time": 1672357093, "resto": 90581403}, {"no": 90592944, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:39:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90592605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90592605</a><br><a href=\"#p90592920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90592920</a><br>cont. <a href=\"#p90592931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90592931</a><br>As for the black and white keys, the white keys are the scale of C Major, i.e. the keys that sound consonant when you hit them together with C.
