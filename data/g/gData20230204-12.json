Also you should be able to converge to a &quot;character&quot; within 3-4 image-gen attempts, just think &quot;stable diffusion really listens to skin tone, eye color, etc.&quot; and then certain characters need special words to draw attention like &quot;iris&quot;, &quot;pupil&quot;, &quot;attached earlobe&quot;, &quot;downcast expression&quot; etc.<br><br>ya it&#039;s cross model, it&#039;s some stable-diffusion built-in thing. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s completely random, but.... The logic behind it is probably that, in the old days when photos started to be taken, only 10 million &quot;blacks&quot; were actually sub-saharan africans, and most black for whom pictures existed where probably either Dravidians of some sort, Aboriginals, or even Native Americans (not tanned but literally non-african black). But that&#039;s just my guess.<br><br>For your comics, try ComfyUI. Take out a paper and pencil and map out grids, then you can do this... you probably wouldn&#039;t quite want to do this in reality, but it&#039;s just an extreme example:<br>- Let the comic be 1024 x 2048 pixels<br>- Let it be broken into two grids of 1024 x 1024 pixels each<br>- Add a ComfyUI node to &quot;RescaleLatent&quot; to 1024 x 1024 at bilinear rescaling of the latent for two output images, and use a &quot;LatentComposition&quot; node to shuffle them into place.<br>- Generate the images at some absurd resolution like 4k x 4k, and feed them into the down-scaling process.<br>- img2img the 1024 x 2048 comic strip with prompts like &quot;comic panelling&quot; to fill-in comic details, half-toning and the like... it kinda-sorta works.<br><br>Of course this is insane but it&#039;s technically possible. You can even put a person in the comic like burger-anon does, except he doesn&#039;t make it so complicated probably.<br><br>I need to get around to uploading my AOM2 improvements, they don&#039;t have the issue you worry about.<br><br>but for comics really try comfyui, label individual panels &quot;output-panel1&quot; &quot;output-panelright&quot; and then configure krita or w/e to auto-refresh layers as more-recent files appear if possible.", "filename": "03302-3628bad0,2825701144", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 704, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675504739012241, "time": 1675504739, "md5": "WmsNxYJ/4p3lhRDTClt7Xw==", "fsize": 543532, "resto": 91329375}, {"no": 91329495, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:59:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91329423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91329423</a>", "filename": "tmp4ejzd1q1", "ext": ".png", "w": 832, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675504744658674, "time": 1675504744, "md5": "VjDvSVQ8Sex21HadLLq1fw==", "fsize": 1786837, "resto": 91329375}, {"no": 91329496, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)04:59:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91329486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91329486</a><br>Fucking AI restaurants.

You&#039;re probably going to feel cheated if you paid $1,000 for one of these monitors in mint condition. If you find one for a reasonable price and not too much usage, then great. Most likely you will not. I personally used a Philips 107B for a while. It was a decidedly &quot;OK&quot; monitor when new. No crazy resolutions, no crazy refresh rates, utterly forgettable. But mine was $20 brand new in the box. I actually owned a Dell P1130 for a while, but I ended up selling it because I just liked the Philips tube better.

Took me years of searching to find something like that for under $200, and only by a stroke of luck- he had listed a desk for sale and I saw the monitor in the photos of this desk. He was actually planning to toss it, so by coming to collect it I saved him a trip to the dump. In the unlikely case that you get a deal like that, great.

It is made up of 4 separate models that work together.<br>    These models are all derived from different repositories which are all linked. All the models have been modified for this use case (some substantially so).<br><br>    First, an autoregressive transformer stack predicts discrete speech &quot;tokens&quot; given a text prompt. This model is very similar to the GPT model used by DALLE, except it operates on speech data.<br>    Based on: [GPT2 from Transformers](https://huggingface.c<wbr>o/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2)<wbr><br><br>    Next, a CLIP model judges a batch of outputs from the autoregressive transformer against the provided text and stack ranks the outputs according to most probable. You could use greedy or beam-search decoding but in my experience CLIP decoding creates considerably better results.<br>    Based on [CLIP from lucidrains](https://github.com/luci<wbr>drains/DALLE-pytorch/blob/main/dall<wbr>e_pytorch/dalle_pytorch.py)<br><br>    Next, the speech &quot;tokens&quot; are decoded into a low-quality MEL spectrogram using a VQVAE.<br>    Based on [VQVAE2 by rosinality](https://github.com/rosi<wbr>nality/vq-vae-2-pytorch)<br><br>    Finally, the output of the VQVAE is further decoded by a UNet diffusion model into raw audio, which can be placed in a wav file.<br>    Based on [ImprovedDiffusion by openai](https://github.com/openai/i<wbr>mproved-diffusion)", "time": 1675476471, "resto": 91323238}, {"no": 91323420, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:10:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91323238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91323238</a><br>Op image for next time", "filename": "FB34E3C7-E67B-45B1-9EB9-EA773FA7C210", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 972, "h": 1009, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675476602080206, "time": 1675476602, "md5": "62NW3SfXNohi9tRGqVctTA==", "fsize": 518020, "resto": 91323238}, {"no": 91323432, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:10:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There needs to be organization in these threads so shill distraction in minimized.<br>The last threads showed we need to know what factors determine:<br>1) Data set size: How many hours of audio do you need (vall-e = 60k hrs, 11 labs similar?)<br>2) Emotion encoding: which transcribers are best?<br>3) Reverse engineering 11 labs : What ML did they use?<br>4) Reverse engineering other effective TTS ML techniques algorithms.<br>5) Existing Tortoise TTS forkers: What have they done?<br>6) Distributed Training (Federated Learning) ignore shills who say  its impossible without giving details or numbers.

It&#039;s hard to make plastic look like real metal and the only other practical options are to include pre-painted parts, or to use coatings (ie Bandai&#039;s golden PG Unicorn, or the swords from RG Exia). But these techniques add a fuckton of cost and labour. Any imperfections will be amplified tenfold and parts have to be connected on edges or undersides as any cut will reveal the original underlying plastics. Those who care about metal looks will paint their kits themselves anyway, so the marbling is a nice compromise to keep things affordable.

That&#039;s why you find mostly  welders, plumber, factory workers, blue collar trades, etc. To be more populist and freedom-loving. It&#039;s not because the work makes them that way, it&#039;s because the work is attractive to that sort of person.<br>Conversely, the same phenomenon is at play with highly abstractive and more idealistic types thinkers. You know the type, you find them in faculty of Colleges of Arts and Sciences, and also in Computer Science. These types are able to more completely divorce themselves from reality to form what they think is a more ideal view of the world and the future. In reality they often struggle with implementing their theories in a manner that benefits anyone.<br>Here&#039;s the kicker though: society needs both types, otherwise it can&#039;t function. If everything was run by mathematicians,  engineers, and factory workers then innovation and scientific progress would grind to a halt (like the late Soviet Union). However, if everything is controlled and centrally planned by blue hair art types and trannies then you get the clown world of America today. <br>If we want the American engine to keep operating at all we need to figure out how to balance and serve these two types of people in a more or less equal fashion, or else the infrastructure is going to break down and there will be no one to fix it. Imagine if tomorrow the water just went off, and stayed off. What would you do? Do you know anything about water filtration on the scale of a household? What about a neighborhood? <br>The people that do know about that have been relentlessly shat on as less than human for years now, having to work holidays and still getting paid $45k.

Smoothing is applied to the measurement to make it easier to read but it&#039;s not a factor unless it&#039;s heavily smoothed, critical bandwidth means you can&#039;t hear all the fluctuation, much like you can&#039;t hear the beats of pure tones despite the change in amplitude. <br><a href=\"#p91328152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91328152</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We</span><br>You keep pretending that you reflect the opinions of the rest of the people here when in reality most of them likely want you to stop samefagging and just kill yourself.

Imagine them like a box that holds your video. There are 2 important things that matter for reducing size. The first is bitrate; that is, how many bits per second your video has. The second is the encoder, which is a sort of algorithm that takes a video input and tries to efficiently compress the data in a variety of ways. <br>Generally, the more compressed you try to make your video and preserving as much quality as possible, the longer the encode process will take.<br>For example, say your source video is a 2GB movie with a bitrate of 8000kbps (8M for short), and its encoder is h264 (most common encoder). You can try to reduce the size strictly by reducing the bitrate, which will likely lead to a perceptible quality loss, or you can reduce the bitrate AND switch to a more efficient encoder like vp9 or av1. These more modern encoders have a caveat that they&#039;re generally slower, but they can net you serious savings in space. It takes some experimentation to see what you like in terms of speed, quality, and bitrate tradeoffs, but I can start you off with a baseline to work with for av1:<br><br>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libsvtav1 -c:a copy -crf 40 -preset 4 output.webm<br><br>This will take your input (just swap the file name and type), convert it to av1, and target a constant rate factor (crf) of 40. The preset option is sort of like a slider for quality in exchange for speed. Lower is more efficient and higher quality but slower to encode, and higher is less efficient and lower quality but faster.

Alternate reference frames are &#039;invisible&#039; frames, never shown to the user, but which are used as a reference when creating the final frames. This allows the encoder to be a lot more efficient, so always use it. It is the default in the standalone vpxenc libvpx-vp9 encoder as of libvpx 1.9.0 and 1.10.0. --auto-alt-ref=6 can also be used, but this is a --profile=2 thing, so if your HW doesn&#039;t support 10-bit HW decoding, it won&#039;t work.

If it still doesn&#039;t work, just become super friendly and talk a lot about how you are in love with your job..so long and what tech do you love to work it..so long that they will not be able to ask you about shit that you don&#039;t know.

CAN I SET UP??? IS WORKING?<br>So the most basic things are the most important to cover first.<br><br>Also, if less than 10% of people who actually stop to read the OP will or even can do something, like Dreambooth for instance, it is probably best left to the general index rather than included in the OP.

I&#039;ll put move suggestions in this post and proposed new OP in next post.<br><br>Merge sdg-link and sdgoldmine somehow, make a master page, maybe a new page altogether.<br>Move GPU performance data link to that merged page.<br>Move the link to News to that merged page but always keep it at the top.<br>Move inpainting demo to top of inpainting guide, as it&#039;s more specialized.<br>Add a note to top of sd-nativeisekaitoo (or its replacement) to check out sdg-link or the new merged thing for more options (there is also stuff you guys should add for AMD users, I need some time to test some things and then I will tell you in one of the threads depending on how it goes, and maybe whoever owns that guide can add it or something)<br>Add the cloud hosted ones to the new page you guys are talking about<br>Make sure all the models/textual inversion etc are linked in the new sdg-link thing and updated, then remove https://rentry.org/lftbl and https://rentry.org/sdmodels from the OP. These are both good resources but less accessible than the others. Model mixing is less basic and sdmodels is sort of a suggestion list that will always be somewhat limited or outdated. Good to look at for those who want to but they can also just ask in thread like everyone does anyways, or use the search on huggingface or civitai<br>Move all of the guides to their own section in the new sdg-link if not already linked there, then delete that section entirely from the OP<br>Do the same with tools and resources (it already links sdg-link for half of the stuff anyways, just merge in goldmine and make sure the headings are good and organized for sdg-link)<br>Do the same with SD plugins<br>Keep related boards just in case<br>Move official discord to near the top of new sdg-link<br>Add both the old &quot;failed&quot; catbox userscript to sdg-link and the new one that was mentioned in this thread, under an appropriate section<br><br>I&#039;ll post the suggested OP next", "time": 1675499043, "resto": 91327229}, {"no": 91328460, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)03:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91328445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91328445</a><br>Helps if I link T_T<br>https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tune-<wbr>A-Video-library/Tune-A-Video-Traini<wbr>ng-UI", "time": 1675499120, "resto": 91327229}, {"no": 91328495, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)03:28:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91328446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91328446</a><br>So the OP would be something like the below (you could also replace the bit at the end with one of the plugins if you all decide you want to do that):<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Comprehensive Index (Resources, Guides, Installs, etc)</span><br>https://rentry.org/ the new sdg-link or goldmine or whatever<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Demos, no login needed</span><br>txt2img: https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabi<wbr>lityai/stable-diffusion<br>img2img: https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggi<wbr>ngface/diffuse-the-rest<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Local Install</span><br>Nvidia GPU: https://rentry.org/voldy<br>AMD GPU/CPU: https://rentry.org/sd-nativeisekait<wbr>oo (and edit this guide to emphasize the Pip-CPU thing a bit more, I will also give some advice on that for some unusual cases later)<br>Node-based UI (GPU only): link to comfyui<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cloud Hosted</span><br>rentry.org/the new page you&#039;re talking about making to have the cloud options and maybe also you should add some setup guides for the non paperspace ones or some helpful hints or mention pricing for non free stuff<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Models, Textual Inversion &amp; Embeddings</span><br>https://civitai.com/<br>https://huggingface.co/<br>https://rentry.org/hdgrecipes<br>https://rentry.org/embeddings<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Related Boards</span><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/h/catalog#s=hdg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/h/hdg</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/e/catalog#s=sdg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/e/sdg</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/d/catalog#s=ddg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/d/ddg</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/vt/catalog#s=vtai\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/vt/vtai</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/aco/catalog#s=asdg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/aco/asdg</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/trash/catalog#s=sdg\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/trash/sdg</a><br><br>Please Note: 4chan strips metadata from uploads, so if you want to share your prompt/settings when you post, simply upload your image to catbox.moe (backup litterbox.catbox.moe) and post the link in this thread.
