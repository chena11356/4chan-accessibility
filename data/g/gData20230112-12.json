All laborious boring tasks for people, for businesses. I promise you, no one is really enjoying being a customer service person. They just enjoy getting out the house. People can find purpose and meaning doing something greater than mundane, repetitive, robotic tasks that waste most of our lives. Think about basically every job in existence right now. A lot of it is mundane work with very little creativity. When these jobs are gone, people&#039;s minds will expand. Possibilities open. Instead of focusing on a 9-5, you focus on broader purpose. Create real value in the world. Explore you real talents. Reach highs never before possible while you slave away at a 9-5 doing boring shit. Maybe people will be more gravitated to arts and science. New discoveries will be made. People will be free to explore their intellectual curiosity without being limited by money. When AI is providing so much service, the economy will flourish. The gross domestic products will multiply. And everyone will have access to great healthcare, services, taxis, food, no one will for a second think about these basic needs.

I reinstall windows on a different computer and nothing happens for about five days until I decide to use that link again to make a sound file and like a day or two later the glitch happens.

I don&#039;t prep myself, but if I was living in a country that was at war I&#039;d probably start creating a bug out bag. My grandparents had to flee war as children and the stories they told about that were horrible. Also affected them for the rest of their lives. If I can alleviate some of the fears etc. for myself by having done my due dilligence, I consider that a plus. <br>A bug out bag doesn&#039;t assume you fight against people attacking you or that you will be a survivalist in the forest, just that you can maybe easily handle 3-5 days outside of home should you need to. <br>In my case the fak is for fishing and hiking as I said, and while the israeli bandage is a bit overkill (Realistically the main advantage of it, being easy and quick to apply, isn&#039;t likely to be vital in the types of injuries you get while fishing or hiking) having a fak is nice. If you have ever been with someone on a hike and they either get the shits or constipated, it&#039;s nice having a pill to give them. I just carry stuff I am likely to use, mostly painkillers, water purification tablets, stuff against too much or too little shitting, disinfectant, disposable gloves, tweezers, plasters, some blister remedies, duct tape, crepe bandage and something against inflammation. Seems to be able to handle most injuries you can get while hiking. If it&#039;s something more serious, I can probably fashion something out of those to delay death until help arrives and if it&#039;s more serious than that, I&#039;ll be dead and won&#039;t have to worry. <br>In your case, a water bottle or two, maybe purification tablets, cash, passport, a spare set of clothes and food for a few days in a backpack might suffice, maybe add a trashbag as a bivy should the need arise.", "time": 1673390588, "resto": 90822716}, {"no": 90824694, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)17:44:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90824480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824480</a><br><a href=\"#p90824671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90824671</a><br>And if you do make a fak, remember to look up how to use the stuff (preferably take a course and get some experience, but looking stuff up is at least a substitution, if not a great one).<br>But realistically the further away you are from the front the less likely that this will be your issue.

I guess the belt is meant as a makeshift tourniquet, might be good to have a proper one with you. <br>Other than that, getting a organizer or bag might be a good idea. In my case a normal pouch I put in my backpack is fine, because all wounds likely to happen on a hike are unlikely to kill you quickly, so I have time to pull out a bag, open it and rummage around for the proper items. In your case a molle pouch with decent organization might be a good idea if your backpack is molle compatible. That way you can carry it standalone, or attach it to the outside of your backpack for quick access, or the inside for normal storage/lower profile. <br>And don&#039;t use too small of a pouch, usually makes organization a mess. <br>Also in your case spending some time making your first aid kit retard proof might be good, if against all odds you needed it you&#039;d likely be in shock and have the adrenaline running, so making the steps needed to be thought about minimal is good. In that regard a israeli bandage might actually be good, pretty foolproof to apply. <br>And lastly I guess your mission is striking a balance, preparing for the worst is good, but at some point you reached a &quot;good enough&quot; point and then it might be better if you can ignore/supress the issue and go back to normal life as much as possible for mental health.

You can probably get few thousands of kilometers before running into an issue. But that doesn&#039;t mean flat won&#039;t happen.<br>Yes, flat can be sometimes repaired easy. Easiest is to run slime that will seal the flat. Works great in normal temperature, when it&#039;s too hot or too cold it might not work, but ok. Some scooters even have this goo inside already, that thing is better than slime. <br>Yes, the tire repair rubber thingy also can work. But I wouldn&#039;t call it easy myself, because it&#039;s kinda messy (I would rather just fix bicycle tube since I can do that in 10 minutes) and it&#039;s also not as good seal on scooter tires, but it can work.<br>However you still can get flat on the side of the tire (just on the edge of the thread pattern is enough) and none of the above will work. Or you can mess up the tire repair rubber thingy. Or your valve might get damaged in which case tire needs to go down. Or you can just run the tire down with use. And this is where the nightmare comes. Replacing small tire like this is harder than replacing a tire on a car.<br>I mean, it is possible to repair it, but it&#039;s hard and you should be prepared for that. I do recommend going tubeless, but I&#039;m not going to hide the fact that it&#039;s hard to replace. You should be prepared for it if you decide to go tubeless.<br>When I got first unrepairable flat after 2400km I was one month without my scooter, because with my tools and knowledge I was not able to replace it. I bought proper tools then and eventually I was able to replace it. Even with right tools it&#039;s a pain. Services ask like $150, some even $200 to do it and many won&#039;t do it at all.<br>I know what I&#039;m talking about, I have done the tire replacement couple of dozen times.

What you guys are referring to as GNU HURD, is in fact, GNU/GNU HURD, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus GNU HURD. GNU HURD is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Dozens of computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is narrowly used today is often called &quot;GNU HURD&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a GNU HURD, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. GNU HURD is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#039;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. GNU HURD is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with GNU HURD added, or GNU/GNU HURD. All the so-called &quot;GNU HURD&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/GNU HURD.

Arithmetic with prefix notation is also easier to grok once you get used to it.<br>- Python has become very bloated and complex over the years<br>- Clojure uses persistent data structures for everything by default. They eliminate many classes of bugs, and it&#039;s impossible to do functional programming at good speeds without them.<br>- In general, if you want FP but aren&#039;t into Haskell-style type tetris, there is no better option than Clojure.<br>- Clojure has much better support for multi-threading<br>- Scheme is one of the easiest languages to implement yourself, e.g. on an unusual platform or as an extension language in a larger project <br>- Racket is great if you want to create your own domain-specific language <br>- REPL-centric interactive development (I can post some videos if you don&#039;t know what I mean)<br>- Clojure people in particular just make everything they touch more simple and usable. For example .edn is pretty much the best data format there is, and it&#039;s integrated into everything in Clojure; Hiccup syntax is much nicer to write than regular HTML, and so on.<br>- Clojure and Python can use most of each other&#039;s libraries, so Python&#039;s larger ecosystem counts for very little<br>- Python is used by a lot of beginner programmers, so much of the code you find in the wild is of low quality. Clojure is mostly used by experienced Java devs who wanted a simpler and more FP-centric language, and by experienced Lisp programmers who wanted to stop being NEETs.<br>- as a general gripe with C++/Java-style OOP languages, see https://youtube.com/watch?v=aSEQfqN<wbr>YNAc<br>- Main thing I still like about Python is exploratory programming.

Postgres also outperforms Mongo in almost all queries. It comes with a set of very useful extensions for which you will not find an equivalent that has a comparable implementation elsewhere (except if it&#039;s a db specialized in solving that exact problem). I am talking about extensions like PostGIS that help with storing geospacial data and TimescaleDB for time-series data.<br><br>There are advantages in using MongoDB thoug. The main point being storing unstructured data. Let&#039;s say you have a usecase where you need to create a table with a dynamic number of columns/labels. In this case using a document data store makes more sense and may be more efficient. Instead of using a table with 120 columns of which 80 will be null most of the time you can use JSONB to store the information you need. However, Postgres does now also act as a document data store with the JSONB Type. However it won&#039;t be as performant for JSON data as Mongo or Cassandra.<br><br>Finally there&#039;s the debate of horizontal scalability. By design, relational databases scale vertically (you add more computing power to your machine instead of creating a cluster of server). NoSQL databases are normally much better at scaling horizontally but Postgres and MySQL have removed most of the obstacles regarding horizontal scalability. As a matter of fact, Facebook, handles billions of requests per second and holds trillions of items according to their estimates, uses MySQL as their database. They have a bit more than 1000 servers running MySQL in a horizontally distributed fashion. Similarly, Instagram does the same with PostgreSQL. You shard, replicate, use hashing keys like with nosql dbs.", "time": 1673525306, "resto": 90844321}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 90808935, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/hsg/ - Home Server General", "com": "cable management edition<br><br>READ THE WIKI! &amp; help by contributing:<br>https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki<wbr>/Home_server<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NAS Case Guide.

I fucking hate it because it leads to shit being out of order and makes stuff more confusing than I needs to be (eg plex and jellyfin will show grouped series in chronological release order, which is great! but when they are all lumped into season 0 1 and 2, it fucks that ordering up and puts the movies before the first season)<br>Putting them all together like this also fucks with things like anilistsync, because there is not a single anime database that groups shows together like that, and it will be unable to find &quot;Made in Abyss - Season 02&quot; because the databases all have it as &quot;Made in Abyss: Scorching Sun of the Golden City - Season 01&quot;<br>It also makes more sense to split them apart because different studios can work on different seasons and they could have entirely seperate, non-congruos storylines, for example Tokyo Ghoul: Re is &quot;technially&quot; season 3 of the series, and yet it&#039;s done by a different production company entirely and follows an entirely different story - ergo it is not a new season of the same show, and noone except IMDB considers it as such.<br><br>Just my autistic rant, but tl;dr is it depends if you care about sorting anime correctly or not.", "time": 1673497961, "resto": 90808935}, {"no": 90849455, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)23:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90849439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90849439</a><br><a href=\"#p90849281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90849281</a><br>Also if you go the sonarr route, I would highly reccomend getting it to add the IMDB or TVDB ID to the end of the folder names as it makes jellyfin/plex picking it up a billion times easier and 100% accurate.

Imagine you have your headphones in but don&#039;t have anything playing, then get a discord ping.  You&#039;ll only hear the last few milliseconds of the tone and will hear popping/clicks/noise as the DAC initializes.

While I see nothing wrong with them in themselves, as they are admittedly pretty good value for the price, four is just mindless consumerism, contradictory to his &quot;philosophy&quot;. He started using every single shitty pseudominimalist, ncurses-based program, used a shitty riced out i3 setup of dubious actual productivity (like all tiling wms), then fell for the full Suckless meme and went in even deeper. Then he started making videos shitting on Python and praising C, which is ironic considering he is not even a programmer by his own admission. He effectively spent years trying out, configuring and hopelessly trying to integrate tens of meme programs to build what is, combined, effectively a shittier Emacs, just like most of /g/ was doing in their &quot;productive&quot; desktop threads a year or two ago. Then he read the Unabomber manifesto and blindly accepted it without constructively analyzing it first, same with the anarcho-primitivist ideology that was all the rage about a year and a half ago on 4chan and 8ch. While he stated on his website that he &quot;didn&#039;t browse 4chan much anymore&quot; it was obvious this wasn&#039;t the case.Then he went and took the memes way too far, and unironically went to live in isolation. While I see nothing wrong in itself, the actual reason he did it is massive cringe. He has the mentality of someone 10 years younger than he is, yet he acts like a literal boomer jokingly criticizing &quot;zoomers&quot; despite he himself being the worst example of a millennial. He attacks &quot;nerds&quot; when it&#039;t painfully obvious he&#039;s deeply unhappy with himself, as it was obviously self-directed criticism thinly veiled as an edgy dabbing video.
