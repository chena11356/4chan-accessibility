Since CPU prices are almost identical, might as well look at Ryzen 7k but the motherboards are overpriced for what they offer (compared to intel Z690/B690).

No thunderbolt ofc. <br>Intel 13th gen (or 12th) has 13700k and 12900k at same prices, both are kinda power hungry, but have intel Quicksync and idle lower than Ryzen chips.

Ouranos is lightweight and sits nicely in-ear. Olina SE fairs worse with it&#039;s non-custom, generic oblong shell that feels loose and cumbersome. Ouranos wins.<br><br>Stock accessories: I like the functionality of Olina SE cable: it is lightweight, memory-resistant, and just works, but aesthetically sucks. Olina SE stock tips are bad. Ouranos sleek 2-core is relatively uncommon so nice to see, but it&#039;s not well-behaved (holds bends &amp; tangles). Ouranos tips are typical Tinhifi/TKZK, a nice set of both regular &amp; wider bore tips that I do like. No winner, both subpar packages.<br><br>Sound: Same DAC &amp; cable, straight from weeks of Olina SE listening to the Ouranos. Ouranos is harder-than-average to drive, nothing crazy.<br><br>Bass: Ouranos reaches deeper into sub bass. Plays with a heavier weight than Olina SE. Olina SE retains advantage of supernatural speed in the low-end, doesn&#039;t ever linger, plays and then decays.<br><br>Mids: Olina SE has the more correct mids, in line with expected neutral. Ouranos is more U-shaped. Pro is nice macro contrast between bass, mids, and treble, more exciting listen. Con is non-linear mids, slight recess.<br><br>Treble: Ouranos treble tuning is very good. Enhanced vocals, but still smooth, resistant to sibilance, ending with a natural rolloff. Olina SE presents as brighter, clearer, and with more extension. Olina SE excels at delivering on female vocals and treble detail being center-stage. Olina SE is superior at layering and separation, Ouranos is a more cohesive sound.<br><br>If you like: treble detail, bright, neutral, less bass, then choose Olina SE.<br>If you like: warm/smooth listen, balanced U-shape, a little more rumble/slam, then choose Ouranos.", "filename": "20230106_170409", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3161, "h": 2183, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673053749468824, "time": 1673053749, "md5": "0nQhiHs9LHeQYp6uJDGkKg==", "fsize": 2033328, "resto": 90740614}, {"no": 90751007, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90750921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90750921</a><br>Thanks for the write up, did you order the c3 as well?<br>Anyways i wanted to get some anons take on the tkzk so thanks for testing it out", "time": 1673054136, "resto": 90740614}, {"no": 90751068, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:20:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90751007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90751007</a><br>You&#039;re welcome anon.

When you torrent, your IP is public to everyone. The default thing to do is to pressure the ISP to hand out the subscriber&#039;s information that belongs to the IP.

Sorry, it&#039;s the way of the world.&quot;<br><br>Moran told Motherboard that this piece was a commission from their Vietnam-based studio, Kart Studio, which was established three years ago. The studio consists of a group of digital artists who collaborate on pieces, they said. A full-body portrait with a complex background can cost upwards of $500, according to Kart Studio&#039;s website, with the studio sending the commissioner the art at various stages, including the initial sketch. For the muse illustration, a different artist started it, and Moran stepped in to complete it. It took Moran a month to complete (about 100 hours, they said) and they wanted to show the final piece to the community on Reddit.", "filename": "1672972689347363", "ext": ".png", "w": 832, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 162, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673059327740688, "time": 1673059327, "md5": "Sj6ySpEeJf8y3fmAC/t4qg==", "fsize": 1728092, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "man-was-banned-from-art-forum-because-of-supposed", "replies": 35, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 28}, {"no": 90752252, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90752223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90752223</a><br>You cant expect anyone on reddit to be rational or even correct 99% of the time. r/art sounds awful, guarantee the amount of true professionals on there is little to none.

That should be less than you&#039;ve brought in at the end of the month. Take the surplus, put the lions share in savings, and take some cash out. There, now if you wanna go out and waste it, you can, and all you have to do is have a rule that you never use plastic for nonessentials. When the cash is gone, it&#039;s gone, and until next month you&#039;re done spending on frivolities. <br><br>or more succinctly, having trouble keeping track of your spending without an app seems to me to be a signal that you&#039;ve overcomplicated your life. The solution is to simplify it, not add a layer of monitoring and analysis. Everyone like you that I&#039;ve ever met knows they waste a lot of money, and if they&#039;re willing to be honest with themselves, they already know what they&#039;re wasting it on. Most just aren&#039;t honest with themselves. So just... stop doing that shit. Cancel your half-dozen streaming subscriptions and your onlyfans subs. Knock it off with the takeout. Stop doing the expensive shit in life that isn&#039;t really making your life any better.

I have a brand new RTX 4080 FE and I&#039;m having some issues crashing to the desktop while playing games. This occurs across various titles but seems to be more prevalent in titles that are more demanding. Ray Tracing seems to help increase the likelihood of reproducing the issue but the problem doesn&#039;t seem to be exclusive to RT titles from what I can tell. <br><br>Only thing I can see regarding the crash is picrel. I&#039;ve done some googling but I seem to be the only one on the internet with this issue on a 4080 and none of the solutions I&#039;ve found have helped. The title that the issue is most reproducible is Portal RTX. Here are some of the troubleshooting steps I have tried:<br><br>DDU Nvidia and AMD drivers and reinstall Nvidia drivers with the Clean Install option. <br><br>Changed the power management mode to high performance mode on Nvidia Control Panel<br><br>Ran a memtest with no reported issues (everything also works fine with my old 5700 XT). <br><br>Use Nvidia&#039;s clean software tool to clean the installation and reinstalled drivers with a clean install option<br><br>Booted Windows in Clean Boot mode with only the Microsoft and Nvidia services running to ensure no software conflicts<br><br>Reseated all power connections and verified everything is properly seated. <br><br><br>I haven&#039;t reseated the actual card into the PCIe slot yet and I haven&#039;t reinstalled Windows yet. Those are my next steps if I can&#039;t figure out a solution. I also haven&#039;t tried an older driver version since I&#039;ve been mainly using Portal RTX to test and it won&#039;t run without the current driver installed. I&#039;ve opened a case with Nvidia and their level 2 guys are having me try some basic troubleshooting so I&#039;m holding off on a reinstall until I do some of their troubleshooting.

You can go out and buy a disc, but that&#039;s just a DRM license to confirm that you bought it and maybe it ships some parts of the game, but you have to actually install it first which requires an active internet connection... oh and if it&#039;s multiplayer?

Only used Euler a and put an additional challenge on myself by trying to use sd 2.1.<br><br>It&#039;s kind of unfortunate that img2img don&#039;t/can&#039;t when redrawn with outside software, have png chunks with their full genealogy.<br><br><a href=\"#p90756383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90756383</a><br>subarashii", "filename": "00032-3917295206", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673083779235432, "time": 1673083779, "md5": "u6U5AIG8XjXgrAsNU9PMog==", "fsize": 399072, "resto": 90755747}, {"no": 90756402, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)04:29:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90756397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90756397</a><br>roll back to old commit", "time": 1673083783, "resto": 90755747}, {"no": 90756404, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)04:29:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90755895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90755895</a><br>hellish picture", "time": 1673083792, "resto": 90755747}, {"no": 90756407, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)04:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90756383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90756383</a>", "filename": "1673083772131", "ext": ".png", "w": 944, "h": 944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673083797634831, "time": 1673083797, "md5": "+7brouoCRZ0Vt+Z8H42JGA==", "fsize": 862761, "resto": 90755747}, {"no": 90756408, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)04:30:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where should she go next?
