For the bills the model deems as relevant, the model drafts a letter to the sponsor of the bill in an attempt to persuade the congressperson to make changes to the proposed legislation. We use hundreds of ground-truth labels of the relevance of a bill to a company to benchmark the performance of the model, which outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common outcome of irrelevance. We also benchmark the performance of the previous OpenAI GPT-3 model (text-davinci-002), which was state-of-the-art on many language tasks until text-davinci-003 was released on November 28, 2022. The performance of text-davinci-002 is worse than simply always predicting that a bill is irrelevant to a company. These results suggest that, as large language models continue to exhibit improved core natural language understanding capabilities, performance on corporate lobbying related tasks will continue to improve.

Even in the best case of 0 padding, we wasted 3 bytes for the pointer, and 3-6 (depending on the scenario) bytes per size_t (9-15/24 bytes wasted, 37.5%-62.5%): even for an int32 vector, using a 32-bit size already allows up to 16GiB of data in the vector, which most machines nowadays cannot even contain. When using 40-bit sizes, even maximum-sized byte vectors would not fit on any reasonable contemporary machine, and such amounts of data require a very customised application design anyway and therefore, containers should not default to such sizes. For most reasonable cases, a 5 byte pointer and two 3-byte sizes would suffice to address all memory and contain up to 16Mi elements per collection in a 11-byte vector structure. Large collections of small objects, such as pixel data in high resolution images, should use specialised containers suited for larger counts. With our 11 bytes vector, we use only slightly more than a sixth of a cache line, while a C++ vector takes up more than a third, and in the worst case, the C++ vector wastes an additional 7 bytes of padding, resulting in a footprint of up to 31 bytes (e.g. in an opt&lt;vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;), while ours remains constant at 9/11/13/15 (2/3/4/5-byte size type). Most programs could even save space on the pointer because rarely does a program need more than 4GiB of RAM. We can thus reduce the size of data structures by up to 2-4 times merely by removing constaints on type sizes and alignment. This effectively doubles the amount of cache we can use.</span><br>let&#039;s have this discussion again.

When ProtonMail was being created the founders would frequently decline seed startup capital.

The attackers said 3 times they would stop the attack if ProtonMail CTO, Dr. Butler, apologized. Dr. Butler would not apologize for publicly mocking and goading the attacker, so the DDoS continued. ProtonMail tried to blame the DDoS attacks on Russia,[16] jumping onto the &quot;Just blame Russia&quot; bandwagon. Everyone who had the facts disagreed with ProtonMail&#039;s &quot;blame Russia&quot; approach, including their own contractor, Radware. As ProtonMail was trying to figure out where it was coming from, Krebsonsecurity came to the rescue and identified the attacker as an autistic teen living in the UK.[17] ProtonMail later credited him officially.

I can find very little fault other than the obvious nobasslmao preference. It still gives good detail and texture in the low end, just not at a quantity or slam-level that meets most tastes. Tonality from mids through upper treble is great. Natural and clear, but just stepped back in comparison to typical Moondrop/Salnotes Zero-esque presence. There is nothing I can remark on as inadequate or subpar in any realm of technicalities or mumbo jumbo, the driver sounds great, above average. I have no issues with channel imbalance in my pair. I can also hear why Final doubles down on marketing towards 3D/360 sound, it does excel at imaging and soundstage for the price and btfo&#039;d my own preconceived notions. I find them comfortable. You can play with insert depth easily with the different included tips, I went balls deep and they sound excellent. I rec em if you want low-bass dark treble, cheap imaging and soundstage, and simple comfy bullet-style.

Backlight is the illumination solution on a LCD: the lightsource that illuminates the panel  so they can be seen. The backlight is an essential part of an liquid crystal display, but useless on an e-reader; it can only function in the context of a complete liquid crystal display. e-ink is normally used in combination with a front light: the whole system is basically a light shining on top of the screen, or front light.

I am currently doing research into setting up my own  home server. I want to store movies, family photos and ebooks. Possibly even music down the road. Anyway I was researching plex and was under the impression I could just install the plex software on a PC and use that PC as a server. I have an older homebuilt PC that is running windows 7 I planned to use for this purpose. I was just now reading through the Home Server Wiki and it says i need a server OS. So do I need to wipe windows off the machine and install one of these server OS&#039;s? Or do they run off of windows? Or can I just set up a plex server using the Plex software like I saw in the YT vid I watched.

A graphics card can also be used for HW accelerated transcoding for media servers, or you can do things like pass one through to a VM. For instance I have a Windows VM with a card passed through, I sometimes use it when I don&#039;t need the full performance of my main desktop, or when I want to stream a game to some other place in my house.<br><br><a href=\"#p90696005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90696005</a><br>Undervolting your fucking server is not something I would ever recommend.

Notes are the most troublesome part to write, everything else you can automate or program. You can use your MIDI keyboard for drums too, so a drumpad is not essential at first. The less things you have to deal with at the beginning, the faster you&#039;re gonna learn. You&#039;re gonna have to trust me on this one. DAWs and virtual synths are an endless rabbit hole, and it&#039;s better to explore them first -a lot- and then see what hardware you need for your specific goals instead of the other way around. If you reach a point where you simply can&#039;t live without an extra fader or knob, you can customize your controllers with exactly what you need for a cheap buck or maybe during your learning curve save money to get that fancy controller of your dreams. You&#039;ll probably change your mind a couple of times while you learn, maybe you decide that the computer is not enough and go for a hybrid or full DAW-less setup. Go very slow on the spending because if you don&#039;t have a clear goal and buy the wrong thing, it can get pretty frustrating. It&#039;s also overwhelming to have a lot of stuff that you don&#039;t use.

The implication being that emphasizing traits found specifically in  sexually immature organizsms effectively makes them dumber and more docile. Which makes sense, because the sexually inactive members of species has to act subservient to the larger, more grown ones so they dont get killed. Coincidently, a lot of social engineering schemes since that study has included artifically extending child hood and creating scientific justifications for depriving people of their rights for longer periods of time.<br><br>The behaviors you learn as a teenager, carry with you into adulthood regardless of your legal-age-status. This means you can create a population of irresponsible manchildren/consoomers if you explicitly stiffle their mental and physical development during their teenage years. What people should focus on isn&#039;t an arbitrary age group but rather the personal rights and responsibilities said individual is expected to have/do by said age. <br><br>And whats weird is that we all fundementally know this to be true without saying so. You understand, as a mother or a father, or as a brother or a sister, that if  you let a younger relative act retarded, they are going to keep acting retarded. They do not &#039;grow up&#039; once they hit some random chronological number.

I caved in and finally bought my first Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen. This is now my most expensive fountain pen, at roughly 237 USD (after conversion). Despite the colour of the nib in the pic, it is an 18K gold nib but is coated with rhodium. I like the writing experience; it&#039;s very smooth but not overly smooth, as in it does have just the smallest touch of resistance/feedback/scratchy or whatever you wanna call it. <br><br>Reviews online have said that the metal parts of this pen are &quot;fingerprint magents&quot; but honestly in my experience it&#039;s nowhere near as bad. It&#039;s a lot of fingerprint resistant than the reviews make it out to be. What I find most surprising about this pen, however, is the fact that the grip section is somehow non-slippery, despite being all-metal. I rarely find myself having to re-adjust my fingers when gripping the grip section, even though my hands are often lotioned. Length of the pen without the cap is 126/127 mm, which is comfortable enough for me. Though I do think if it were just a teensy bit longer (like 130 mm), it would&#039;ve been perfect.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say about the pen is that you have to make sure the nib unit is properly saturated after filling, which can be done by expelling a drop of ink back into the bottle after refilling. First time I used by directly filling the converter, it had the rare and occasional problem of hard starting/skipping a bit at the start of a letter.

Software that is better in principle comes with everything you need. software that is inferior does not, and someone has to fill it in. They do it by building tools. Every third-party \u201ctool\u201d is actually a weakness: it\u2019s doing something that either didn\u2019t need to have been done at all, or could have been done better in the first place. however, it creates a community. There\u2019s a way for people to contribute. It\u2019s like a game that leaves little bonuses lying around for people to pocket. If even a novice can make a small contribution, so much better. They feel good about themselves, and now they\u2019ve made a commitment to that ecosystem. The switching costs suddenly became significantly higher. In the realm of programming languages, this is especially true. And in fact, to be \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of size, perhaps every language should start out somewhat flawed.. it should have bad scope rules, weird modules, funky overloading, floating points as the only numbers, and so on. To a rational observer, this might seem an awful idea. but programmers, as a species, have gotten acculturated to salt mines as a natural habitat. They will think nothing of it. Of course, you need something to draw them in: \u201cone weird trick\u201d that lets them do entirely unnecessary and perhaps wholly unwise things that let them demonstrate virtuosity. The latter draws them in, and the former seals the commitment. One could view C++ templates as a form of the latter.<br><br>Customers regard more highly an organization that has recovered well from failure than one that had not yet failed.

Especially when lisp came out in the 50&#039;s? Thus most would have baby ducked to it. Its because functional languages are too closely related to calculus and set theory and not enough to language. Functional language patterns expect verbs to memorize information about nouns because that makes sense in set theory when mapping between sets.

If you were to use his approach for something like ML you would require people to learn both lisp and the DSL that would come with tensor.

It was founded in 1911 (111 years ago), and since then it has developed a wide range of products and technologies that have had a significant impact on the technology industry and the world at large. Some examples of IBM&#039;s contributions include the development of the personal computer, the creation of the MVS operating system, and the development of productivity tools like Document Composition Facility (DCF).<br><br>IBM has a diverse range of products and services. In addition to its core products like TrueNorth (a neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit) and Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), IBM also has a strong presence in other areas of the technology industry, including cloud computing, digital workplace, cybersecurity, and hardware. This diversity allows IBM to offer a range of solutions to customers in different sectors, which can be a key advantage over companies that are more focused on a single area of the industry.<br><br>IBM has a strong financial position. With annual revenue over $57 billion and a market capitalization of over $127 billion and a long history of profitability, IBM is one of the most financially successful technology companies in the world. This financial strength gives IBM the resources it needs to invest in research and development, acquire other companies, and pursue new opportunities.<br><br>IBM has a strong corporate culture and commitment to corporate social responsibility.

How fast they drain depends on capacity of the battery and obviously on the current pulled from it, not on voltage. Any device designed for AA batteries should have a dropout voltage (i.e. when it turns off due to the batteries being dead) of about 0.9V per cell, since if the battery voltage has dropped that low then most of the energy stored in the cell has been extracted. This is an entirely appropriate voltage level for both alkaline AAs (non-rechargeable, 1.5V nominal) and also for NiMH (rechargeable, 1.2V nominal) because they have different discharge curves, as in the 1.5V alkalines start at higher voltage but have a steeper drop while NiMH start at lower voltage but don&#039;t drop quite as fast.

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br><br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br><br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.

Defeat the undead dragon in the Undead Burg, then make your way to the Bell of Awakening in the Undead Parish and ring it.<br>3. From there, you can either choose to head to the Lower Undead Burg and defeat the Capra Demon, or explore the rest of the Undead Parish and defeat the giant in the church to obtain the Lordvessel.<br>4. If you choose the latter option, you can then progress through Anor Londo and defeat the bosses there to obtain the Lordvessel.<br>5. Once you have the Lordvessel, you can then choose to either progress through Blighttown and defeat Quelaag, or make your way through the Darkroot Basin and defeat Sif to obtain the Covenant of Artorias.<br>6. Once you have either the Lordvessel or the Covenant of Artorias, you can then progress through Sen&#039;s Fortress and Anor Londo to defeat the final bosses and complete the game.<br><br>Again, this is just one way you could approach your first playthrough of Dark Souls.

As the other anon says, he&#039;s not making any comments about which upscaler is best for your specific use case, he&#039;s just pointing out that you&#039;re underestimating the GANs which sometimes really are the &quot;best&quot; option over latent. More detail is not automatically better, latent forces you to have more than about 0.6 denoising which means you&#039;re losing fidelity to the base image which might have minor features you value highly. The best way to demonstrate this to yourself is to generate a few dozen pics with hires fix turned off, pick a few you really like, then regenerate them with hires fix doubling them on Latent and on your upscaler of choice. The Latent ones will still look super nice and detailed, sure, but you&#039;ll find that since it departs significantly from the base image it sometimes chews up features you like. Also, the way it works on such fine detail means you&#039;re overly likely to end up with curly hair, intricate baroque style, etc without having asked for it. Yes, it&#039;s good, it&#039;s my favourite, but using a GAN upscaler also has its place (and works great down at 0.3 denoise or even lower)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related, see how obsessive latent gets with the buttons/belt loops? this issue is demonstrably repeatable, it&#039;s not a flat upgrade over GAN</span><br><br><a href=\"/g/thread/90687446#p90689544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90689544</a><br><a href=\"/g/thread/90687446#p90689572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90689572</a><br>It&#039;s literally just the tech from some instagram type face app for enhancing photos, 100% intended for selfies etc. So yeah it&#039;ll wreck anime and it&#039;s mixed at best even on realistic/concept art drawings.
