In many places it&#039;s basically impossible to create an account  or even join and this will just be a place to talk about something, they host no content and provide nothing else other than a place of discussion.

The first, more forgivable reason, was the fact that it used to be insanely slow. Ruby is still somewhat slow, but 1.x was on a whole different level. It felt sluggish even even doing trivial tasks. Eventually it got better but by then, the language was on the downswing.<br>The second, sadder reason is webdev.

In the end I gave up on the idea and settled for an iterated bootstrap scheme (you write a simple version of your language and pass it host functions, then you rewrite those host functions into machine code using your language, then you add increasing amounts of functionality... this also allows you to start with a trivial parser and to complexity it through the boostraps). It does leave a bitter taste in the mouth but with all the time I spent on this, that&#039;s the best I could do. My conclusion is that chuck moore is a true genius for having come up with forth, and that it cannot be improved whatsoever, which is why it still has stack acrobatics that hurt my personal use.<br><br>There are no other mindfuck languages once you&#039;re past smalltalk, lisp and forth except in the esolang scene. Things like nemerle can fuck with you in many ways, as can parallel languages and flowchart languages, but they also happen to be ludicrously complex in the backend, and sometimes also in the frontend by partial necessity.<br><br>Linked lists are always easy to implement. Stack (e.g. alloca) still limits you to stack size cutoff from the OS and good luck maintaining a few of those between calls. That said, since you name alloca, you shouldn&#039;t have a problem using realloc, so vectors should not be a problem. In asm you just write a simple malloc implementation: 1- check brk with current ptr 2- move the brk if needed, otherwise just push the pointer to the new size and return the old start. Done.

By combining two types of discrete speech representations, we cast TTS as a composition of two sequence-to-sequence tasks: from text to high-level semantic tokens (akin to &quot;reading&quot;) and from semantic tokens to low-level acoustic tokens (&quot;speaking&quot;). Decoupling these two tasks enables training of the &quot;speaking&quot; module using abundant audio-only data, and unlocks the highly efficient combination of pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for parallel data when training the &quot;reading&quot; component. To control the speaker identity, we adopt example prompting, which allows SPEAR-TTS to generalize to unseen speakers using only a short sample of 3 seconds, without any explicit speaker representation or speaker-id labels. Our experiments demonstrate that SPEAR-TTS achieves a character error rate that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods using only 15 minutes of parallel data, while matching ground-truth speech in terms of naturalness and acoustic quality, as measured in subjective tests.", "time": 1675870972, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91410780, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:44:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410706</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP is entirely tortoise</span><br>Retard", "time": 1675871046, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91410854, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410780</a><br>Hey it is one of many options.", "time": 1675871413, "resto": 91410682}, {"no": 91411060, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:02:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91410682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410682</a><br>Great bake OP, better than the shill split attempt thread, they won&#039;t stop and have to ruin it for everyone.<br><a href=\"#p91410780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91410780</a><br>so that&#039;s the shill game plan this time, try to subvert anons away from tortoise, got it.

Dataset<br>Currently code expect dataset to be in form of image jpg,jpeg,webp,png and accompanying json file that contains tags i.e danbooru dataset. Currently it&#039;s hardcoded and will be used as example one for that guide.<br>Sqlite db is stored in repo as index of files, and files served from linode bucket in pairs, there is check in code to discard non paired images. During training, both image and json are fetched, and from json extracted only description tags and saved as txt file alongside image in workplace directory.<br>2. Mother node<br>Currently it expects to have GPU and will be part of the swarm. For distributed training you also need configuration in next step.<br>3. Relay mode<br>Next step is to set up relay configuration in UI, that will allow your node to serve config endpoint to peers - from wich they will be able to grab config, for that purprose I.E port are used. So if you behind NAT it makes sense to portforward port 80 to your internal I.E port, TCP ports are used for DHT connections so as well needed to be portforwarded, and your public ip will be used as DHT server, so that ip (or domain name ) you can spread among peers so they would be able to join swarm.<br>If you are NOT behind NAT, put matching pairs of ports here, so advertised and listened ports are matched and that will do the trick.<br>4.

In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one-to-many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms.

It accidentally works really well for our use cases.<br>You can have separate compose files btw - I split mine into software categories.

That&#039;s not a secure platform and from my experience in dealing with medical records data, most Dr offices are avoiding using email due to HIPAA regulations and security risks. Only talk to a medical office over the phone or in person, even if they offer communication over email. Same goes for text, nothing over SMS. <br>My opinion on username for personal email address, is the same system I&#039;ve always recommended in this thread and others on /g/, take your initials and convert to hexadecimal. In most cases you&#039;ll have a unique 6 character alphanumeric name that no one else has already taken (unless it&#039;s Gmail which you shouldn&#039;t use to begin with). <br>The reason why I&#039;m saying don&#039;t use PII in email is because even if it&#039;s just for &quot;normie&quot; stuff, it don&#039;t matter.
