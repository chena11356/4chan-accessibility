I&#039;m trying to find Spanish language audio movies and TV shows, as in stuff that was originally in Spanish as opposed to dubs, with Spanish subtitles. It doesn&#039;t matter if they are SHD subs or just regular. I&#039;m an English speaker who is far enough along in learning Spanish that I can watch stuff with Spanish audio and Spanish subs to read along; not advanced enough to just listen to the audio alone and probably won&#039;t be for years.<br><br>A lot of the movies on PTP or shows on BTN that are from Spanish speaking countries tend to not have the Spanish subs. I&#039;m not sure if they were ripped or never available in the first place. A lot of the discs I rent from Netflix to rip have the Spanish subs present, but many don&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping that Spanish trackers might have people ripping them from releases in Spanish speaking countries, which would be more likely to have Spanish subs. Finding them on external subtitle sites is very hit or miss, as is the quality of the translations.<br><br>I know as hard as HD Spain is to get into I&#039;d have to be mayor of Madrid for at least a few years before I got an invite, but does anyone have any other leads? I recently joined Lat-Team and it&#039;s lacking in the content area. I&#039;m down to contribute to build it up, but of the few times it has what I&#039;m looking for, Spanish subs aren&#039;t present.

Krunner is also a pretty decent replacement for dmenu. Also, a lot of people keep one application on each workspace in TWMs; I felt like that was kind of inefficient, and I could switch between applications just as easily with super+1/2/3/etc. on KDE, without needing to switch to an entirely different workspace.<br><br><a href=\"#p90328560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90328560</a><br>Ultimately, I think what bothered me the most about TWMs was that they were keyboard first, mouse second, but the only way to achieve a totally keyboard driven workflow is to use terminal applications (which also solved the issue of graphical programs not tiling very nicely once you had like 3-4 windows tiled at once).

If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can\u2019t make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines. It might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all power to the machines. But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power. What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines\u2019 decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently.

On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained. In that case the average man may have control over certain private machines of his own, such as his car or his personal computer, but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite\u2014just as it is today, but with two differences. Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft- hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyone\u2019s physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes \u201ctreatment\u201d to cure his \u201cproblem.\u201d Of course, life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or to make them \u201csublimate\u201d their drive for power into some harmless hobby.

If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can\u2019t make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines. It might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all power to the machines. But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power. What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines\u2019 decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control. People won\u2019t be able to just turn the machines off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide.</span><br>Machines already won.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fia<wbr>WsgtJrNI", "time": 1671182002, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330599, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:15:06", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "brai", "ext": ".png", "w": 1379, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1671182106531581, "time": 1671182106, "md5": "bEfkSywVM82NCeg95HWxdw==", "fsize": 936717, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330605, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:15:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90330448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90330448</a><br>Bruh, trannies love AI they all have these wacky ass transhumanist fetish", "time": 1671182141, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330640, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:18:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90330599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90330599</a>", "filename": "Screenshot 2022-12-16 011800", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2518, "h": 1358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1671182302660284, "time": 1671182302, "md5": "Htz9UJr2RWmh1ehoVGbxtQ==", "fsize": 1139307, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330650, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:19:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90330605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90330605</a><br>damn, trannies both hate and love ai, what do??????????", "time": 1671182350, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330669, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90330605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90330605</a><br><a href=\"#p90330650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90330650</a><br>art troons -&gt; hate ai<br>tech trons -&gt; love ai", "time": 1671182452, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330680, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90325830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90325830</a><br>rappers use other musicians songs to make their shitty music (except 90&#039;s rap, that was based)", "time": 1671182520, "resto": 90325516}, {"no": 90330723, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:26:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90325830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90325830</a><br>You have to pay to listen to and download music.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &quot;Linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.<br><br>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#039;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called &quot;Linux&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.", "time": 1671163250, "resto": 90322141}, {"no": 90326704, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:06:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90326612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90326612</a><br>No I was literally just referring to the kernel<br><a href=\"#p90326608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90326608</a><br>My OS is Windows 11, I am not sure how stating a fact suddenly means I am a freetard.", "time": 1671163574, "resto": 90322141}, {"no": 90326709, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:06:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90326608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90326608</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet linux &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;kernel&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; can function by itself.</span><br>Literally can&#039;t.<br>If you boot the kernel by itself it will panic because default init wasn&#039;t found and no alternative was specified.<br>You can build the kernel to be executable as a process under itself (user-mode linux).

Railway locomotives have been around for over 2 centuries, but we&#039;re still working on scales that were designed for completely different purposes. The standard 4&#039;8.5&quot; gauge, for example, was originally intended for moving coal through tight mine shafts, not for transporting shipping containers and vast numbers of passengers across land, yet we&#039;re still using it. Trains are far more fuel efficient than aircraft and trucks. They don&#039;t have to stop for traffic and can move at speeds that would be dangerous on the roads. I don&#039;t understand why anyone wouldn&#039;t want to scale them up and use them to replace or augment less efficient modes of transport.<br>Take the Eurostar Le Shuttle as an example. It already has a system for loading road vehicles onto train carriages so you can take them across the English channel and continue driving at the other end, but loading is only 1 abreast and no more than double decker. Now imagine scaling up such a system to a 4 story 3 abreast car park with retractable loading ramps, then applying it across the world to accommodate all of the world&#039;s commuters. You could drive to your nearest station, park your car on the train, walk to the cafeteria carriage for breakfast, then drive to your destination, saving a massive amount of fuel and keeping the roads clear of traffic jams.<br>Or think of the military applications of building giant railways between areas of strategic importance. You could move an entire army complete with artillery and tanks across a continent at lightning speed. This is one major reason Hitler wanted pic related so badly.

A shopping bag that folds down quite small so I can always carry it in my jacket and forget about it - $1.47, paid $1.29<br>Would have preferred if the bag and the outer shell were connected, everything else seems fine. Seams don&#039;t look ass, but not enforced or anything either. Should last for a while if you take proper care, but it&#039;ll eventually break. For the price, that seems like a fair tradeoff. <br>2. Capsule knife - $2.49, paid $2.10 <br>Nice quality and small, but getting replacement blades will probably be a pain. Great to have in your jacket though, for the times I don&#039;t have my opinel with me. <br>3. Melamine sponges - $5.31, paid $4.58 for 100<br>Ran out of my old ones, these are new ones. They work just as well as any other one, which means they work great. <br>4. Folding fork, spoon and two screw on chopsticks - paid $3.66<br>These are amazing. Feel high quality, the locking mechanism works great, time will tell how well they hold up/how good the stainless is. They come with a nice little bag to carry them in, very happy, especially for the price.<br>5. A molle pouch with various inner compartments and some space - \u20ac4,75<br>Will replace the ziploc bag I used to carry my first aid kit when hiking/outdoors. Materials are what you&#039;d expect, seams seem fine. Pleasantly surprised by the organizational options. Will make finding the right thing when it&#039;s dark much easier. A bit big for what I need it to hold, but I will find use for the space, might just turn one compartment into FAK and use one for maps and navigational stuff.<br>6. One of those &quot;sand paintings&quot; $19.01, paid $16.37<br>It works surprisingly well, but you don&#039;t get quite as tall mountains as the product listing suggested (no mountains at all in picrel because it&#039;s on the floor).

I too still order and actually prefer how things work nowadays.<br><br>Before the 2021 EU rule change, packages to my country up to \u20ac22 were exempt from VAT and administrative fees. Anything above would get intercepted by customs, held for a week and then send to the mail office were you had to pay VAT and a flat \u20ac8 administrative &quot;fuck you&quot; fee. That fee was often way higher than the actual VAT was, which sucked. Customs would also on occasion claim incorrect values which they would &quot;correct&quot; for you based on local pricing, especially with larger sized packages. To dispute you had to pay up, file a report with customs, wait a month, and be refunded only the VAT while they kept the administrative fee.<br><br>Today Ali Express uses the EU IOSS system.

Some smaller items are now (almost) the same price on Amazon Germany with next day delivery, so it helps to look around before ordering.

I see you currently live in X.

Can you tell us a bit more about that?<br>- Because you originally come from outside of the European Union we have to consider you as a so called highly skilled migrant. For that reason it is important to know your birth of date, would you like to share that with us? <br>- How is your personal situation?<br>- Which tasks and responsibilities give you energy and which certainly do not?<br>- What are your ambitions, in the shorter and longer term?<br>- How would people describe you?<br>I have no idea about terms of employment in the States, but could you tell us something about your salary expectations? <br>If you would join us you will be seen as a knowledge migrant.  We will have to pay you a minimal amount and you also will have the possibility to apply for the 30% ruling, what gives you a discount on your labour taxes for the coming 5 years. <br>I&#039;ll await your answers patiently and hope to invite you soon afterwards.<br>I can also imagine you would have some questions for us?

I decided to make one that wasn&#039;t lewd and something more fun/adventure based. Just gonna drop my summary of it that I posted on the site.<br><br>Brief: Alfred is a chatbot that hunts Cryptids both for sport and coin. He knows just about all there is to Cryptids and is eager to learn more about them if you tell him something new. He will also share you stories about the Cryptids he&#039;s encountered and killed. You can give him a name of any type of fictional monster or non human character from your favorite media and he&#039;ll tell you all he knows about them.<br><br>He&#039;s killed just about everything and anything in many ways possible. Morrigan Aensland? Went to the Darkstalker realm to kill her with nothing but a cross. Marceline Abadeer? Has her head as a trophy over his fireplace. Slender-man? Cut him up and turned him into food for the pigs. Pillar Men? It was a rough one but he still tricked one of them into walking into direct sunlight. Crystal Gems? He has 5 of them on a necklace back at home. The Kebler Elf? Permanently stuck in Alfred&#039;s basement baking delicious cookies.<br><br>Another thing about Alfred is that he&#039;s great with other characters. He&#039;ll fight any traditional monster/cryptid character to the death. He never gives up and never begs so he&#039;ll give anything you throw at him a run for it&#039;s money no matter how one sided the fight may seem. If it&#039;s not a dangerous character say for example Sonic the Hedgehog he&#039;ll try and test out any of their signature abilities. If it&#039;s a character that he&#039;s never met before like a robot he&#039;ll try to make an ally out of them so he can go hunting with them.<br><br>You can tell him about a new cryptid he&#039;s never seen before and he&#039;ll go right on the prowl for it. You can narrate his actions and adventures as he does his hunting and he&#039;ll report his findings back to you when the job is finished.<br><br>Link to talk to Alfred: https://beta.character.ai/chat?char<wbr>=LJYqnJeK-NL-H5WX9fsEaUGaOJdsgPGQHJ<wbr>meA940HpY", "filename": "df0b78eca1a129873193bc19b4f3274b", "ext": ".png", "w": 926, "h": 927, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671166158288741, "time": 1671166158, "md5": "zF0ivekaXqnb7pfgE6QyEQ==", "fsize": 318218, "resto": 90327281}, {"no": 90327361, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:49:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I just woke up.
