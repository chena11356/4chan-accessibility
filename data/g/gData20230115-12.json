Maybe we should have one type that abstracts the idea of &quot;this is for communicating with OS APIs and we don&#039;t care what encoding it is&quot;, and one type for &quot;this is for general use and we&#039;re going go use the same encoding on all platforms&quot;.<br><br>Okay, great, but we have other questions now. Should all strings be stored on the heap? What about strings that are embedded in the binary, like string literals? Heap strings need to be freed, but string literals are read only.

The real question you should be asking is how the format_args macro is implemented. And the answer to that is... it&#039;s a compiler built-in! Although it probably doesn&#039;t really need to be given the improvements Rust has had in the capabilities of macros, I can only guess that it&#039;s a performance optimization. What that format_args macro is going to do though is turn everything into a core::fmt::Arguments struct... which is internal to the standard library, and constructing one on your own without the macro is not considered stable.

They agreed to break the law at the time by signing a secret agreement to divide the land, a local People&#039;s Commune, into family plots. Each plot was to be worked by an individual family who would turn over some of what they grew to the government and the collective whilst at the same time agreeing that they could keep the surplus for themselves. The villagers also agreed that should one of them be caught and sentenced to death that the other villagers would raise their children until they were eighteen years old.[5][6] At the time, the villagers were worried that another famine might strike the village after a particularly bad harvest and more people might die of hunger.[6]</span><br><br>    &gt;After this secret capitalist reform, Xiaogang village produced a harvest that was larger than the previous five years combined.[5] Per capita income in the village increase from 22 yuan to 400 yuan with grain output increasing to 90,000 kg in 1979.[6] This attracted significant attention from surrounding villages and before long the government in Beijing had found out. The villagers were fortunate in that at the time China had just changed leadership after Mao Zedong had died. The new leadership under Deng Xiaoping was looking for ways to reform China&#039;s economy and the discovery of Xiaogang&#039;s innovation was held up as a model to other villages across the country. This led to the abandonment of collectivised farming across China and a large increase in agricultural production.

The first stage, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the de-collectivization of agriculture, the opening up of the country to foreign investment, and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses. However, a large percentage of industries remained state-owned. The second stage of reform, in the late 1980s and 1990s, involved the privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry. The 1985 lifting of price controls[7] was a major reform, and protectionist policies and regulations soon followed, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). The private sector grew remarkably, accounting for as much as 70 percent of China&#039;s gross domestic product by 2005.[8] From 1978 until 2013, unprecedented growth occurred, with the economy increasing by 9.5% a year.<br><br>    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_econo<wbr>mic_reform", "filename": "chinese economic reforms", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1993, "h": 2733, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673767791709093, "time": 1673767791, "md5": "zQrHiaeBrl+DNDLjVwRT8A==", "fsize": 680856, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905339, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905320</a><br><a href=\"#p90905334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905334</a><br>not reading", "time": 1673767820, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905365, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:34:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905320</a><br>I also watched that Lex Friedman interview", "time": 1673768081, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905371, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:34:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90905339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90905339</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not reading</span><br>didn&#039;t ask", "filename": "", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 250, "h": 250, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673768096570020, "time": 1673768096, "md5": "iFgTrCwUBg+1edBl1UaLIw==", "fsize": 6722, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905389, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90902063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90902063</a><br>thats a poo, not paki", "time": 1673768184, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905481, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90901854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90901854</a><br>capital accumulation", "time": 1673768918, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905534, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)02:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90901906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90901906</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;maths</span>", "time": 1673769401, "resto": 90901854}, {"no": 90905650, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)03:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Shareholders wanted more money.

Now you&#039;ve basically reinvented HTML+CSS+JS. Did you do a better job? Maybe. And then you&#039;ve got to network all this, and it&#039;s obviously going to have to be p2p since lets face it, it&#039;ll never be popular enough for a server ecosystem to make sense. Best way to do that is a DHT, maybe a skipgraph, you&#039;ve now reinvented DNS, but much slower and more complicated since it needs to run on normal machines and not optically accelerated ASICs.<br>Lets say you finish it, you&#039;ve got your perfect networked searchable all lisp ecosystem you can hook into from any computer anywhere in the world. How do you run programs not written in lisp? Now you&#039;ve got to make untold amounts of libraries, hooks, boilerplate, etc... all in multiple other languages across lots of architectures just to attempt running the stuff.<br> <br>Meanwhile, WASM already runs in browsers, it&#039;s based on sexps, operates off the normal internet, runs on all platforms, and works as a compilation target for all existing languages so old software can be directly compiled into WASM and run both in the browser and directly on bare metal. All the work has already been done, you can go try it out right now.<br> <br>Obviously the answer is to take WASM and use it to build your lisp ecosystem idea, but currently it doesn&#039;t have GC or memory management, so everyone&#039;s stuck in limbo waiting for the ability for the ability of modules to create and execute other modules.

That said, I am very aware these are different flavors of the same thing.  I have worked a lot with zmq and redis, but there are some real annoyances with using them(redis is bloated and single threaded, written in a language I don&#039;t care for, while zmq has bizzarre quirks like not being able to set a timeout on a poll request without having to fire some kind of notify event to release the socket in the form of some dummy message that tells it to quit waiting which is janky and annoying and eats cpu cycles pointlessly doing networking it doesn&#039;t need to do)  That&#039;s precisely why I came to 4chan to ask about alternatives.  I think memchached may be decent for a caching server for the unencrpyted data on the backend, but I am still unsure it&#039;s the best and I don&#039;t know what to use for the actually light weight coms protocol.  <br><br>2) I want to be able to send packets over my network and other networks using existing hardware.  This means I will need something cross platform that manage to do UDP connections at the bare minimum.  A nice feature of zmq is it can also do stuff like pub-sub so you can have many to one connections.  I find needing many to many connections is unlikely for my use cases though as I am not trying to build a distributed system(at least not a decentralized one, as I scale up I plan to have a few load balancing relays to pass the data to a backend if needed once I get to a size where that matter, if it ever matters.  as far as your comment about a clothes stack, sure I&#039;ll humour you.

I have had it carry three laptops but usually with me is my work macbook pro, a lot of cables for different things, a gozero sherpa powerbank with 60W of type c power output, a mouse and whatever shit I might need. It can expand by opening up a zipper that compresses it so I can put in a jacket if I need to but I try to keep it just for the computer and accessories, everything I need and might need. it has backpack straps too that hide in the back. Useful if it turns out I have to carry it for a longer time.<br><br>The 2 day assault is my daily driver backpack when I&#039;m bringing my personal PC and camera with me. It&#039;s very EDC focused so it has a good padded laptop pocket with easy access and a lot of other storage options.

It hardly shows any signs of wear even though I&#039;ve used it a lot.<br><br>The largest is the Komodo Dragon and it&#039;s great for when I&#039;m travelling. It&#039;s more mil gear so it doesn&#039;t have a laptop pocket but I don&#039;t tend to use this backpack when I travel with a laptop. It can carry it, but this is more like a do-it-all for hiking and stuff. I like to use this when riding with my motorcycle as I often need the capacity. As for quality compared to the 2 day assault, there is not much difference. It&#039;s stronger and bigger but how well the 2 day performs, it&#039;s hard to justify buying this.

Look around for what appeals to you. <br>As for proper things that I got from Ali that actually made my room nicer:<br>- Led strips, preferably Bluetooth or WLAN compatible. It&#039;s a bit basic, but I like the look anyways. Attach to the back or underside of a desk/shelf for indirect light. <br>- &quot;Fairy lights&quot; give a comfy winter feeling. I have one around my desk and a solar one in my plants at the window. Even got one on the balcony.<br>- a led strip with a movement sensor under the bed so you can turn it on/off with your foot. Nice if you want to go to the toilet at night without turning the whole light on to wake up.<br>- comfy blankets and pillows. Pillows for bed/sofa, blanket on a chair.<br>- Your can get some rope hangers for plant pots for a good price if you like hanging plants.<br>- organizers keep clutter out of the way. I particularly like drawers that go in the PCs CD bay<br>- there&#039;s some pretty neat organizers for saving space in the closet for clothes<br>- cable organizers for clutter<br>- If you like the aesthetic there&#039;s sheet metal posters you can put on walls. Pictures are usually not worth it, posters may be if you like them. <br>- other than that it depends on your style. If you like the &quot;hoarding weeb&quot; aesthetic, get shelves to display figurines. If you want it more feminine, a lot of whites, pelts, lights (fairly lights are good), and wall art with fake motivational texts. Personally I quite like the &quot;french country home&quot; aesthetic for my kitchen (a lot of wood, metal and rustic things, generally a very open kitchen instead of clean cabinets) and a more industrial sleeping room.

However, if I&#039;m browsing through my code and making changes here and there, I find that it&#039;s less clunky to just scroll with the mouse wheel and click directly where I need to go with the mouse, rather than typing &quot;14j, wwwww&quot; or &quot;/foo, nnnn&quot;. A nice thing is that a lot of useful vim commands can be done entirely with your left hand (dd, cw, C, ea, and so on), so I can use the mouse for broad movements and my left hand to perform some kind of operation.

This left many people unemployed and angry.[4]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Luddite movement began in Nottingham in England and culminated in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816.[5] Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed with legal and military force, which included execution and penal transportation of accused and convicted Luddites.[6] </span><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddi<wbr>te", "time": 1673751422, "resto": 90901123}, {"no": 90902522, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:57:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90902424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90902424</a><br>ah ok<br><br><a href=\"#p90902454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90902454</a><br>oh yeah &quot;squatting on a large chair&quot; is good but it does seem to make the chairs fucky and isn&#039;t at all what i&#039;d call consistent lol", "filename": "squatting in a chair", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2880, "h": 960, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 41, "tim": 1673751451309821, "time": 1673751451, "md5": "a7hVomTr0YtGEFswrFje6g==", "fsize": 937493, "resto": 90901123}, {"no": 90902537, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)21:58:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90902364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90902364</a><br>Not out of the realm of possibilities, a blanket ban is unlikely, 1st A should prevent ban on certain type of art but tech companies can enforce something like that easily and they&#039;ve been proven to work with government when it comes to censorship and deplatforming.

FYI I do test my IEMs with music and FPS game (Rainbow Six Siege)<br>1) Tripowin x HBB Olina SE: Top of the line dynamic driver. Will offer speedy sound with great layering/separation ability. Slightly above average videogame audio performance. The bass is on the lighter side, but not in any distracting way, still present and natural.<br>2) A planar magnetic IEM. For my money, Shuoer S12 Pro, Tangzu Zetian Wu (Heyday optional), or Tinhifi P1 MAX are good choices at affordable prices. Speaking as owner of S12 Pro and P1 MAX, they have great videogame audio tracking performance. Offer a wide soundstage and pinpoint sound tracking ability in front, behind, L/R, above and below in ways that many cheaper dynamic drivers and middle-tier hybrid IEMs struggle to provide. Why placed below Olina SE? I firmly believe that planars do not sound optimal with lower-end dongles/DACs. Only with better gear like a Dawn/Space via balanced do they sound their best, so this is a qualifying factor.<br>3) QKZ x HBB with EQ. Not a joke, this $20 model performs admirably in videogames, offering a good soundstage where you can track sounds accurately. It&#039;s weakness is in the tuning when you desire cleaner mids, as it has lots of bass and midbloat. This can be EQ&#039;d out, which reveals that the driver is pretty well performing across the board.", "time": 1673735645, "resto": 90878167}, {"no": 90899040, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:44:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it worth getting any expensive iems over 100 if I&#039;m listening mostly to metal and electronic music?

First track specifically a few differences between Letshuoer S12 Pro and Tinhifi P1 MAX. I am not music expert so please excuse if I get instrument class wrong. <br><br>I prefer the way brass/wind and string instruments sound on P1 MAX because they retain a more natural timbre. There is a slight honky/plastic-y timbre in the treble of S12 Pro. Also at higher frequency, there is some sharpness with the S12 Pro that I do not feel with the P1 MAX. Difference of individual hearing/ears, this &quot;sharpness&quot; can maybe equate to &quot;bright, detailed&quot; for you. To reiterate, not crazy sibilant, but some extra energy in the upper frequencies with S12 Pro. You mention KZ ZSN, S12 Pro is more refined than that.<br><br>S12 Pro wins bass and drums. A more vibrant, engaging thump especially 3:30-4:30 when listening with the S12 Pro. Same applies to bass throughout rest of song, S12 Pro is deeper reaching, more full-bodied bass. The bass plays well in P1 MAX, but not to a similar level of engagement and oomph.<br><br>Both sets deliver nicely separated L/R imaging, distinct instrument separation and layering. Never encounter &quot;cloudy, obscured, messy&quot; sensation. All sounds play clean and distinct.<br><br>Tough to definitively rec one set based on this track listening. To further complicate your decision (haha sorry), consider the Tangzu Zetian Wu (and Heyday edition) and it will have it&#039;s own little quirks, pros and cons. The S12 Pro and Heyday specifically come with swappable cables so you are ready right away to listen via 2.5/3.5/4.4mm connection if you do get a new DAC with balanced connection. Ordering from Amazon is a nice way to try a set and if you really have issues with it, returning is easier than with other retailers.

The biggest is underestimating how much time you need to finish a decent game, much less an engine. You were probably thinking of making one at some point, right? Well take that estimate and multiply it by 50. Yes, no exaggeration, it&#039;s simply that big of a project. And estimating the complexity of an engine is 10 times worse. Factor in limited motivation and you&#039;re really only left with 2 realistic choices: never making a game ever or using all the shortcuts you can. Yes, you&#039;re probably imagining how easy it is to write a 20 liner to render an image or a 40 liner for displaying a 3d model in opengl and thinking &quot;durrr it can&#039;t be THAT bad&quot;. But it is. It&#039;s hard to explain. You don&#039;t think it be like that but it do. Another reason is underestimating how fast modern hardware is. On one hand, you probably share the notion that modern software is too bloated and can be done better. But you&#039;re again forced to make a choice here: spending years learning to optimize your shit and probably lose interest in the whole thing thus, again, never making anything, or making SOMETHING that actually works at full speed on 95% machines anyway, within a reasonable time frame. One more is underestimating how flexible modern game engines are. You can really do any game you want in them. You just need to learn if you can&#039;t see that.<br>Basically, it&#039;s an issue of making actually realistic choices that have actually good odds of coming true. Obviously, in a perfect world, you would make everything from scratch, and your ebin multiplayer open world harvest moon/pokemon roguelike with voxel graphics and procedural everything would run on a toaster and you&#039;d be crowned king of videogames.
