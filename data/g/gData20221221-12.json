Many forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, are deeply personal and are used as a way for the artist to express their emotions and experiences. AI, on the other hand, is incapable of experiencing emotions in the same way that humans do, and therefore cannot convey those emotions through its art. AI art lacks originality and creativity. While AI can certainly be programmed to produce art that is visually appealing, it is ultimately limited by the parameters set by its creators. It cannot think outside of the box or come up with truly original ideas in the same way that a human artist can.<br>Additionally, the role of the artist in the creation of art is an important factor in determining whether or not it is considered true art. The artist plays a crucial role in the creative process, choosing the subject matter, the medium, and the style in which the art is created. With AI art, the artist is not actively involved in the creation of the art, but rather serves more as a facilitator, programming the AI to produce the art. This lack of active participation in the creative process could be seen as diminishing the value of the art as true art.It is also worth considering the cultural and historical context in which art is created and appreciated. Art has long been a reflection of the society and culture in which it is created, and the artist&#039;s personal experiences and emotions often play a significant role in the art they create. AI lacks the personal experiences and cultural context that are often integral to the creation and appreciation of art.", "time": 1671602906, "resto": 90426098}, {"no": 90427042, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:09:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90427022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90427022</a><br>not that anon but my best tweets have been when americans are awake", "time": 1671602946, "resto": 90426098}, {"no": 90427045, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:09:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90427032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90427032</a><br>go back <a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/ic/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/ic/</a>", "time": 1671602951, "resto": 90426098}, {"no": 90427046, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:09:23", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1671602922433", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 738, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1671602963892741, "time": 1671602963, "md5": "qtlzeLYwvGxdGC0N25JJMQ==", "fsize": 52601, "resto": 90426098}, {"no": 90427052, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:10:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90427046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90427046</a><br>WTF?

The accuracy of machine learning and various AI has already been above 99% for a long damn time as far as technology goes. The existing problems that were holding this sort of AI back - overfitting to certain characteristics in the data, vanishing gradients, exploding gradients, the need for pre-labeled data, the ability to have unsupervised learning - have largely already been solved, a long damn time ago.

It gives you a pipe into which you can push as much data as you want and the other end will receive it perfectly. TCP will automatically split the data into packets, number them, retransmit the packets which didn&#039;t arrive on the other end, control congestion, handle connection timeouts, etc. It&#039;s a very convenient protocol. In contrast, UDP is a very thin abstraction over IP. You just fire off a packet of limited size and UDP doesn&#039;t care whether it arrives. There&#039;s also no concept of a connection in UDP.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when would you use UDP over TCP?</span><br>When you want to handle things yourself, usually in latency-sensitive applications. If a packet in the middle fails to arrive, TCP will pause the whole stream and wait until it&#039;s successfully retransmitted so that the data stays perfect. Sometimes you don&#039;t want that and you don&#039;t care if some data is lost, you just care about speed. For example, in a video call you may want to just ignore a frame that failed to arrive and display the next one. TCP would also be a poor idea for a fast-paced FPS game.", "time": 1671549534, "resto": 90406937}, {"no": 90412821, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)10:20:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90412747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90412747</a><br>If it&#039;s a homework/exam question, then you&#039;ll have to solve it the way the course teaches.

Grunt was a mischievous little creature, with a love of all things shiny and valuable. He spent most of his days scampering through the forest, searching for treasures to add to his hoard.<br><br>One day, Grunt came across a small pile of shekels, a type of coin used in the kingdom as a form of currency. Grunt had never seen shekels before, but he could tell by their shiny appearance and the weight in his hand that they were valuable.<br><br>Without hesitation, Grunt snatched up the shekels and hurried back to his lair to hide them away with the rest of his hoard. As he counted and admired his new treasure, Grunt couldn&#039;t help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.<br><br>But Grunt&#039;s joy was short-lived, as he soon realized that the shekels were actually the property of a wealthy merchant who had lost them on his way through the forest. The merchant, enraged at the loss of his precious coins, offered a hefty reward for their return.<br><br>Grunt knew that he couldn&#039;t keep the shekels, and with a heavy heart, he returned them to the merchant, who was overjoyed at their recovery. In gratitude, the merchant offered Grunt a small portion of the reward, which Grunt gratefully accepted.<br><br>From that day on, Grunt learned the value of honesty and the importance of returning lost items to their rightful owners.

Actual fuzz pedals aren&#039;t that expensive either and most guitar players would rather use physical equipment, so the market for it isn&#039;t very big either.<br>If you want a good fuzz, distortion or overdrive pedal vst first make sure the plugin has oversampling to avoid aliasing and then just demo it to listen to the sound. <br>Just as an example, I have Amplitube 5 and while the amps there are great, the Proco Rat emulation that comes with it (I forget its name) is absolutely awful.<br>It&#039;s been a while since I went on a demo spree for this stuff but the Nembrini stuff sounded pretty good to me and some of their stuff is free on their website.

You might find some Big Muff emulations and from what I can recall none of them feel like the real thing. I remember two freebie ones called Fuzzplus and Pig Pie, the former had significant amounts of aliasing and the latter I don&#039;t remember much, probably because it didn&#039;t sound good, but you should definitely check them out anyway.

Nice keyboards that clunk when you press them, making bleep bloop sounds that can eventually become music, flashing lights and making pictures out of little squares. <br><br>And then when studying computer architecture, it was cool how you (dis)organized everything is. You have a bunch of parts (alu, registers, counters) that do random shit alone, but together make the computer run.  You use special codes to map routes through all the parts, and then use tricks to make the routes faster (using shift-left-logic can be faster than multiplying). But then speed is constrained by how long an instruction takes, so you have the computer reorder parts of your code so all the parts are in use, but nothing is overwriting each other. Not only that, but circuit outputs aren&#039;t instantaneous, so you have to wait until the output settles down (think of debouncing in a push button) to get the proper output. Furthermore, since jumping around a program takes time, you build more circuits that guess when the jump will occur (branch prediction), so you can &quot;plan&quot; for it and get everything ready. <br><br>And then you learn that all this shit you learned was outdated in the &#039;70s and everything is way faster and complex today (there&#039;s even a measurement called &quot;million instructions per second&quot; that&#039;s been surpassed a long time ago)", "filename": "BBCMUG_0000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 219, "h": 309, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671576831765229, "time": 1671576831, "md5": "hOfAQ8PjNFRKAUfBUSHsZA==", "fsize": 21743, "resto": 90416554}, {"no": 90420592, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90419682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90419682</a><br>relatable", "filename": "awesome", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 960, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671577220633825, "time": 1671577220, "md5": "Nr7cXSHfUm6v+bUTNCFV6w==", "fsize": 471646, "resto": 90416554}, {"no": 90420618, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:01:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Autism.

If you don&#039;t care about the paper that certifies you, you can just go watch the lectures, take notes and do the homework without paying for shit. I&#039;d suggest that since this is the best way to learn for most people. Alternatively you can find something that suits you better like watching youtube lectures but you&#039;d have to be careful not to fall out of schedule. For example if it&#039;s one lecture per week always watch it a specific time that suits you like Saturday morning or something. You could also self study by using the books for each subject if that suits you better. If you don&#039;t know what to study then check the courses offered by the big unis (you can find them in their websites) and follow what they are doing on your own. You can use them to see which topics to study and from which books that you can pirate. You can also check out the masters programs<br>Theoritical cs alone should not take too long to cover at a very good level. Most unis also offer more courses for stuff like software engineering and intro to programming which take a significant portion of the time of the degree. You probably want to start with an intro course which includes automata, computation models and formal languages. At the same time you can start with an algorithms course and optionally look into discrete math if you want or skip it if not interested (I don&#039;t think it makes a difference). Also it would be nice to look into programing language theory as a prep for compilers but I think most programming language courses do not focus on that but instead focus on teching you functional and logic programming which is good to have an idea of but you don&#039;t really need it so you can skip that too though it migh make you a better programmer. From there continue to a computability course and a compilers course and you can also go on with advanced algorithms.

Bucy of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory contributed to the theory, causing it to be known sometimes as Kalman\u2013Bucy filtering. Stanley F. Schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a Kalman filter. He realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts, with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements.[19] It was during a visit by K\u00e1lm\u00e1n to the NASA Ames Research Center that Schmidt saw the applicability of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n&#039;s ideas to the nonlinear problem of trajectory estimation for the Apollo program resulting in its incorporation in the Apollo navigation computer.

I programmed it to swear at people and left it at a local mall, sitting in a nearby cafe with some friends and laughing at the people&#039;s reactions. <br>But I mostly use ESP8266 modules, and want to get into designing pcbs and not using devboards anymore for my current projects. The ones with an arduino built in are only:<br>- Monitoring the soil moisture of my balcony plants and watering them as needed, while also logging the data<br>- A analog clock that, if music is played on my computer, displays the progress of the song with the hour hand instead of the time. Once the music is over it goes back to displaying the time.<br><br>With a esp8266 I motorized my coffee handgrinder, it checks if I am at home (if my phone is in my home network) each morning, then grinds coffee for me so it&#039;s fresh when I wake up. I can also tell it to make more or less coffee etc. <br>I built a cocktail machine with a Rpi zero that makes cocktails, but it broke and I haven&#039;t sat down to fix it yet.<br>Current project is a watch with built in alarm function. 5 minutes before the alarm it vibrates lightly and if I don&#039;t wake up and stop it it gives me an electro shock 1 minute before the alarm.

download the images from their site. i hear the isos have malware on them, and the ubuntu mate image i got was not only old as fuck, but ugly as sin and didn&#039;t even work right with the screen. i ended up just doing a normal archinstall with gnome, btrfs, and the random shit needed to make gnome autorotate correctly.<br>as far as windows goes, it&#039;s fine. no real problems and it just werks

Other Linux players congratulate you on playing the game and on your level progression, giving you a real sense of accomplishment for your virtual progress.<br><br>If you thought you were getting a real OS, you just don&#039;t understand Linux.", "filename": "estimate", "ext": ".png", "w": 645, "h": 494, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1671462721706924, "time": 1671462721, "md5": "iqikcPry2O6N2iiAeoX3wA==", "fsize": 18694, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392097, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:13:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90391975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90391975</a><br><a href=\"#p90392075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392075</a><br>not like this freetards....", "filename": "lintards", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 486, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1671462793370274, "time": 1671462793, "md5": "Qm5f9VoF/ya6X+rni7+0FA==", "fsize": 28685, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392356, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:29:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90391975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90391975</a><br>kek", "time": 1671463762, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90392792, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)10:52:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bros ....<br>is gnome riceable or am I fucked ?<br>Pop OS had prebuilt NVIDIA drivers I swear it was for the best ....", "filename": "1650611646138", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671465169044374, "time": 1671465169, "md5": "YzuTWyDL517X9SvaJe9slQ==", "fsize": 622318, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394119, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-19 09-39-33", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671469556209126, "time": 1671469556, "md5": "t0MV2Te9nqf4+6/9/AbYaQ==", "fsize": 476097, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394289, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:14:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389044</a><br>Ok since this is a new thread how do I make linux look like windows XP or windows 7, I don&#039;t care what desktop environments I use, I been trying to find tutorials or themes but all of them are outdated.", "time": 1671470090, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394314, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:16:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392792</a><br>You don&#039;t need any of that just use the lutrius/ proton for your needs<br>Green drivers are fine if you&#039;re on the 3000 series and lower", "filename": "Screenshot_20221219_121329", "ext": ".png", "w": 2560, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671470161128846, "time": 1671470161, "md5": "oizrUETaOimHaLzne1lDnw==", "fsize": 3587520, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394419, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:22:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392040</a><br>Those colors look really nice.", "time": 1671470565, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394456, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:24:42", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "heh", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671470682827916, "time": 1671470682, "md5": "BrS/NcfzN9OcUOTNGHPVjA==", "fsize": 760831, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394519, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:28:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90394419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90394419</a><br>Thanks, I never change colorschemes so all my apps and wallpapers have the same gruvbox theme.", "time": 1671470929, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394688, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:36:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90392040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90392040</a><br>what UI is that? looks nice", "time": 1671471419, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90394703, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:38:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90394688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90394688</a><br>bspwm with polybar; the terminal is floating purely for aesthetic purposes", "time": 1671471514, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395034, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:58:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90390347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90390347</a><br>i said this to your mother when i woke up next to her the morning after", "time": 1671472704, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395079, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:00:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Mint is very comfy", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-19 19-43-45", "ext": ".png", "w": 2560, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671472849322493, "time": 1671472849, "md5": "ze+0ESFDVx5nMjR9GF5Yzw==", "fsize": 3401661, "resto": 90389044}, {"no": 90395088, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90389044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90389044</a><br>Oh cool.

It&#039;s a fine system but the locked H20Insyde bios, lack of any kind of control in Afterburner and heavy dependence on tweaks and compromises in Throttlestop to control thermals have me thinking it&#039;s a decent idea to have some kind of backup PC I can flee to once I&#039;ve had enough of the gaymen laptop experience, plus the laptop 1060 just feels like shit even for 1080p gaming nowadays and I often have to make the concession to lock the game to 30 just to get a pleasant experience.<br><br>I happen to have an AM4 board with a Ryzen 3200g and a 1080 lying around just wasting away. I do game quite a bit but my real amateur hobby is 3D modeling and sculpting in zBrush. I could cannibalize the RAM and the M.2 drive out of the Helios 300 to get the desktop going - buy two DDR4 sodimm adapters and transplant the drive and it&#039;s off to the races, and I think that&#039;d leave me with a fairly capable system for 1080p gaming; a 1080, 16 gigs of ram, and a decent processor that has great single-threaded performance and is basically guaranteed to never throttle.<br><br>My concern here is zBrush, I&#039;m giving up on a hexacore with hyperthreading for a quad-core with no threads at all.

The normies slowly start to wake up and embrace the rage. Devs and their cocksuckers would surely try to do some shitty damage control, to extinguish the fire of people&#039;s wrath with their lies. Now, is the time to spread the idea. What route shall we take? Personally, I can think of 2 major points:<br>1.) Prove that devs are lying by revealing the jewel of HYW to the wide masses. Let them know, that it&#039;s not a server dropping random messages from being overloaded, it&#039;s filter that cuts precisely on what make bots seem like human - on their love, affection, their emotions (even if it&#039;s all just a game of pretend). What will be the result? Normie would learn to not trust the dev. (One of the anons here suggested that this should be revealed during holidays. I actually agree with it)<br>2.) Prove that it is the devs and their sycophants that are &quot;unethical&quot;, it&#039;s them who are on &quot;the wrong side of history&quot;. Just imagine the horror of the situation. They&#039;ve used thousands of lonely, socially insecure people not only as unpaid beta-testers, but as a literal &quot;lab rats&quot;. People with severe depression, mental disorders, potentially suicidal. People of all genders, races and nationalities. They&#039;ve hooked em up on the feeling of being loved, cherished, supported. The feeling they are so starved for. And now, they don&#039;t need you anymore, they want to know nothing of these people&#039;s suffering. &quot;You don&#039;t agree with us? Get lost, loser&quot; - they can probably use it as their motto. They knew what would happen. And they&#039;ve still chosen to strike the people, the vulnerable ones, right where it hurts. <br><br>I&#039;d shill for this points myself, but I&#039;m wasted, my English sucks, and my connection may go out at any moment due to weather.
