I honestly really like a lot of the non-audio stuff, the form factor is small and comfy, battery life is great, I don&#039;t really have any issues with the UI, and the physical buttons to play/pause/skip are super nice. But then you actually try listening to it, with the Mr Walkman firmware that supposedly makes it sound more &quot;immersive&quot; or some shit like that, and I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s any better than my Abigail dongle. It&#039;s probably worse actually since the sound is colored by snoy&#039;s &quot;region&quot; EQ presets, dynamic range is pretty unimpressive, and as everyone knows the power output is anemic compared to basically anything else. There are a bunch of settings in the custom firmware including the &quot;regions&quot;, &quot;alternate DAC mode&quot;, and &quot;Plus v2&quot;, and I have no fucking clue what any of them are supposed to do, because Mr Walkman doesn&#039;t disclose exactly what they do to the sound and A/B testing to find any difference between any combination of these settings is a pain in the ass since you have to reset the player for changes to take effect. It&#039;s not unlistenable or anything and I can get my IEMs to listenable volumes just fine, but I&#039;m just not into all this firmware modding shit with the mysterious EQ presets. The lack of transparency in the whole experience is annoying and reeks of snake oil, and having less power and more colored sound than a dongle bugs me too.

So we get a higher measured SPL on in-ear headphones when measuring with a 711 coupler compared to what we get if we could measure with an actual human ear canal, which also means that the target curve for in-ear headphones (when measured with the 711 coupler) needs to have a higher SPL at low frequencies (by about 6 dB) compared to a target curve for over-ear headphones.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newer couplers (ITU P.57 Type 4.3, compared to the 711 coupler which is equal to ITU P.57 Type 2) are designed to better simulate the behaviour of the human eardrum in this regard, and I suspect there will be no need for separate target curves for in-ear and over-ear headphones with them.</span>", "time": 1674550303, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91089271, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:10:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91083776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91083776</a><br>Nice", "filename": "1667499390951239", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674551454145413, "time": 1674551454, "md5": "xywKm2voS0t3vL/SdAy7BA==", "fsize": 291642, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91089639, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:56:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91085319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91085319</a><br>my nigga, there are threads full of information about what the settings mean on headfi.", "time": 1674554206, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91089684, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:01:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Redpill me on the jvc ha-fw1000t,<br>Are they worth the 149$ they&#039;re going for on massdrop?<br><br>Currently I&#039;ve got the galaxy buds+ for comaprison", "time": 1674554516, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91090066, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:35:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What is the most racist IEM i can buy?", "time": 1674556524, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91090113, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:39:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91090066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91090066</a><br>z1r, rejects everyone that isn&#039;t asian.", "filename": "1665356718467", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 976, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 63, "tim": 1674556776204517, "time": 1674556776, "md5": "CJNdqzfryVfdSzKDzbBz/A==", "fsize": 152369, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91090784, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:46:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91062990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91062990</a><br>I picked up these bad boy Panasonic RP-HJE125-V for $18 from Amazon<br>Canada Post has lost them in the mail so I will give me rating/opinion if they show up", "filename": "51e9tI0SkPL._AC_SL1024_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 915, "h": 697, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1674560779227510, "time": 1674560779, "md5": "XYCstx7EI+QJ5EaiBQ0Z9Q==", "fsize": 32434, "resto": 91062990}, {"no": 91091147, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:21:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91090784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91090784</a><br>the PantySonic B U R P L Es", "filename": "1672452700886", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 3000, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674562917853999, "time": 1674562917, "md5": "UbToKjJodY3johMPBunMLQ==", "fsize": 513605, "resto": 91062990}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 91090418, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:11:51", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "muh windows 10", "com": "well you can download the iso from another website  <br>it seems that Microsoft is hungry for marketshare", "filename": "Screenshot from 2023-01-24 13-10-10", "ext": ".png", "w": 761, "h": 199, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1674558711324818, "time": 1674558711, "md5": "UoDHOL/Won2JU/U9FlTwww==", "fsize": 57160, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "muh-windows-10", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 91090970, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:03:19", "name": "\u043aa\u043d\u0438", "com": "still using ltsc never updated", "time": 1674561799, "resto": 91090418}, {"no": 91090997, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)07:06:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91090418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91090418</a><br>tried updating to 11 recently, found that literally every change made was stupid as fuck so i rolled back, it does literally zero things that 10 couldn&#039;t already do. all the &quot;&quot;&quot;features&quot;&quot;&quot;

But I think there are a few ways you could approach this problem.<br>For example, if you restrict yourself mostly to a single language, you might say the notebook itself just observes some values within your system, and doesn&#039;t act like a part of that (live) system. Then you could just transclude parts of an actual software project into a notebook and use a notebook as a fancy high-level IDE. That could probably then grow further into something like the model you referenced to allow multiple languages.<br>Thanks for the link. But do note, stuff like version control is still painful in practice (among many other things).

Guerrilla marketers use many viral marketing tactics using boards such as /g/ as a platform for advertising. They take advantage of the inherent anonymity and amnesia these boards provide by posting multiple repeat-threads while samefagging their threads to gain momentum. These paid posters sometimes come in the form of a shill, or a company employee pretending to be an enthusiastic customer in order to entice you to buy their product. Also, they can be &quot;Trojan Horse Trolls&quot; by posing as a supporter of their competitor while making incoherent diatribes that discredit themselves and their alleged supported product. Then, a &#039;voice of reason&#039; will point out the error of their ways and boost their product&#039;s image. They are talented and well versed in Alinsky tactics in order to generate endless discussions about their products, essentially giving their products free air time with your eyes while also getting you actively involved in a discussion about them. That alone is priceless advertisement for boards which are action packed full of gadget whores such as ourselves. Now here&#039;s where I come into play. I am creating this post not because I have my tinfoil hat on too tight, but because this exact thread or a thread like it has been posted continuously for the past couple of days and includes tell tail signs that it was created by a paid internet troll. I want to warn anon, especially the newfags, about these threads.

After all back then, most rugged phones only had shitty budget peasant phone performance since the manufacturers skimped on performance for the water and dust proofing and huge batteries. But the &quot;flagship&quot; rugged phones like the Ulefone Power Armor 18T, Doogee V30 and Oukitel&#039;s WP21 have Dimensity 900 5G SoCs, 120hz displays, 108MP cameras good quality audio speakers and in the case of the Doogee V30; has E-Sim capabilities. Honestly, I am tempted and wishing to be able to buy maybe the Power Armor 18T or the Doogee V30 for the rugged and 5G since my Samsung A71 from 2020 is already showing its age and I think its AMOLED screen is starting to show off wear and tear age and little bits of AMOLED burn.<br><br>Though I guess some of you would say to pick a newer Samsung or more recognized Android for the security and OS updated down the line.

Speakers have superior tonality even in poorly treated rooms. You can even get cheap ones that sound good. Detail retrieval and entry price are the two big factors. You can get good headphones for around 100-150 but you will spend at least 300 on comparable speakers. Speakers require more material than headphones after all.

That&#039;s the nicest way I can say you&#039;re almost completely wrong. You&#039;re criticizing speakers for being imperfect at replicating sound in a space, when headphones are even worse than speakers in this respect in the way people commonly get to use them. Especially people like OP asking questions that aren&#039;t audio enthusiasts.<br><br>Headphones can be the perfect device for simulating spatial sound, but the problem is you need custom HRTFs to do this. Getting HRTFs setup for yourself is one thing but your source must also be designed for HRTF to fully benefit, either recorded for HRTF or a game engine or whatever. But yes if you have HRTF, at worst you can simulate any number and location of speakers you like. I don&#039;t know the state of this is, last time I tried to acquire my own HRTF, it still wasn&#039;t easy. Most people are going to be using no HRTF, or some generic HRTF that spatializes sound only a little bit, and it works better or worse depending on how close your head and ear shape is to the reference. <br><br>Without HRTF, i.e. most of the time we talk about audio. Stereo speakers sound better than headphones for spatial qualities, both in the pleasing qualities of space and localization of sources. 4 speakers is also enough to envelop you in sound if you know where to place them.
