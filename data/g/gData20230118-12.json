The algorithms themselves cant be bigoted. These woke models either heavily redact real world data, possibly use fake, yet ideal data, or they program hard conditions into the algorithm to prevent it from giving results they dont want.</span><br><br><br>The flaw in your thinking is assuming &quot;real world data&quot; is a single source of objective truth.<br><br>In reality &quot;real word data&quot; is immense, diverse and often inaccurate. Phrenology studies are &quot;real world data,&quot; how do we weight their inclusion in any science related AI models? Young Earth Creationists in the USA do not ask for their &quot;evidence&quot; to be included in school curriculums, they ask for equal representation in school curriculums. Should we respect the wishes of the few remaining phrenologists and weight their text more heavily? The answer is probably &quot;no.&quot; Well is there ever a reason to reduce the weight of something in a model? Our funding/license for our scientific AI model does not allow us to use any text that is in copyright or might make us vulnerable to litigation and consequently we have a huge amount of outdated texts, tech journalist blogs, tech news comment sections and twitter posts to train our model. During the training we notice the inclusion of some of these sources is causing our model to be pulled away from being useful resource and towards pointless bickering. Consequently we remove the tech blogs and tech news comment sections from the training set. We renegotiate our funding and gain access to the entirety of JSTOR.

society. especially in countries like the US where the other half that makes up rightoids are armed to the teeth (and the left here doesn&#039;t have complete control of their own tribes yet as well, see the black community freaking out every two - three years, and the asian community that&#039;s suing their own tribe members in courts over discrimination against them in schools).<br><br>its why they are trying to hard to disarm america. even if only 5-10% of the right are willing to use guns, thats still millions and guerilla warefare is brutal and pretty much results in scorched earth. the elites want to rule, and if there isn&#039;t any civilization left to rule over, they have no purpose. as much as biden continues to want to threaten bombing his &quot;fellow americans&quot; with f15&#039;s and blowing them up with tanks, when you have to use those things, nothing is leftover. look at ukraine. doesn&#039;t matter who wins, ukraine has been turned into a wasteland. and see the entire middle east for twenty years where guerilla warefare was hell for the US and they still lost in afghan. barely won in iraq.<br><br>so its better to do a containment strategy and do it slowly. especially if you can get your opposition to contain themselves. push them out of &quot;mainstream&quot; society. leave the &quot;normies&quot; to be brainwashed by leftist, and keep the wrong thinkers out, isolated to their own communities. make them become laughing stalks and have normies completely reject them. instill both humiliation and fear of them within mainstream society. once you choke off your opposition enough, and get mainstream society to collectively reject and no longer care what happens to them, you can now finally reign violence down upon them. or, you may not have to even fire a single shot if the isolated tribe slowly whither away and dies out.<br><br>this was successfully done with the kkk.", "time": 1673978841, "resto": 90946023}, {"no": 90949541, "now":

When the network is restored you have 2 instances of your stuff, each with conflicting IP addresses since they are both up. A clusterfuck.<br>With 3 nodes a quorum is established - a majority of 2 nodes have to agree to take action. In the situation above when your main node goes down then the backup node, and the third node agree to take action of bringing your stuff up. When the main node comes online it will see that it doesn&#039;t have quorum so it won&#039;t take any action, because it knows there&#039;s nodes missing.

I guess the demand caught up to the shrinking supply because now even low-end Trinitrons are getting expensive when people used to pay you to take them away.<br>These days I&#039;d be happy with a 13&quot; CRT that has composite and stereo to play PS1 games on occasionally.", "time": 1674004334, "resto": 90956392}, {"no": 90956687, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)20:14:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90956392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90956392</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;any modern gaming monitor</span><br>No, not OLED", "time": 1674004490, "resto": 90956392}, {"no": 90956725, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)20:17:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90956687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90956687</a><br>.", "filename": "1674004627931", "ext": ".png", "w": 1652, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 48, "tim": 1674004655679978, "time": 1674004655, "md5": "bVtC25E9+qVlMrlfagFB+A==", "fsize": 1083481, "resto": 90956392}, {"no": 90956746, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)20:18:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90956392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90956392</a><br>You could have the best CRT in the world and you would still get clapped in games so what does it matter?", "time": 1674004725, "resto": 90956392}, {"no": 90956754, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)20:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90956500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90956500</a><br>based", "time": 1674004747, "resto": 90956392}, {"no": 90956917, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)20:29:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90956392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90956392</a><br>Everytime you make this thread the price of crt raises by 50%.

MATE is a lightweight, old school desktop environment. KDE is more modern and is probably the most featureful/customizable desktop in existence (it&#039;s also a very lightweight desktop these days in terms of resource usage).<br><br>Personally, I&#039;m a big fan of KDE. For all the years I spent DE/WM hopping, I always came back to KDE, and now I&#039;ve settled on it for good. It&#039;s got so many amazing features, like KDE Connect, Krunner, and so on (in fact, KDE&#039;s so fucking loaded with neat features that a lot of them are easy to miss). KDE generally has really robust support for features that take other DEs years to implement, like fractional scaling, turning off mouse acceleration (other DEs have this now, but it took them fucking years to implement) or the infamous filepicker meme. <br><br>You can turn it into whatever the fuck you want--a MacOS clone with a global menu, a GNOME clone with an overview menu, a tiling window manager, and so on. And a lot of its default apps (like Dolphin, Konsole, and so on) are best in class--Dolphin is the most powerful file manager I&#039;ve ever used. Basically, if there&#039;s a feature you want, chances are it exists in KDE. If there&#039;s an option you want to change, you almost certainly can in KDE. The downside is that KDE has so much shit going on that the UI can feel cluttered, and it can feel buggy/rough around the edges in some areas. This is increasingly becoming a non-issue, though, especially now that Valve is funding KDE.<br><br>MATE is great if all you&#039;re after is a basic desktop, though.

Firefox has been confirmed to now send analytics to Google. According to a Firefox developer the spyware in Firefox is &quot;extremely useful to us and we have already weighed the cost/benefit of using tracking.&quot; and that Firefox will not remove Google Analytics support entirely. Firefox&#039;s position on privacy is made very clear with this quote:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Wanted to address your position though: We don&#039;t give the &quot;data directly to Google&quot;. See the discussion here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_b<wbr>ug.cgi?id=858839. The short version is: tl;dr: We now have an option to opt-out of Google doing anything with the data that Google Analytics collections on Mozilla websites. GA tracking is anonymous and at the aggregate level and we use it to improve the experience of our websites. We are collecting aggregate and non-identifiable data in numbers to ensure our development/UX changes are met well. We can respect privacy and still have analytics; in fact Mozilla&#039;s aim is for an experience that values user privacy and usability (I&#039;d say Apple also wants UX that fits that mold, as an example). We need some data, anonymized and aggregated, to do this.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best takeaway to this is that Mozilla wants to pretend that including spyware in their program is somehow not a breach of privacy, and that Firefox could possibly be respecting user privacy while simultaneously collecting data on users and sending it to Google. It&#039;s strongly suggested reading the GitHub thread and the further anti-privacy statements the Mozilla employee makes while defending the spyware features in Firefox. It&#039;s very dangerous to assert that there is somehow a middle ground between respecting user privacy and datamining the user.</span>", "time": 1673987399, "resto": 90951107}, {"no": 90952097, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90952027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90952027</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brave is the browser that is taking a stance against Jewgle</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he said about chromium reskin #325</span>", "time": 1673987574, "resto": 90951107}, {"no": 90952103, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:33:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Firefox trannies on full cope mode today.

Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome\u2019s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.<br><br>Mozilla will maintain support for blocking WebRequest in MV3. To maximize compatibility with other browsers, we will also ship support for declarativeNetRequest. We will continue to work with content blockers and other key consumers of this API to identify current and future alternatives where appropriate. Content blocking is one of the most important use cases for extensions, and we are committed to ensuring that Firefox users have access to the best privacy tools available.<br><br>Firefox MV3 stands apart from other iterations of MV3 in two critical ways:<br><br>    While other browser vendors introduced declarativeNetRequest (DNR) in favor of blocking Web Request in MV3, Firefox MV3 continues to support blocking Web Request and will support a compatible version of DNR in the future.

Every single use I&#039;ve heard of has you encrypt a symmetric key (hopefully single-use...) with your correspondent&#039;s public key, and then encrypting your actual message (or file, etc) with that symmetric key. You concatenate the results and send them. So your correspondent can decrypt the symmetric key with his private key but there&#039;s zero forward secrecy. Someone who compromises his keypair can read all his messages, should they have captured them somehow.

Dynamic drivers are fine, arguably better than planar magnetic and electrostatic in the sense that they&#039;re generally cheap, reliable, lightweight, easy to drive, and can still have a frequency range that extends past human hearing.

More into the weeds but there there is also the question of if you should even want a neutral sound because a lot of music is flat and lacking detail. An aggressive V-shape done right in my view is unrated and very good for movies and games since the stimulus isn&#039;t as constant and listener fatigue is less of a factor. <br><br>Not sure if any of this answers your question but there&#039;s no hard-and-fast rule that equates to buy X headphones if you like classical and opera music.", "time": 1673865892, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926300, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:09:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "THREADLY REMINDER<br>flat /= neutral", "time": 1673870949, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926381, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90926300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90926300</a><br>Flat is injustice", "filename": "maxresdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673871454348430, "time": 1673871454, "md5": "I1+71n+lVU0sU5N1rpw50g==", "fsize": 164671, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926398, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:18:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90926300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90926300</a><br>Flat = gross<br>Neutral = good?", "time": 1673871538, "resto": 90916242}, {"no": 90926578, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)07:34:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90916242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90916242</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Location</span><br>EUfag<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Budget</span><br>max 30\u20ac<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intended Use</span><br>Music, videos and also to wear just as noise mufflers during the day, without music even.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sources</span><br>PC and Phone<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kind</span><br>Just not in-ear.

If you turn your head while listening to speakers, it&#039;s still localized at distance. Turn completely around, yep, still there. Turn upside down, still out of your head. <br><br>There is no consistent way to get out-of-head localization with headphones unless you recorded sound with a dummy ears that almost perfectly matched your ears then played it back or perhaps mapped your HRTF and used some type of algorithm to process sound but accurate mapping is very difficult because just sticking a small microphone in your ear changes the HRTF. It&#039;s common for people to claim that open-backs have a better soundstage but that&#039;s most likely because the poor noise isolation creates a feeling of openness and external sounds from the environment aid placebo effect. Driver distance and pad size may also contribute to that effect while not actually changing the sound beyond the frequency response, which would explain why the HD 800s is popular despite how poorly it measures. <br><br>This post isn&#039;t really directed at you specifically, I&#039;m just a bit irked at how popular this buzzword is and how it has been misused for marketing purposes probably since Sennheiser invented the open-back in 1968.

Obviously you&#039;re sol if you want to use the normal stack(though it MAY be possible to do some wizardry, I&#039;m not hopeful for a magical open source html rendering engine anytime soon), so instead you use something else, probably sexps, maybe byte compile and compressed. Now you&#039;ve basically reinvented HTML+CSS+JS. Did you do a better job? Maybe. And then you&#039;ve got to network all this, and it&#039;s obviously going to have to be p2p since lets face it, it&#039;ll never be popular enough for a server ecosystem to make sense.

So you can run autocad in wasm on your machine, then pause the system, zip the vm state, send it to another computer, and continue from where you left off.<br>Or, if you implement an entire os in wasm, you could hibernate your entire system into a file, and using those augmented hyperlinks I mentioned before, remotely back it up, open and run it, dissassemble and step through it, etc...<br>The reason you want to actually use wasm instead of just compiling to it or compiling to x86 is in order to use these high level features your program has to KNOW it&#039;s running in wasm and how wasm modules/memories work and how to run them.", "time": 1673783786, "resto": 90903081}, {"no": 90908167, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)07:14:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90907979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90907979</a><br>Really that&#039;s just showing the superiority of interpreters and the tyranny of compiled assembly.

You use these tools and uncomment text in a config file to make doom do what you want. The moment you want to add some elisp you found somewhere to make your emacs work a certain way, doom will start fighting you. <br>A starter pack like prelude is a better choice. It&#039;s just regular elisp the way you would write it as a normal user. It&#039;s a bit much to look at at first because unlike doom where you just modify the one config file, prelude&#039;s config is broken into multiple files. Prelude is also a nice choice if you want to roll your own config. The way it&#039;s broken into multiple files in lisp/ directory that are (require)&#039;d in init.el is likely the same strategy you&#039;d eventually land on if you roll your own config.<br>Prelude (or any other small starter pack) + a pdf of mastering emacs will be the most effective onboarding and it&#039;s not gonna leave you with wasted project-specific knowledge specific like doom / spacemacs.<br>Finally I&#039;d like to add that in general the more you get to know emacs the less you will actually want in your init.

This is the reason why we want a macro to return a quoted form, and not the actual result like functions do. So:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(print &quot;Hello World&quot;)<br>(my-macro function argument)<br>(+ 1 1)<br></pre><br>Would simply become:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(print &quot;Hello World&quot;)<br>(function argument)<br>(+ 1 1)<br></pre><br><br>And finally comes the second stage, where the expanded result of your macro is once again evaluated, but this time together with all the rest of your program, as if it had been there all along.", "time": 1674002944, "resto": 90903081}, {"no": 90956273, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90928867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90928867</a><br>The only reason to change is upgrade anxiety.

In last post he claimed that println! being a macro makes it more limiting than printf that is a function. Which is complete negation of the reality. println! is more flexible precisely because it is a macro, you can extend it and write your own formatters for your own custom types and it will just work with every macro that uses argument formatting. On the other hand printf can only format fixed number of built in types and that&#039;s pretty much it.
