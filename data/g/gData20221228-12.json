That provides something very similar to redundancy of RAID.<br>There are downsides - you don&#039;t get any performance increase (in general) compared to using just one drive, and the parity needs to be updated on schedule, it&#039;s not realtime.

Hoare in an introduction to the classic paper, An Axiomatic Definition of the Programming Language Pascal , for the book, Great Papers in Computer Science. In reference to his goal of designing a better programming language - one which makes it easier to write correct programs and harder to write incorrect ones - Hoare writes, \u201cIt is a matter of continuing regret that so few languages have ever been designed to meet that goal, or even to make significant concessions towards it. For example, the programming language C was designed to assist in writing a small single-user operating system (UNIX) for a real-time minicomputer (PDP 11), now thankfully obsolete. For this purpose, its low level of abstraction and plethora of machine-oriented features are entirely appropriate. For all other purposes, they are a nuisance. The successful propagation of the language can be explained by accidental, commercial, historical, and political factors; it is hardly due to any inherent quality as a tool for the reliable creation of sophisticated programs.\u201d", "time": 1672229345, "resto": 90562331}, {"no": 90562733, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)07:11:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90562331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90562331</a><br>Based dad anon.", "time": 1672229487, "resto": 90562331}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 90560102, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:24:29", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "girl talk", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;talking to (fertile) girl at work</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;impress her with warez knowledge</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sure i can pirate whatever you want (hoping she will ask me for harry potter &amp; we can watch it together, this is my plan)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;instead asks if i can get posts from locked substack </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;yea,&quot; i chuckle, &quot;obviously&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;google qickly how to pirate substacks </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whoops haha i thought you meant something else, thats actually not crackable since they use CD-ROM DRM</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she says her &quot;friend&quot; can do it though and &quot;jokes&quot; that im a fake hacker</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cuckold.kpg</span><br>if i accuse her friend of faking do i win? she is 8/10 (but tall) and im scared she will humiliate me with gossiping hags<br>i cant allow another loss", "filename": "117", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4500, "h": 6430, "tn_w": 174, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672212269438968, "time": 1672212269, "md5": "YhrZaYgmIxPdVcBhez4r5Q==", "fsize": 2321700, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "girl-talk", "replies": 9, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 90560196, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:33:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "this is why i prefer to shut up and never doxx anyone what i can and can not do. more peaceful that way, less expectations and headache. and if someone needs my help my response is always &quot;i don&#039;t know, talk to specialist&quot;", "time": 1672212796, "resto": 90560102}, {"no": 90560207, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:34:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;talking to girl</span><br>faggot shit", "time": 1672212886, "resto": 90560102}, {"no": 90560245, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:38:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90560102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90560102</a><br>She doesn&#039;t care about the substack posts, she was just making conversation.", "time": 1672213092, "resto": 90560102}, {"no": 90560294, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:42:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90560196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90560196</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doxx</span><br>this word is misused so much it means nothing anymore", "time": 1672213366, "resto": 90560102}, {"no": 90560426, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)02:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90560102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90560102</a><br>Cute mouse OP.<br>But unfortunately you are a lala fruity homoman that talks to girls.

Better build quality be switching to metal frame. Backlit for keyboard, and keyboard reduced to thumb typing instead of being too big for thumbs and too small for fingers like the other one. Looks like they still have that bad D-pad design. The marketing idea of a &quot;fantasy console&quot; seems a bit silly to me. Like a powered up gameboy you can code games on, I&#039;ve seen several devices with similar ideas following the rapid play-testing development idea. I get that it would allow people to code and play in unique ways, which would be good for learning. And the hardware is more powerful than the competition, but seems a bit too far given some of the hardware options could also lead to developing for uncommon setups. They do have some common versions like the one with the Raspberry Pi in it, but someone less knowledge could get the specs and architectures mixed around and end up with a version that wouldn&#039;t be what they wanted. I guess they assume if you buy one you are smart enough not to need all that hand holding and will get the right version for what you are doing. <br><br>Personally I like it, but not for the reason they made it.<br>I&#039;ve been getting frustrated about many of my tasks falling in between computer and smartphone areas, and getting hammered by updates and upgrades.

Firstly the volume of rarepads sold isn&#039;t really enough to create a decent price database and you can&#039;t use prices that are old since the market changes. This is aggravated by the fact that quite a few of those that are sold go through private sales or trades since many are in the hands of collectors who tend to not do public auctions.<br>And that&#039;s not getting into the fact that certain models are more common on foreign markets such as yahoo auctions (240, pc110 etc.) or the Singapore market (S30/31 with Eng keyboard) and the price there would be different from eBay.<br>Secondly the price guide is created with the general public in mind whereas with rarepad since your getting into what is pretty much a collectors market more details matter. A sticker might not change the price much on a X230 but would matter for your models. I&#039;ve seen someone pay a premium because a model had the original IBM background on the desktop screen.<br>Thirdly i don&#039;t really see who&#039;d benefit from such a guide.

I&#039;m not really sure why they care so much about making sure you have an ATNT / Tmobile GoyLine but I&#039;m not interested in participating and still need to open up business accounts for my company. I&#039;m wanting a modern service I can pay with crypto and don&#039;t need to wait for a physical card to arrive in the mail like its 2005.

It is his responsibility to ensure his customers receive the quality that he has written into the product description and conveyed through images. How else is a customer supposed to decide if he wants a product? You can&#039;t fly quickly over to China and take a look at them in person now can you? If he sends out subpar quality products contrary to the product listing, then he has to give you a replacement without these defects or give you a discount for subpar quality products.

The short version is: Cheap servos work really well, unless you need torque. They have plastic gearing inside and will not provide as much force as some applications need. They are also have some quirks, some are the usual servo ones (limited range of mobility, usually 180\u00b0, not relevant for your usecase), but cheaper ones may have a minimum angle of movement (think of it like a deadzone on a controller) and some will move a little upon powerup. Also they have limited resolution, which should be expected. <br>You can always increase resolution in exchange for torque with gearing, but making gears so small is hard, and making them bigger means a bigger machine/robot. <br>The two positives: They are really cheap and you don&#039;t need a &quot;controller&quot;. The controller is part of the motor, meaning you give it a angle it should reach by providing a pulse of a specific length, so all you need is a chip that can provide a accurate pulse. Any arduino nano can do that, so the &quot;controller&quot; part will cost you 2-4$. Use a ESP8266 if you don&#039;t want to have to use serial connection with a wire. <br><br>Given how cheap those parts are, you can test a ultra cheap prototype (with just one hand of servos) for maybe 15$ or something, barely any risk. If you want to use higher quality motors, prices will be higher. <br><br><a href=\"#p90542278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90542278</a><br>They stopped doing that as much, at least for me.
