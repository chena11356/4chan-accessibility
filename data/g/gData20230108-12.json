Look for VESA DisplayHDR 1400 certification.<br><br>Prev: <a href=\"/g/thread/90770576#p90770576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90770576</a>", "filename": "311080.4ad873d27b64121e081ed9a4dab03552.1600", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673163326416110, "time": 1673163326, "md5": "CrWVV84O5r0hdGUpb216cg==", "fsize": 82760, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "pcbg-pc-building-general", "replies": 157, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 63, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 90774352, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:37:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "7950X3D is God King.", "time": 1673163435, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774358, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:37:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "resizable bar - good, or gay?", "time": 1673163453, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774369, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:38:53", "name": "Phoney", "com": "<a href=\"#p90774336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90774336</a><br>5800x3d investing in dead chipset with no upgradability a good idea for sheer perfrormance?", "time": 1673163533, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774374, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90774352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90774352</a><br>I wonder how much faster than the KS it will be", "time": 1673163558, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774383, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:40:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "tranny op pic, sage and hide", "time": 1673163617, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774389, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:40:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90774358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90774358</a><br>required for arc gpus to work<br>for amd you should have it enabled because its always a net gain<br>for nvidia it depends on the game because it can actually drop your fps its usually in older titles", "time": 1673163636, "resto": 90774336}, {"no": 90774404, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:42:42", "name": "Phone insert shitty meme here", "com": "<a href=\"/g/thread/90770576#p90774366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90774366</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desperate bitchless samefag shill trying to feel better about his overpriced garbage</span><br>Fuck off.

Facebook is mostly C++ and PHP/Hack. Their applications are written as microservices which sit behind api gateways. To access the feed microservice (for example), the call goes to the api gateway of your region (say western europe) which routes it to one of the many instances of the feed api (generaly the one with the better health checks, lower cpu and ram usage). That&#039;s how they handle things on the application layer at scale. On the database layer, for facebook for example, they have 1000 MySQL databases and 1000 Memcache caches. They rely heavily on caching to serve frequently requested data in with near 0 latency. Their MySQL implementation is distributed through sharding.

Aux Bluetooth receiver - haven&#039;t tested it yet, but it looks fine. Buttons feels suprisingly satisfying. MicroUSB cable is ultra short, which was to be expected. Pretty good for the price.<br>2. 100 chinese bandaids. Might give me band-aids. Time will tell.<br>3. A very nice little pouch. Comes well packaged with one main compartment and one outer compartment that stretches to fit larger items. Attaches to a belt or molle system. Comes with a carabiner and foam inside so it keeps its form in transport, pleasantly surprised by the quality. Buckle is cheap plastic though. I&#039;d have preferred it without the &quot;sport&quot; on it, but very happy for 2$.<br>4. Plush shark. I have since learned that plush sharks are a lbtq thing, but whatever. It&#039;s cute and it was 2$. Can&#039;t complain.<br>5. Wine stoppers, 2 pcs. Got them as gifts, they should do the job. Enough to keep flies out at least.<br>6. Folding rubber band gun with rubber bands. The front attachment hook for the rubber bands isn&#039;t big enough, so you can&#039;t load more than 4 bands at once into the revolver, but other than that it&#039;s nice. Might get a second as a gift so I can shoot a friend whenever we meet each other.<br>7. Chinese lego set. Not sure yet if it&#039;ll be a gift or if I will build it myself. If I do, I will report back.<br>8. Metal hooks. They do what they say, no complaints here. <br>9. 2m LED strip with motion sensor. I hope the motion sensor works well, but I can&#039;t test it at the moment.<br>10. 5 of those &quot;eternal pencil leads&quot;. No idea how well they will work, I hope it&#039;s not a normal pencil lead or else it&#039;ll be real annoying to sharpen once it wears off.<br>11. A plant sprayer that attaches to PET bottles.

It&#039;s very small, but that was to be expected. The knife on it is short and dull as shit, but nothing that a few minutes on a sharpening stone couldn&#039;t fix.  It does have springs that make using the plier part more enjoyable. Since it&#039;s so small it could be a nice thing to carry with you when space and weight are at a premium. I do not have too high hopes for the carbon content of the steel, probably going to be very soft and dull quickly.<br>13. USB-C (M) to MicroUSB (F), USB-A (M) to USB-C(F) and USB-C(M) to USB-A(F) adapters. All advertised as &quot;USB 3.0&quot; and surprisingly the USB ports do have the appropriate amount of pins.

After 4 years of this you start as a copilot making about 100k, then keep doing training and tests while you build experience. You need to maintain thousands of hours of flight time every year to stay licensed. If you fail a test at any time you scrub out. After 5 YoE or so you can do the test to become a captain and start making bank, but if you fail you scrub out. No second chance, you are a copilot forever unless you quit and go to an LCC. Also if you fail a monthly health check you\u2019re grounded until you get better. That means a chronic ear infection can essentially end your career because you don\u2019t book enough flight time to stay current. The reason for this is that there\u2019s so many rules to flying that if you stop doing it for a few months you will fuck up, and if you fuck up people die.<br><br>tldr pilots are a lot more deserving of the title \u201cengineer\u201d than software devs are, and that\u2019s why good ones make more money than you (and the bad ones scrub out).", "time": 1673155643, "resto": 90757565}, {"no": 90772956, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)00:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "day 7", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-07 at 9.29.42 PM", "ext": ".png", "w": 612, "h": 668, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673155795337538, "time": 1673155795, "md5": "U6uVYzOXj+pdFvHI1FwTnQ==", "fsize": 57284, "resto": 90757565}, {"no": 90773203, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)00:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90772351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90772351</a><br>WGU isn\u2019t much of a brand name, GATech is.

No winner, both subpar packages.<br><br>Sound: Same DAC &amp; cable, straight from weeks of Olina SE listening to the Ouranos. Ouranos is harder-than-average to drive, nothing crazy.<br><br>Bass: Ouranos reaches deeper into sub bass. Plays with a heavier weight than Olina SE. Olina SE retains advantage of supernatural speed in the low-end, doesn&#039;t ever linger, plays and then decays.<br><br>Mids: Olina SE has the more correct mids, in line with expected neutral. Ouranos is more U-shaped. Pro is nice macro contrast between bass, mids, and treble, more exciting listen. Con is non-linear mids, slight recess.<br><br>Treble: Ouranos treble tuning is very good. Enhanced vocals, but still smooth, resistant to sibilance, ending with a natural rolloff. Olina SE presents as brighter, clearer, and with more extension. Olina SE excels at delivering on female vocals and treble detail being center-stage.

I&#039;ve tried two other GPUs, including a different 4080 FE and did not experience game crashes with either other card. So fucking annoying. Can&#039;t believe my luck as to get a fucked 4080 FE. At least Nvidia is pretty good about RMAing from what I understand. Maybe the tech I&#039;m working with will figure something else out but I&#039;m doubting it at this point.

I said, &quot;You&#039;re willing to use that trash OS yet you&#039;re trying to learn cybersecurity&quot;. Then I proceeded to act like a mix of Stallman, Distrotube, and Switched to Linux. Giving off big dick aura about using Arch on my &quot;gaming rig&quot;, Void on another machine, and Devuan on my laptop. Then having over 10 flash drives with various linux distros with all of my essential needs for any time. He clearly felt inferior and decided to strike at me at which I blocked him and swept him off his feet as if we were in a Mortal Kombat game. Then stomped his fucking face into the break room floor. Until he started bleeding. He let out a wimpering &quot;reeeeee&quot; and I then picked up a chair next the table to me and slung it at his chest. He fell over and then came rushing in our manager who picked me up like he was trying to fuck me in the ass. Wouldn&#039;t stop screaming in my fucking ear while his fat rolls rubbed up against my back and his stench started to burn my nosehairs out. I was dragged into the office where I was further yelled at by this fat lard of a manager as well as security. They took my name badge and uniform then security walked me out. Where I just sat and waited for my ride. Faggot boy didn&#039;t get fired and still works there to this very day slaving away and clearly failed at his cybersecurity quest. While I ended up finding a mommy gf who I ended up cumming inside of so much that she got pregnant and now I get tendies and milkies every single night while bitch boy wageslaves with no pussy.

It seems that &quot;jailbreak&quot; refers to a custom ROM with a root user and port of Debian APT to install .deb packages, the end result a phone very similar to typical UNIX, plus the sideload/jailbreak patch. Various .deb packages exist to install the LAMP stack directly for example that their scene focuses on, while Android is more about these awkward .zip file bundles which I believe are mounted using mergerfs over /system, and xposed modules applied on boot using complex exploits, as the phone aggressively resets itself if you change anything with the typical Magisk systemless root solution these days, LAMP typically installed in an emulated shell in appspace instead for convenience, installers of patches feeling more like DOS than UNIX. I believe it&#039;s only this complicated due to Google barring phones from running certain apps via Safetynet if /system is ever written to, and the Android scene overengineering everything rather than cracking it.
