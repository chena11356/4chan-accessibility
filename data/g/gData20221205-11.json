Reason is not known.<br><br>Realistically how would /g/ approach this?<br><br>Tor exits are not an option obviously.<br><br>Commercial VPNs apparently are verboten too? Never tried them, can someone elaborate?<br><br>And what about more exotic stuff like I2P ?<br><br>Could it be used as a proxy?<br><br>Addendum from the other thread:<br><br>Someone suggested using proxychains-ng and residential proxies.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A socks proxy is typically someone&#039;s residential cable internet box or home router that has been compromised by a bot and you connect through it giving you a residential and not blocked IP but these vary in cost from $5/mth to $200 depending how many you need and if they haven&#039;t already been used but I doubt any used to post here. They aren&#039;t persistent and die often so typically each connection you use a new one and many browser plugins of squidproxy exist to chain these or switch them randomly.</span>", "filename": "1920_180329-edward-snowden-banner-430401436", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 721, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670214779769064, "time": 1670214779, "md5": "tgWjs0pukMCK7RzKjE1fnQ==", "fsize": 158435, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ccg-censorship-circumvention-general-tor-i2p", "replies": 25, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 20, "omitted_images": 6, "last_replies": [{"no": 90126336, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:00:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90126279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90126279</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy a mootpass</span><br>I wont.", "time": 1670245256, "resto": 90121186}, {"no": 90126337, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:00:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90121186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90121186</a><br>/psg/ already covers this subject <a href=\"/g/thread/90108973#p90108973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90108973</a>", "time": 1670245259, "resto": 90121186}, {"no": 90126393, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90126337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90126337</a><br>partly yes.", "filename": "1670198395790446", "ext": ".png", "w": 704, "h": 1206, "tn_w": 72, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670245548383342, "time": 1670245548, "md5": "PKtJxtKxYPF7bptI/s1L8w==", "fsize": 112100, "resto": 90121186}, {"no": 90128109, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)10:53:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1670255591, "resto": 90121186}, {"no": 90128150, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)10:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p90121186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;90121186</a><br>Nobody here cares about this topic but m/aids/ and he&#039;s too mentally ill to make anything that appeals to anyone else.
