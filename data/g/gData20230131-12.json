quickly or automatically. i personally like a program like gridmove on windows with middle mouse resize and xper1 grid for the best combination of tiling and floating on that OS..<br>on linux it&#039;s a different story though, i like being able to use only the keyboard to do everything including moving windows, closing them, etc. when you&#039;ve stored all the keychords and shortcuts and commands to do things it&#039;s much faster i found in my experience.<br>i also like using my thinkpad in the framebuffer console with tmux and when i startx into a tiling wm like awesomewm the

Also version control, ie I see bad stuff in a torrent like a broken subtitles in nyaa anime, fix it and add it to my private tracker so the new version is avaliably for download, at least for myself. Maybe also share it with others in a future, but that&#039;s a long shot.<br>I also want to add some torrents that just make sense for me without much of a fuss, like Plex-friendly torrents or clean VM images, which are a bitch to find for some reason.<br>Second is to use torrent for backups. I create a backup, encrypt it and put it into my tracker via the script. Then I can download it anywhere torrent can reach and re-download it in case of faliure. I only need to be careful not to lose my private key or password. <br>I actually think that this use case can be scaled to more than myself. You have my backup, I have yours, everybody win.<br>Third is the most far-fetched one. I have a small booru and I want to add favorite torrent creation functionality. User requests his favourites snapshot, my site creates a folder with a bunch of hardlinks and creates a torrent and puts it into my tracker for user download.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1675156763, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244249, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:24:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91244197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244197</a><br>I also want an extremely simple piece of functionality to work: I have computer A and computer B in a same network. I create torrent on the computer A and send it to the computer B. Then I add ip of a computer A to the torrent and put it into the computer B. It should be obvious that download would start almost immediately, but it doesn&#039;t. I tried this stuff with transmission-daemon and qbittorent and I think with a bunch of others, but I didn&#039;t have enough time for research.<br>Now I decided to go back and get to the bottom of this problem. To my mind, torrent should be a natural fit for sending and recieving a large amount of data locally, but my experience so far is that it&#039;s unreasonably hard to do.<br>Or maybe I&#039;m just a dumb-dumb who doesn&#039;t see something obvious.<br><br>2/2", "time": 1675157064, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244318, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:30:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91244197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244197</a><br><a href=\"#p91244249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244249</a><br>Literally make a torrent, set the private flag and add any one of these trackers", "time": 1675157426, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244337, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91244318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244318</a><br>Forgot link: https://github.com/ngosang/trackers<wbr>list/blob/master/trackers_best.txt", "time": 1675157492, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244371, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:34:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91239073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91239073</a><br>412cuck gtfo", "filename": "O-O", "ext": ".gif", "w": 853, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675157660617536, "time": 1675157660, "md5": "hCPBDJUaFXecNyPOAYCVnw==", "fsize": 841613, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244421, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:39:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91244197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244197</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; version is avaliable to</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; for user to download</span><br><a href=\"#p91244249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244249</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;put it into the computer B&#039;s torrent client</span><br>fixed [spoiler]I&#039;m a sleep-deprived ESL and my grammar isn&#039;t perfect even on my best days.[/spoiler]<br><a href=\"#p91244318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244318</a><br><a href=\"#p91244337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244337</a><br>I think that I&#039;ve tried this too and it didn&#039;t work for some reason.<br>If I remember correctly, I&#039;ve made a backup of all AlfaBusa youtube videos and wanted to share them.<br>Added a bunch of public trackers, then logined to the external machine, added my torrent and the download didn&#039;t start.<br>Maybe something to do with the fact that my client is in a docker internal network with vpn, but I think it wasn&#039;t the case back then.<br>I&#039;m a bit hazy on the details, it&#039;s been a while.", "time": 1675157987, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244513, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:48:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91243668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91243668</a><br>i use proton anyway???<br>they dont have my ip<br>and they don&#039;t leak emails. proton is great.", "time": 1675158498, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244522, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:49:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91243902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91243902</a><br><a href=\"#p91244197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244197</a><br>UNIT3D looks like ASS<br>Gazelle is a hundred times better", "time": 1675158559, "resto": 91179089}, {"no": 91244528, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:50:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91244522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91244522</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gazelle is a hundred times better</span><br>Thanks.

You can snag a used 11/XR on swappa as they guarantee your phone still has 80% battery health. just read the description and look for one above 90.", "time": 1675111912, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91232673, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)15:58:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91228324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91228324</a><br>Oh thanks actually helped", "time": 1675112307, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91232718, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:00:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pixel 6a, Galaxy A52, galaxy a53, or nothing 1<br>And if there&#039;s any other better phone in this range lemme know", "time": 1675112409, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91232853, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:05:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91226941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91226941</a><br>Something must be wrong with your unit <br><br>I&#039;ve had the 20FE with SD and didn&#039;t have a single issue with it, it didn&#039;t lag and certainly didn&#039;t feel cheap, even with it&#039;s plastic back", "time": 1675112711, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91233145, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:18:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91223851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91223851</a><br>I want her to look at me like that.<br><br><a href=\"#p91224158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91224158</a><br><a href=\"#p91224067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91224067</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dick measuring</span><br>Funny because all the Applefags are busy measuring benchmark dicks on their new Apple M series chipsets on Macs.<br><br><a href=\"#p91224987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91224987</a><br>This desu<br><br><a href=\"#p91227219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91227219</a><br>Why not Aliexpress if you a poorfag?<br><br><a href=\"#p91228243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91228243</a><br>Don\u2019t fall for the wireless Jew. <a href=\"#p91228720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91228720</a><br>Average $100 TWS still sounds worse than my $40 chinkFi IEMs. And it\u2019s not just the price; the sound signature on  vast majority of TWS/wireless buds is tuned for hip hop/EDM fags. <br><br><a href=\"#p91230590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91230590</a><br>Just buy a shitbox car bro. <br><br><a href=\"#p91232718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91232718</a><br>A52s has card slot and headphone jack<br>Pixel has Graphene<br>Nothing 1 is a meme gimmick", "time": 1675113505, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91233669, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:42:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91232718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91232718</a><br>A52s", "time": 1675114923, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91233680, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:42:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "cracked my phone&#039;s screen, entire thing is now black. pixel 6.<br><br>should I buy a new phone, other new type of phone that isn&#039;t pixel 6, or fix it for 200 CAD?", "time": 1675114950, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91233831, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:47:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91231652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91231652</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not with end-to-end encryption turned on (which btw is an iPhone only feature)</span><br>Sucks to suck.", "filename": "Screenshot_20230130_164645_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1079, "h": 1760, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675115261860678, "time": 1675115261, "md5": "Z6biIBCLuRHLUWC40sjfnA==", "fsize": 600745, "resto": 91223461}, {"no": 91233873, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:48:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p91232354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;91232354</a><br>No. Get an A52s or A52 5G.

VLC defaults to neighbor for chroma and catrom for luma, mpv bilinear for both, and mpc I think catrom for both.

Also one of the drives which is brand new constantly get files corrupted, and this only happens when you boot the other windows 10 so it&#039;s not the drive malfunctioning.

Also it&#039;s even more weird, this issue only affect 3 drives, the other drives remain unaffected so far.

However, outside of the AirPods Max pretty much all the most popular ANC Bluetooth headphones are no longer prohibitively expensive like they used to be.
