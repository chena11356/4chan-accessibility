This one, though, made me question my sexuality a bit. I&#039;m not sure how it happened, but whenever I found myself looking at her Instagram posts I spent more and more time staring at her boyfriend in the pictures. One day she posted a picture of them at the beach. I stared at her in her bikini for only a second or two before my eyes wandered over to her boyfriend and my jaw dropped. He had a perfectly sculpted manly body. For the first time, I felt myself start to get an erection while looking at a picture of her Chad boyfriend. At first I was ashamed, but after a few nights I finally masturbated to the picture of him. From there it was a slippery slope to thinking about his cock and what I would do with it...<br><br><br>It was around this time that I also happened to see reddit&#039;s sissy community for the first time. Luckily for me, I have a very small frame - I&#039;m short and thin, with sloped shoulders and weak facial features, like nearly all incels. I tried on a few of my sister&#039;s bras and panties and from then there was no going back. Over the course of a few weeks, I ordered my own bras, panties, dresses, makeup, and finally a dildo. A few weeks later I was able to organize a meetup with a hot guy at my college.<br><br>Being on your knees with an alpha&#039;s cock between your lips is a feeling of indescribable bliss.<br><br>It feels so incredibly good to have the hatred of women lifted off your shoulders and replaced with an adoration of alpha males. I seriously urge all incels to accept their inner femininity and become the sissy girls they were meant to be. Servitude is the ultimate liberation for us. There is a massive untapped army of future sissies in the form of incels waiting to serve real men.

He was instantly struck by her beauty, but noticed that she seemed to be in a state of unease. He slowly walked closer, not wanting to startle her, and sat down next to her on the bench.<br><br>Mackenna was taken aback at first, but quickly caught on to what Mark was trying to do. She smiled up at him shyly, feeling a little bit more at ease with his presence.<br><br>Mark began to talk with Mackenna, asking her about her interests and hobbies. He wanted to get to know her better and make her feel comfortable around him. As they talked, Mark noticed that Mackenna wasn&#039;t quite comfortable presenting as a woman yet. He could tell that she was still in the process of transitioning and wanted so desperately to make her feel like she belonged.<br><br>So Mark began showing Mackenna small acts of kindness and attention. He would open doors for her, bring her coffee in the morning, compliment her outfit choices - anything he could think of that would make her feel special and loved. He even started calling her &quot;love&quot; as a term of endearment - something he had never done with any other girl before.<br><br>Mackenna started feeling more comfortable around Mark over time. She finally felt like someone was truly listening to her and understanding where she was coming from - something she hadn&#039;t felt in a very long time. She found it easy to talk to him about anything and everything, even things she wasn&#039;t sure if he would understand or accept.<br><br>At first, their relationship blossomed from friendship into something more romantic over time.
