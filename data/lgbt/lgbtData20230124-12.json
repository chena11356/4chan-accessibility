But according to Pernoud, women held some power before! This section highlights a few things:<br>&quot;[\u2026] certain women enjoyed in the Church, and due to their function in the Church, an extraordinary power in the Middle Ages. Some abbesses were authentic feudal lords, whose power was respected in the same way as that of other lords; the bishop; they often administered vast territories with villages, parishes...<br>\u201cIn notarial acts, it is very common to see a married woman act on her own, opening, for example, a shop or a business, and this without being obliged to present an authorization from her husband. Finally, the records of spills (we would say the records of recipients), when they were preserved for us, as is the case in Paris at the end of the 13th century, show a multitude of women who exercised professions: teacher, doctor, apothecary, educator, dyer, copyist, miniaturist, bookbinder, etc.\u201d<br>This, however, does not deny the inferiority of women in relation to men in the period, but women were not doomed only to domestic activities.<br>The fact is that the categories of compression of the Catholic Church, from its roots in primitive Christianity, never attributed to women any condition of inferiority or detention of sin in relation to men. Christianity understands that human beings, both women and men, are exposed to evil because they are free \u2013 they are free to accept or deny good, grace. Thus, in the social and ecclesiastical spheres of the Middle Ages, like men, women had a great influence. Society did not deny them space based on political-religious determinations.<br>That according to... Pernoud, a female historian.<br>And maybe political lesbianism is a problem...

Yes, I want to become a big, manly, musclebound guy but I have never jacked off to this thought or anything like that, it&#039;s not sexual. I do however have some level of autogynephilia, but it is exaggerated when picturing myself as being more masculine than I am now. I also have always envied how cis men could do feminine things and wear feminine clothing and look how they look, while I look like a woman if I do those things. It would not be a stretch to say that I want to look like a man so I can dress like a woman again. Not all the time, but y&#039;know.

When the inner critic tells you that you are not worthy or that you\u2019re not loved, remember that that voice does not belong to you\u2014that it does not possess any control over you.

If you have a loving family and partner, you\u2019re already leagues ahead of others. Never forget your strengths and innate value. You have worth.

Spare T metabolises into E2, and E2 shuts down your T production. What will happen is you get a week or two of high T, which fades into slightly high T and elevated E, which then fades back to your normal T levels as your body stabilises around the steroids you&#039;re taking. You&#039;d basically have to ramp up and replace your natural production entirely with supplemental T, and then you&#039;re still going to end up with elevated E (which is why steroid users grow boobs).<br><br>Your natural T production isn&#039;t determined by how much T there is in your blood, they&#039;re determined by how much E2 there is in your blood. Leftover T turns into E2. If you have a naturally low T level, that means your androgen receptors just aren&#039;t using more T than that, because enough T is left over to tell your testicles to ramp down. Barring things like damage to the testicles or hypothyroidism I don&#039;t know anything about, your blood will probably have as much T as your body needs.<br><br>I recommend you not play with steroids, and just get your body in shape with discipline and hard work. A good exercise regime will not only stabilise your circadian rhythm, making it easier to sleep properly, but it will also increase your body&#039;s androgen receptiveness, boosting how much T you can make use of, and thus also boosting how much T your body will produce. It&#039;ll also produce a lot of serotonin, which is basically a &quot;feel good&quot; hormone.", "time": 1674333345, "resto": 29269925}, {"no": 29275380, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:51:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Howdy.

Check the country you&#039;re travelling to, odds are you can pick up insulin syringes without a prescription at a pharmacy, that would be the safest option.<br><br>If you know someone with diabetes, ask if you can steal the label off one of their insulin bottles. You could put that on your estrogen vial for extra safety. Pack needles also if you&#039;re doing this. 10ml vials all look the same and diabetes is too common for them to bother asking for a prescription slip. If you do this you should bring the vial and the needles in your purse as hand luggage, to better pass as a diabetic.<br><br>Also, don&#039;t panic if they do take your estrogen. Just shoot up before you get to the airport. Assuming you&#039;re on enanthate, you&#039;ll miss your dosage by two weeks, but all that will happen is menopause, two weeks without E isn&#039;t enough to remasculate. Hot flashes aren&#039;t exactly pleasant, but they won&#039;t kill you.", "time": 1674563749, "resto": 29269925}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29311593, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:53:02", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "4 years on E, hsts tries to convince me to be her detrans bf", "com": "It&#039;s over it&#039;s over it&#039;s over<br><br>The worst part is that she mogs me.", "filename": "pepecide", "ext": ".png", "w": 602, "h": 449, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 186, "tim": 1674553982108683, "time": 1674553982, "md5": "rC9pl+QkyHiMJSdFmYUHpw==", "fsize": 215306, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "4-years-on-e-hsts-tries-to-convince-me-to-be-her", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29307404, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:17:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lil uzi is getting zestier by the minute tariq was right", "filename": "FnLrfnoXEAIH9uF", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1284, "h": 1557, "tn_w": 206, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674526645139167, "time": 1674526645, "md5": "oXO7UJXomQkXJp80fJZU5g==", "fsize": 261397, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lil-uzi-is-getting-zestier-by-the-minute-tariq", "replies": 17, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 29307419, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:18:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i dont care about your nigga rap shit retarded smoothbrain zoomer kys", "time": 1674526710, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307421, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:18:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "he most definitely hates fags like every other popular rapper does", "time": 1674526714, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307435, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:20:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lil bro think he ecco2k", "time": 1674526805, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307462, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:21:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29307404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29307404</a><br>Yeah lil Uzi is autistic NGL, worse than gambino", "time": 1674526890, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307634, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:32:02", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "ECDD8429-EC8C-4F1F-A80A-6F3CC4C3D689", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1599, "h": 2362, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674527522538292, "time": 1674527522, "md5": "T5fJeByPohLha/j49hIbnQ==", "fsize": 2408969, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307673, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29307404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29307404</a><br>Absolutely buck broken nigger.", "time": 1674527675, "resto": 29307404}, {"no": 29307754, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:39:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29307404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29307404</a><br>Imagine being black and spending all of your time worrying about not being or not doing anything gay.

Now that homophobia is not so open and shunned in many cases HSTS no longer bother transitioning and just opt to be overly flamboyant gay men.<br>And then we have the AGPs. Natal males that hate masculinity on such a degree that they want to absolutely eradicate it of off them. That effort is first and foremost pursued by transitioning but they might also pursue it through mannerisms as well (being a radfem man hater etc).
