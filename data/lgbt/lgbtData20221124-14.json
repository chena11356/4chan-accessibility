I&#039;m referring, and most respectfully, to inter-sexed people &amp; others of undefined sexuality. While it&#039;s true that someone can be a trans woman attracted to cis women, for example, or someone who identifies as either sex one day to the next, or any other permutation imaginable, these myriad self perceptions or attractions are all formed on the basis of two genders. <br> Also, most respectfully, I believe the idea that a woman or a man can be anything you want it to be is false. There is only one way of feeling like a woman or a man. Based on these feelings, your mind knows what image it wants to see when you look in the mirror. This expectation reflects your true gender. If you want to see a male image gazing back at you then you are male. Which ever gender you are attracted to is irrelevant. Whatever birth body you inhabit is irrelevant. <br> Now at this point, someone may try to sabotage the argument by claiming they want to see a male image in the mirror one day &amp; a female the next. Therefore I must be non-binary. Right? Wrong. Only one of them is your true gender while the other is merely the manifestation of a fetish identity. An identity you like to appropriate for one reason or another. Even if someone actually does possess a dual gender identity, that duality is still based on the idea of feeling male or female &amp; subjects will still use the terms male or female or man or woman to describe how they feel.", "time": 1669304768, "resto": 28477224}, {"no": 28482180, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:26:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "we need a feet tierlist", "filename":
