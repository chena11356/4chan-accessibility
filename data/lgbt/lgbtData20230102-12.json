The idea that anyone would transition is disgusting, and being horny temporarily reduces disgust sensitivity. Masturbation relieves me of disgusting temptations to do sexual things that are harmful, but also feeds the desires and makes them more complex through the creation of mind and muscle memories and habits, and the exposure to new sexual ideas. This has the desensitizing effect of breaking down my purity and opening my mind to more disgusting things to masturbate to, but also seems to conduct a mindset of creative flow that I do not tend to get when I abstain from masturbating, because I am not moving in a way that feels natural and habitual to me, and this &quot;nature&quot; itself is a result of habit formation caused by porn and mssturbation. Not masturbating gives me energy and anger and tension. It is good for a while, but eventually when I am feeling frustrated, bored, horny, or lacking in energy, or after seeing titillation, I will masturbate. After masturbating, I will usually masturbate more. The benefits of masturbating are less anger, increased immunity to seduction, and a greater chance of achieving a creative flow state, which is necessary for my creative pursuits. Which is better, to masturbate or not to masturbate?

as long as he&#039;s been alive. we also told him his first time was waaaaay better than ours. my gfs first time, the guy couldn&#039;t cum, he was too nervous. my first time i last a masterful... 20

And yet, too often, we fail to extend that love and acceptance to those who are trans. We discriminate against them, we deny them the right to live their lives authentically, and we even allow violence against them to go unpunished.<br><br>This is not the way of Christ. It is not the way of love.<br><br>We must remember that being trans is not a choice. It is an inherent aspect of a person&#039;s identity, and it is not something that can or should be changed or denied. To do so is to deny a person&#039;s very humanity.<br><br>As Christians, it is our duty to stand up for the rights of all people, including our trans siblings. We must speak out against discrimination and violence, and we must work to create a world where all people, regardless of their gender identity or expression, are treated with dignity and respect.<br><br>This is not an easy task. It will require us to challenge our own biases and prejudices, and it will require us to stand up to those who would deny the rights of our trans siblings.

One of their primary identities was that they were neither male nor female, but all were \u201cone\u201d through different lived, experienced realities of gender pluralism. Women, and a significant number of men, rejected both male dominance and female passivity. A wide swath of Jesus groups rejected marriage and traditional families, with the envoy Paul often leading the way. Although some Anointed groups and individuals supported male dominance and demanded female obedience to men, many men shifted toward acting more vulnerable and less domineering. Women cut their hair and dressed like men. These gendered activities and actions brokered new possibilities for identity among various Jesus peoples, well beyond the regular masculine/feminine dichotomies of the first two centuries.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They Lived in Chosen Families </span><br>With traditional families increasingly broken and dispersed, a variety of Jesus groups started living in experimental family groups. These new family groups were voluntary; that is, they lived together increasingly outside of blood or married relationships. Whereas previously the primary relations for living arrangements were extended families of multiple generations with cousins, aunts, and uncles in the mix, Jesus people associated daily with each other according to mutual support and affection. More and more \u201csupper clubs\u201d became crucial and core associations of daily life. Economic sharing provided ways that members of these groups bonded. In some cases, larger housing arrangements came into play for the groups through a donor exhibiting compassion. Although most of these new kinds of families were small, occasionally a wealthy person provided larger space for bigger groups", "time": 1672659998, "resto": 29009923}, {"no": 29010161, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)07:03:11", "name": "smug_femboy", "com": "anxiety and depression most likely, I have to wonder what makes somebody reject the gifts they were given this badly. the lord doesn&#039;t make mistakes", "filename": "kasumin.mp4_snapshot_00.09", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672660991298926, "time": 1672660991, "md5": "G4Xfs/tCTtt0GLXVbo2FDQ==", "fsize": 1644415, "resto": 29009923, "trip": "!478flABma6"}, {"no": 29010194, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)07:08:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Society.

For volume you can blow dry upside down or you can lift your roots up and then blow cold air into it.<br><br>What is so funny is that oils didn&#039;t work on my hair either, but the area they do work anon is at the ends of your hairs. Just put a bit of oil when it is wet and scrunch it at the end. It helps to hydrate the ends.<br><br>Keep in mind every product I recommend to you I have used. The olaplex is expensive, and there are better alternatives just make sure your hair serum/ wave enhancer/ is lightweight so No silicones, heat protectant. I chose these products because it seems you don&#039;t want to enhance your waves and instead make it sleeker.

My boyfriend then jumped out and closed the door ASAP and continued our drive home. I had dash cam footage of where I jerked forward and ran the red light. But it obviously couldn&#039;t capture the man at the side of the car trying to get in...<br><br>I&#039;m sure the man was drunk and thought it would be hilarious to climb into a stranger&#039;s car, but it was fucking terrifying. I don&#039;t know what I would have done if my boyfriend wasn&#039;t there. My mind was just telling me &quot;running a red light is illegal, don&#039;t do it&quot; but THERE WAS A FUCKING STRANGE MAN TRYING TO GET INTO MY CAR. I just feel like I would have let it happen and I don&#039;t know what I would have done with myself.<br><br>When we got home I was still in shock for a while. I remember having an intense feeling of worthlessness and cried. To that man, I was probably a joke, or maybe he had some malicious intent. I hate that he could invade a space I thought was safe so easily and just make my self-worth crumble.", "filename": "menhera-chan-angry", "ext": ".gif", "w": 220, "h": 212, "tn_w": 220, "tn_h": 212, "tim": 1672655001209885, "time": 1672655001, "md5": "ijeXKSCJ1Pdtx9CKv7suUQ==", "fsize": 54159, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "a-man-tried-to-climb-into-my-car-while-i-was", "replies": 7, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 29009588, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:24:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why didnt your bf punch him", "time": 1672655073, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29009597, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009581</a><br>tldr move your blog to Blogpost", "filename": "1672497231709644", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 255, "h": 247, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672655196411610, "time": 1672655196, "md5": "wKjW4D+Z1NXnL/L2UdScJA==", "fsize": 15257, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29009614, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:32:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009597</a><br>off yourself chasoid", "time": 1672655570, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29009674, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:45:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009614</a><br>maybe try locking your car doors? how fucking stupid are you anyway, to blog post about you being stupid?", "time": 1672656330, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29009709, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)05:52:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009588</a><br>this. wtf do you have bf for if not for situations like this.", "time": 1672656740, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29009836, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:11:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009581</a><br>To set your doors to lock when you speed up you sometimes have to open and close the door and hold buttons on the remote for a certain amount of time while turning the wheels in a certain direction, it&#039;s wild<br><br>Anyways yea if you&#039;re a burger get a gun lmao<br><br>I just got a new car and I put a hammer under my seat, and some nails...<br><br>Also this has nothing to do with being trans, clearly that is your entire personality", "time": 1672657884, "resto": 29009581}, {"no": 29010041, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)06:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29009581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29009581</a><br>Get one of those emergency hatchets to keep under your seat.

The idea that anyone would transition is disgusting, and being horny temporarily reduces disgust sensitivity. Masturbation relieves me of disgusting temptations to do sexual things that are harmful, but also feeds the desires and makes them more complex through the creation of mind and muscle memories and habits, and the exposure to new sexual ideas. This has the desensitizing effect of breaking down my purity and opening my mind to more disgusting things to masturbate to, but also seems to conduct a mindset of creative flow that I do not tend to get when I abstain from masturbating, because I am not moving in a way that feels natural and habitual to me, and this &quot;nature&quot; itself is a result of habit formation caused by porn and masturbation. Not masturbating gives me energy and anger and tension. It is good for a while, but eventually when I am feeling frustrated, bored, horny, or lacking in energy, or after seeing titillation, I will masturbate. After masturbating, I will usually masturbate more. The benefits of masturbating are less anger, increased immunity to seduction, and a greater chance of achieving a creative flow state, which is necessary for my creative pursuits. Which is better, to masturbate or not to masturbate?

they can just go to work, watch tv, do exactly as society demands of them in terms of their gender, never think about it, never think about anything, and then you get a hollow shitty american middle class life.<br><br>who fucking cares, you get a gender dysphoria diagnosis when you have to lie to your doctor about wearing a dress when you were 1 year old and lying about intricate fantasies you didnt have while jacking off<br>gender dysphoria is only helpful as shorthand as to not have to explain the inner workings of your brain and heart anytime anyone asks you whats wrong.<br>if i ask 10 trans people to describe in depth what gender dysphoria is to them ill get 10 different answers. yall just sit on 4chan all day playing make believe arm chair doctor. anyone who isnt trutrans or whatever will obviously just lie to conform to the standards set in order to do the thing they want to do. doesnt seem very helpful", "time": 1672626459, "resto": 29000449}, {"no": 29005143, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29005061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29005061</a><br>&quot;oh well i didnt scream and cry and piss and shit and moan 24/7 from the ripe age of 0 about the gender i was assigned at birth outwardly to everyone in my life trying to kill myself every single day, so i guess im normal!&quot; and then they never have to look themselves in the eye and examine who they are and who they want to be.<br>boring fucking world yall want, boring as fuck. boring, unhelpful, meaningless. but atleast you get to jack off about how much of an epic real tranny yall are on 4chan.org. have fun living this fufilling, epic life as a real deal bonfied genuine trans because some piece of shit doctor decided your answers were good enough on this particular day. i wonder how many of you stretch the truth of your experience as to conform to the idea of what a trans person is &quot;supposed&quot; to be, dictated by cis people who hate you anyway", "time": 1672626792, "resto": 29000449}, {"no": 29005148, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:33:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29005061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29005061</a><br>trans women are gay men in denial <br>stop enabling homophobia", "time": 1672626830, "resto": 29000449}, {"no": 29005189, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:36:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29005143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29005143</a><br>based.", "time": 1672627019, "resto": 29000449}, {"no": 29005303, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)21:47:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29000449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29000449</a><br>I want to have secondary sexual characteristics of the opposite sex very, very badly.

In the event of a job loss, over a third of households would be unable to pay the coming month\u2019s rent. It might, especially in an economic downturn, be difficult to find another job of the same quality, pay or location.
