Only other problem with the rules imho is that netrunners are just playing an entirely different game from everyone else and that makes the game take 2x as long and everyone else just has to sit around and watch them have fun for 15 minutes. Also the executive class doesnt make a lot of sense from a &quot;cyberpunk&quot; point of view and doesnt have a place in the game imo. Besides that I just have some minor concerns. Like for example fashionware is 100% free in character creation and you can get techhair and techskin with your fashion money to get +2 to your personal grooming skill absolutely for free which is just kind of an obviously stupid oversight. Also Wolvers which are 3d6 2rof concealable melee cost the same as a 2d6 2rof concealable melee for no reason whatsoever, the nails are just a strict downgrade 100%.

I just think it&#039;s your job as someone writing and selling a rule book to make the rules of the games, and it should be the DM&#039;s job to make the stories. Forcing the DM to come up with rules on the fly on top of coming up with a narrative and responding to players&#039; obscene spontaneous bs is ridiculous and putting to heavy of a load on them. Like if you want the rules to be abstact dont make language fluency a numerical skill in game if there is no written system for how it works. Thats just inexcusable. Like it would be so easy to come up with one as well. Like make it<br>1 - know some words<br>2 - slow and awkward at language<br>3 - basic literacy <br>4 - fluency<br>5 - mastery / native passing<br>6 - further knowledge than primary language speaker.<br>Boom put that in your book. But since it isnt in the book now the player has to make a sheet and decide how many points they need in streetslang to be able to understand what everyone in Night City is saying all the time, and the DM is gonna be the asshole when they disappoint the player by making the game more difficult for them.

Science is thus a set of virtues, as Merton, Popper, Shapin, Galison, Daston, Foucault &amp; others argue. What\u2019s more, social facts are often discursive &amp; public in nature (Searle), epistemically and/or ontologically real (Searle, Haslanger, Epstein, Mirowski), taken for granted, epistemically performed (MacKenzie, Barad) &amp; always involve truth &amp; power (Foucault, Harraway, Jasanoff). Uniting this is the idea of pragmatics\u2014pragmatics is the realm of context, force &amp; intent\u2014Austin/Grice/Searle\u2019s implicature, Peirce\u2019s index, Wittgenstein\u2019s way of life, Bakhtin\u2019s heteroglossia, Jakobson/Labov\u2019s referentiality (&amp; arguably Saussure\u2019s parole, Chomsky\u2019s performance). And, elaborating on that, meta-pragmatics, coined by Michael Silverstein, concerns the way language is used to specify correct use, to specify how to relate to context &amp; intent, and instruct people on the proper social/extra discursive aspects of communication &amp; discourse. At the end of the day, the definitions of words (semantics) &amp; their baptism (meta semantics), the correct use of syntax, logical operators &amp; rules, the correct way to take turns, use dialects, dispute &amp; justify intent, reference &amp; logic are all meta pragmatics\u2014there\u2019s no outside.<br><br>If i had my way all scientists would be tortured by requiring them to take the philosophy of science, the history of science, the sociology of science, the history of the philosophy of science &amp; the philosophy of history of science lol", "time": 1672563178, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993707, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)03:56:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993689</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Name dropping and word salad is supposed to have meaning</span>", "time": 1672563401, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993736, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993707</a><br>u 2 dumb", "time": 1672563685, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993746, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:03:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993581</a><br>Virgin illiterate chud<br>HS drop out <br><br><a href=\"#p28993689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993689</a><br>Chad well-read troon<br>Hrt powered intelligence", "time": 1672563801, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993755, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:04:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993166</a><br>kinda grew up with it. my parents are both biology professors.", "time": 1672563878, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993765, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:06:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993755</a><br>Are they famous?", "time": 1672563964, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993772, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:07:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993765</a><br>no not really. more focused on the teaching end than the research end, their students really love them though", "time": 1672564026, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993800, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:11:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993707</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your opinions are supposed to have meaning?</span>", "time": 1672564295, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993836, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:19:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993736</a><br>You said literally nothing lol", "time": 1672564742, "resto": 28993166}, {"no": 28993843, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28993746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28993746</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hrt powered intelligence</span><br>Kek.

How do you expect conservatives, who want to be far away and removed from LGBTQ+ bullshit as possible, to just shrug their shoulders and accept when you bring yourselves around their own flesh and blood? In the context of these drag shows, there is in no world where anyone pre 2008 would have ever accepted what is touted and flaunted around at these weird ass drag shows and children drag readings. You must think conservatives are just fucking retarded to let you impress upon their kids that you weirdos (which you are, by definition of your small relative population, nothing wrong with that) that no, you&#039;re actually normal.

He wants to transition even though he has never really experienced what it&#039;s like to be a woman. He&#039;s never been on a date with a man (or woman) who loves them, and he doesn&#039;t care. His deadbeat, dead addict father molested him, so now he doesn&#039;t want to be a woman anymore.

In essence, not to harass me to &#039;quit estrogen&#039; because I am &#039;ruining my body&#039; and &#039;you&#039;re a fine young man.&#039; I think it is really the bare minimum I am asking for in terms of understanding. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s always some shit like &quot;I&#039;d see what having boobs/a penis is like&quot; or &quot;I&#039;d go into a public restroom and use a urinal&quot; or some other more general curiosity oriented ideas. </span><br>In my experience it has always been &quot;that would be awful I would hate having boobs that would be wrong,&quot; which (should) work well for my purposes. I guess it depends on how seriously they take the prompt. <br><br>The rest is a fair point. I did not try that precise approach because in my case, my parents were very hung up on the fact that I was actively taking estrogen, an adulterant, that is not natural for me to have in those quantities.", "time": 1672529280, "resto": 28984291}, {"no": 28988334, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)18:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28984291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28984291</a><br>Willful ignorance, and strongly biased hatred. Also being brainwashed with spoon fed manufactured opinions. <br>They pretend to &quot;understand&quot; us because it&#039;s a way to deceptively seem &quot;credible&quot; when trying to push their emotional opinions. Transphobes are narcissists most of the time, so their manipulation and gaslighting isn&#039;t any surprise.

Relying on others in regards to self worth just feels disingenuous. But as far as living as a woman in some sense, it just feels normal for me. It&#039;s not that big of a deal. The hormones are fair enough. Any efforts regarding feminine appearance, are just a matter of personal taste, no different from anyone else expressing personal taste with what matches their style/personality on some level. Behaviorally, I don&#039;t follow any cultural norms or have this mindset of generically acting or thinking certain ways &quot;because stereotypical women are like that herpderp&quot;. I&#039;m sort of more androgynous as far as any feedback I&#039;ve heard on the matter from friends. I don&#039;t ask anyone since it&#039;s awkward and would feel forced. Things just come up at any time in flow of conversation. What&#039;s odd, is the feminine thought process, mannerisms, and behavior is more linked to the psychological effects of using estrogen. It&#039;s subconscious and happens whether I can control it or not. Due to boy-moding most of the time I get self conscious of the feminine behavior which can&#039;t be helped. So I just stopped caring since that&#039;s something outside of my range of control. And it&#039;s illogical to stress over what one can&#039;t control.

I get the best results when I&#039;m being dicked down, having a guy bite/suck/kiss my nips, neck kissing, being pinned down as if hunted down like prey, running his hands down my thighs, lip biting, having my boobs groped, when he stops thrusting and I can feel his cock throbbing and twitching inside etc. In short, sensuality is a big part of it. At least for me. But yeah, When said guy makes me cum (bf or fwb), I can feel it hitting like soft waves, almost throughout my whole body. Depending on how well he keeps going, I can feel complete ecstasy for 5-12min. Sort of feels like I&#039;m getting hotter and melting. <br><br>Compared to the male orgasm where they seem to want to rush it. If you&#039;re on estrogen with the right dose long enough, take it slow. A vibrator and starting with a fairly small 3-5in dildo can help.
