Obviously, the power to take life or to cause extreme suffering is a form of power, and men embrace this power fully when they torture and kill animals, girls and women, and each other. Where boys and men are obsessed with death and creating destruction, women are left to perform damage control, utilizing all their time, energy and resources on mitigating the harm that men inflict; women are then left with few or no resources to use towards building a female-centered culture or to support our own interests. This diversion of women\u2019s resources away from woman-centered and non-patriarchal ends is deliberate. The unusual man who is even slightly interested in nurturing or preserving life is the beneficiary of enormous false gratitude, but when women make a mistake or are unable to perform caretaking duties at a high level for any reason, we are severely punished by patriarchal institutions which place extreme controls on women\u2019s lives and enforce our caretaking role with institutional violence, including incarceration. Of course, it is frequently men\u2019s necrophilic actions such as PIV-centric sexuality creating unwanted or ambivalent children, or men harming themselves and others, that create the need for women\u2019s usually unpaid, institutionally-unsupported caretaking labor in the first place, and opening the door to patriarchal institutional control over women\u2019s lives.

Normally we would all think this advice would come from some loser with obvious complex&#039;s he&#039;s trying to cover up for, but now the guy saying it was some gigachad (in aesthetics at least). I blame a couple groups for his rise. Women being a lot grosser than I remember them being, just outright whores or shallow. Tinder did not help. Second is Media, they basically used super antibiotics to get rid of this guy (kicking him off platforms ect), but low and behold he developed some type of resistance to it. I suppose third would be basedboys who idk maybe never saw women for what they are so it really is an alien form of thinking. either way, he got popular because he was saying taboo cringe shit and people who couldn&#039;t handle it (women) took it seriously, so everyone including his half-assed fans took him seriously.

There&#039;s about 5.7 bunkers per km^2, or about 15 per mile^2. <br><br>I won&#039;t go into the specific kinds of bunkers, because we&#039;re definitely already in autism math territory now, but what&#039;s important is there&#039;s 3 types, all of which are prefabricated and made of concrete and steel with a shape where the above-ground portion is a dome-shape. <br>The first category is about 10 feet in diameter, so roughly 78 square feet of floorspace.<br>The second is about 26 feet in diameter, so roughly 530 square feet of floorspace.<br>The third category are special structures, usually for government agencies, which as I understand are generally pretty big, or entire complexes, the largest of these were mountain-bases. There&#039;s also a bunch of tunnels. <br>These are all rough estimates, but given many are now used as coffee shops, houses for the homeless, hostels and so on, it doesn&#039;t seem unrealistic, at the very least.<br><br>There&#039;s also a museum from an old one in the capital thats about 77000 square feet, so they can get pretty big, but most of those will be centred in the capital, or near secret-police locations.

I was thinking she could be a slightly psychopathic alcoholic bpdemon youngshit gigapassoid. I was thinking she would also be super into plushies (including the famous shark himself!) and maybe do a Patrick Bateman impression at some point. Being so incredibly mentally ill and a tranny would also explain why she dresses like a medieval fantasy stripper other than the obvious male gaze animez waifu bait. It would make her a way better character and make her eventual relationship with Kirito more complex, which tbf isn&#039;t hard since they&#039;re bland self-insert characters.<br><br>I had other ideas for SAO like how they should&#039;ve made Kirito a lot edgier (although Abridged did this pretty well so I won&#039;t repeat it) as a kid and then have him mellow out as he grows up. Also, Laughing Coffin should&#039;ve gotten their own episode where the top guilds all band together and purge them. I think they should&#039;ve made them Nazis too, like imagine if a few dozen /pol/ users were given demi-god powers in a world with no rules, they&#039;d immediately turn into them. I also think they should&#039;ve leaned very heavily into psychologically tormenting the characters and the audience, as the point of media is to make those groups suffer. This could be accomplished by having those groups experience the characters watching people they care about die, having to kill other people (like Laughing Coffin) in life or death consequences, having the characters all display signs of PTSD since they&#039;re basically teenagers in a death game watching all their friends die, etc. What do you think?", "filename": "sao", "ext": ".jpg", "w":
