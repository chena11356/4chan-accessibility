It will stress you out and demoralize you. (I believe males tell each other this as a form of intrasexual competition, kind of like how females tell each other they&#039;re fat sluts.) It is also probably not true, even if you get rejected a lot. Adopt a position of calm neutrality to your attractiveness.<br><br>You are not actually looking for \u2018any\u2019 girl, you are looking for 1 girl from the population of maybe 1% of people you will get along with and experience mutual attraction. Based on your description of yourself as a cis male who naturally leans femme, here is some advice:<br><br>-Try to get adopted by a friend group of weird girls if you do not have one already. I\u2019m not sure how my friend groups keeps finding our \u201cone weird guy\u201d\u2026the best I can tell is that they just show up somehow, it turns out they share our interests, and we like them so they keep getting invited back.<br>-You are on the short side, but thin. This is fine. Your reverse type is probably bisexual women (often medium-tall, thin, autist women). They care less about height but they care more about you being prosocial. You will learn how to be prosocial from your friend group of weird girls. <br>-Make sure you have at least one male friend too. They balance you out. Don\u2019t forget that you are male.<br>-Online dating is a waste of time in my opinion.

In those nightmares, I was a young boy, and an adult woman sexually assaulted me. She&#039;d pin me down and ride me. Even if I struggled, she was strong and wouldn&#039;t budge. She&#039;d say it&#039;s futile to resist anyway, so I may as well try to enjoy it. But even if I tried to, I felt so horribly violated, and began to cry, and then she&#039;d call me a failure and berate me for not appreciating her, but continued anyway, mocking me for the ways in which my body reacted. I&#039;d have this nightmare several times a year.<br><br>When I was 22, I learned to meditate. Since then, I&#039;ve had much more control over my dreams, so even if she appeared, I stopped her from doing anything sexual.<br><br>I often wondered if the nightmares meant anything. For example, the way my body reacted in them made me wonder if I might be attracted to women, but I don&#039;t seem to be. Was it perhaps a metaphor for my insecurity in my masculinity? I always found it puzzling, and it left me feeling increasingly spiteful.<br><br>Three weeks ago, I underwent sex reassignment surgery as I&#039;ve had gender dysphoria since my childhood. A week after the surgery, I experienced sleep paralysis in the morning, and she appeared. Although I was annoyed to see her, I neither feared nor resisted her this time, and taunted her in my mind: &quot;Nothing stopped you before when I was this defenseless, so come at me.&quot; She got on top of me as usual; her thighs felt warm and soft. She tried to reach for my penis, but it wasn&#039;t there. I taunted her again: &quot;So, do you still insist on violating me? Aren&#039;t you gonna try to make me feel good? Go on, I dare you.&quot; Then, she disappeared as the sleep paralysis ended with me breaking out into laughter. My fianc\u00e9 asked why I was laughing, and I told him I had a funny dream.<br><br>I doubt nightmares &quot;count&quot; as being sexually assaulted but it&#039;s honestly a huge relief to know I can&#039;t be forced to penetrate someone.

Within Catholic bioethics, it seems to me that HRT would be justifiable treatment as multiple studies have shown its ability to reduce distress associated with GD. Of course, if one takes a &#039;conservative&#039; (within Catholic theology) view on gender it is coupled with the impossibility of transition, but one cannot preclude HRT nonetheless. St. Aquinas wrote that crossdressing is broadly sinful &quot;since this may be a cause of sensuous pleasure&quot;, however it is permitted &quot;on account of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive&quot; (ST, II-II, q. 169, art. 2 ad. 1); it seems to me that with GD would be permitted under this, as the goal is not sensuous pleasure but to alievate GD and to prevent serious and negative consequences. &quot;For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes&quot; (Luke 12:23). So repressing is not advisable nor in itself virtuous. Neither are these &#039;perversions&#039; sinful in itself, thoughts cannot be sinful - the question is if acting on them can be.", "time": 1668693007, "resto": 28387719}, {"no": 28393909, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:02:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28387719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28387719</a><br>Before the 2000s, all Transsexuals came from very religious families", "time": 1668693757, "resto": 28387719}, {"no": 28393926, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Catholic Church has no real policy on trans people, leading to a contradictory and polarising treatment of such people within the Church. As it stands, the Holy Tradition does not give any clear indication of it either. The notion of a male body and a female soul is heretic and has been condemned, as the soul is the form of the body. However, it seems to me that the possibility of transition is still possible. GD in my view should be classified as a &quot;second intent&quot; of nature. Aquinas classifies between I personally believe that dysphoria should be classified as a &quot;Second Intent&quot; of Nature\u2014for Aquinas, the Natural Law has primary intentions ((re-)production of life, happiness, spiritual growth) and secondary intentions (state, warfare, slavery). The second intention are negative, however fulfil a role in formation of history and man&#039;s salvation. GD denotes psychological distress, with partly biological origins. To be male or female cannot simply be reduced to one&#039;s biology, as the evidence shows there are plethora of cases which undermine it. GD is a case of for example a male genitalia (an organ) being in contradiction with one&#039;s brain (another organ) - with transitioning taking the role of one&#039;s subject-formation, of becoming one&#039;s self; transitioning is in fact, for perhaps the first time in the subject&#039;s life, taking responsibility of who they are, what gender they express, and what place they&#039;ll carve out for themselves in the world.
