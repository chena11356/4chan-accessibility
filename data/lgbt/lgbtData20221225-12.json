In the 1970&#039;s, drag queen is again defined as a &quot;homosexual transvestite&quot;.

They have even been reported as having &quot;voluptuous breasts&quot; (Roy Hertz et al., 1966; Valentine, 1969; Polani, 1970). John McLean Morris, the gynecologist who reviewed and summarized all of the existing scientific literature on CAIS women in 1953 (including 82 cases) and gave their condition the (now-obsolete) name &quot;testicular feminization&quot;, described their breasts as &quot;unusually large&quot; and &quot;jumbo-sized&quot; (Morris, 1953; Quigley et al., 1995). He additionally said in his famous 1953 review that they had &quot;normal female breasts, often with a tendency to be overdeveloped&quot; (Morris, 1953). In actuality however, some CAIS women have large breasts while some have small breasts (Wisniewski et al., 2000), and we have no clear data that their breasts are in fact larger on average.

Some people regain all their hair, some regain none. If it&#039;s been ten years, though, I think you may be out of luck. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s common to regain more than a year or two worth of hair loss. HRT may not stop your hair loss at all, just look at the boomer trannies and IT&#039;S MA&#039;AMs who started late in life and probably had pretty high test before, the damage is already done. FtMs who detransition naturally produce E and they don&#039;t regain their lost hair either. Definitely a case of you want to start as early as possible.<br><br>If hair is all you care about though, you don&#039;t need E, and it probably shouldn&#039;t be anywhere near the top of the list of options. E inhibits hair loss as a side effect, the actual thing that stops hair loss is low testosterone. Higher E levels will dampen your T, that&#039;s how monotherapy works, but E will have other effects, including breasts, which is going to be a problem if you want to present as conventionally masculine. No, it&#039;s not as simple as &quot;I&#039;ll just bind if they get too big&quot;, you&#039;ll also get a different weight distribution and skin oils, people will notice, and binding isn&#039;t comfortably even with a smaller chest. <br><br>I suggest you do what the rich people do, get a hair transplant and take an antiandrogen. You can do the transplant in Thailand or Turkey or somewhere to save money on that (but it&#039;s still quite expensive, save up), and buy Chinese fina or Brazilian antiandrogen pills to selfmedicate. You don&#039;t have to be Elon to afford it. And yeah, Elon and the other rich people fighting hair loss are definitely messing with their hormones, just look closely at the pictures and you&#039;ll recognise elements they have in common with transitioning.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy.

It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH</span>", "time": 1671844491, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28880801, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:15:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28880465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28880465</a><br>Yeah, once i puncture it once and another when i flipped it over<br>Also, is otokonokopharma still alive?

I think there are also cases where hondosed mtfs get really big breasts on low doses of oral E, but little progress in anything else. <br>A lot of this comes from dr. powers, who is an advocate for the idea that estrone is important for early breast growth, and that estrone should be the dominant hormone until tanner 3. <br>But as you can see from that study, there isn&#039;t a lot of actual evidence to support it. <br>I think the best way to go about it is probably just to transition normally as well as you can, and then after a year or two when you&#039;re on monotherapy, if your breast growth isn&#039;t satisfactory you can always add 1mg oral E or something, which apparently has been effective in other people.

Also check out https://transfemscience.org/article<wbr>s/transfem-intro/<br><br>The basics is, if you take any estrogen at all, you are going to develop breasts, which doesn&#039;t sound like something you&#039;re interested in. Heightened levels of estrogen will furthermore suppress your testosterone production, to the extent that a large dose (called estradiol monotherapy) can essentially block it entirely.<br>You can try taking only an antiandrogen (cypro will probably be the easiest and best option). You won&#039;t &quot;feminise&quot;, but you will &quot;de-masculinise&quot;. It&#039;ll kill your libido (it&#039;s literally chemical castration) and make erections very rare, but that&#039;s reversible if you just stop taking the medication. Over prolonged time it&#039;s going to cause brittle bones and other health issues associated with menopause, so bear that in mind and live healthy. Don&#039;t try to do this with bica, that one doesn&#039;t actually stop test production, just your body&#039;s ability to make use of it. All the leftover testosterone turns into estrogen and you&#039;ll grow tits.<br>Testosterone is the stuff that builds muscles, so without it you&#039;re going to build muscle at more or less the same rate a woman does, which is significantly slower, but you do keep any muscle you already have, and also your masculine bone structure. Even if you go full MtF HRT you&#039;ll be stronger than just about any natural female. If you keep up your exercise you won&#039;t lose muscle, but you may lose your appetite (or gain a lot of it), and you will find it difficult to build new muscle. <br><br>Needless to say, if you plan to have children, it&#039;s best to do that before you start messing with your hormones. And even if you don&#039;t want kids, at least go to a sperm bank. If in the future you change your mind, you&#039;ll be happy you did. In theory stopping the medication will eventually return your sperm count, but testicular atrophy is a case of better safe than sorry.", "time": 1671970922, "resto": 28875004}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28897990, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:00:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unpassing lateshit honmoder</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go in public</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need to shit really bad</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use the womens bc i need to</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;on the toilet, wait until i&#039;m alone and just let it all out</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;before i&#039;m able to wash my hands and make my escape, a cis woman enters</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all she can say is &quot;oh god&quot; as she enters the small two stall bathroom</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;entrenched with fear, i wait for her to finish whatever she&#039;s doing and then leave once i&#039;m sure i won&#039;t be spotted</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mission success, nobody knows i&#039;m a tranny</span>", "filename": "hehehe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 218, "h": 232, "tn_w": 218, "tn_h": 232, "tim": 1671969612655888, "time": 1671969612, "md5": "WV2tKCazqTsIPwOVlNIk4A==", "fsize": 9899, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "be-me", "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 28898020, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why did she say &quot;oh god&quot; ?

right at the Christmas Eve party and I very seriously decided to kill myself that night because I thought things looked so hopeless - I thought telling them was just insurmountable and I thought there
