Also pragmatic is continuing to present straight: morals aside, society largely doesn&#039;t (and like never will) view queers in as good of a light as otherwise; this permeates to the subconscious, even (perhaps especially) among those milquetoast liberals who tacitly espouse the popular liberal virtues of acceptance and whatnot.

I&#039;m a person who has a hatred towards gays, homosexuals and trannies. I see them as people who are negatively affecting society in a much negative way. I&#039;m very right leaning in political beliefs, like Jewish hatred and more and I believe in Heaven, Hell, God, and homosexuality being a sin. However I feel I have a problem with myself with these issues. Not only to I masturbate often to traps, trannies and whatnot, but I feel I&#039;m getting romantic feelings towards a tranny online who is an emotional wreck with their &quot;gender identity&quot; and all that. We will play video games online, and we have such a blast playing with each other. Literal laughing till we struggle to breathe and are coughing. However I think I&#039;m starting to feel romantic and sexual attraction to them. We click so much, we enjoy each others company, and we get along so very well. They have even said they&#039;re the only one that they enjoy talking to me, and not only that, wonder why I even bother talking to them &quot;knowing me&quot; for my right and even extreme ideology. I genuinely like playing with them but I&#039;m starting to have these feelings for them and I don&#039;t know what to really do. I know what they look like but they don&#039;t know what I look like nor my possible true feelings about them. I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m trying to do by typing and posting this. A form of sin confession, a 2nd opinion, a coping mechanism or a combination of both. They live in canada and if I knew they were closer I feel I would meet up with them and would try to have sex with them and see where it goes from there. I&#039;m very confused and scared of these feelings and feel I&#039;ve may&#039;ve fallen for some brainwashing or feelings that I should not have.
