That&#039;s where I started with deconstruction. Descartes came to the same conclusion - at the end of the day, there&#039;s something producing thoughts, that then acts on those thoughts. That &quot;being&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;id/superego&quot;, or whatever you want to call it would be the absolute core of who you are underneath everything. But just identifying it as that doesn&#039;t describe anything but where it is, so it&#039;s still kind of this formless, unknown void - that&#039;s difficult to say &quot;ah, yeah, that&#039;s me.&quot;<br><br>You have different thoughts, make different choices, etc than others, even more so in the case of BPD. It&#039;s not purely immediate environmental factors causing those differences either; it&#039;s pretty readily obvious that people are not all individually the same exact &quot;being&quot; underneath it all, and that reflects outwardly.<br>So, mapping out, describing, and understanding what that core force you see is (consciousness) in relation to others is how you can start to really define &quot;who you are&quot;. At the end of the day, it&#039;s always there, and you can feel that it&#039;s something like a &quot;conductor&quot; for everything else. You can describe that conductor with substantial effort.<br>Anyway, you have the right idea and are looking in the right place. Where you&#039;re focused now is what you want to map out and understand. If nothing else existed outside of your &quot;being&quot; - no thoughts, world, anything - it would be hard to say whether or not it exists.
