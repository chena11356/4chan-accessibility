But I still disagree with what they say because my rl experience tells me that I don&#039;t pass and people view me as very fem gay guy.<br>Like, the last guy I dated was genuinely shocked when he saw me in a bikini (before we started dating). As it turned out, the night before when we met and talked at 7/11 for the first time, I helped him to buy a SIM card, he just thought I was a fag even though I wasn&#039;t even wearing a bra, and everyone could clearly see the outline of my booba through my tanktop, see picrel :v <br>That&#039;s how little I pass, I don&#039;t pass at all.

The buffet and beer was working its way through me and the large diarrheas resulted in gravy leg all over my thighs.

I don&#039;t like the cops so I get angry around them and wind up using my man voice. I remember yelling &quot;Come at me bro!&quot; and got tased and that took me down. It sucked, but I ripped it out of my leg and got back up because I was so high on drugs. I grabbed a squeegee and swung it like a sword and got tased again in my chest. That one really sucked and each time they shocked me I wound up shitting more. They moved in and handcuffed me and I promised to shit more in their car which I did. In processing they took my diaper and tiara which made me cry and I continued to make large diarrheas in my jail pants. They said they didn&#039;t have any diapers and I informed them that was going to be their problem.

That&#039;s why you need to use lube or talcum powder for storing and dressing aid. Usually nowadays people go for lube only since it makes the latex shiny, and isn&#039;t bad for storage. Tho I&#039;ve heard people say that talcum powder is better for long term storage. Rn I just have latex socks and gloves that I have (pretty longterm) stored with lube but them tearing or smth feels unlikely but I honestly haven&#039;t tried them on in a hot bit cuz it doesn&#039;t rly feel the same w/o a full suit (and I do have latex leggings but I&#039;m not sure if i stored them w/ talcum powder or lube and also where they are but idrc cuz I got them pretransition and they were pretty cheap)", "time": 1673963778, "resto": 29216661}, {"no": 29218048, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)09:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29218000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29218000</a><br>Post latex <br>Also where are some good places to get", "time": 1673964246, "resto": 29216661}, {"no": 29218055, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)09:05:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29218048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29218048</a><br>Thanks for the detailed reply btw screenshotted for future reference", "time": 1673964307, "resto": 29216661}, {"no": 29218593, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)10:12:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29218048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29218048</a><br>don&#039;t rly have any pics I can easily find nor would I be comfortable sharing (since they&#039;d be pretransition) but for places to get uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<wbr>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<wbr>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<wbr>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i mean with what I&#039;ve got, my socks and gloves are from uniqdsn, they&#039;re pretty good, esp for the price.

It&#039;s definitely (weirdly to say) a kink that means a lot to me cuz it&#039;s been smth i&#039;ve been into for a long ass time, way longer than i realized I was trans (which was 20) so I kindaa also associate it w/ the &quot;person&quot; i was pretransition?
