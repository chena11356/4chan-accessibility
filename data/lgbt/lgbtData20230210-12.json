Once you have decided you want to meet up with someone you should try to make plans to do that with them, going on for too long talking about whatever can feel like a waste of time if a guy doesn&#039;t think you will ever actually want to meet up.<br>Also if you dint know what he wants, just ask him. &quot;Are you looking for a friend or just to have some fun?&quot; Is a good question to ask. Questions in general are good most of the time. I think that the most important thing to learn to have a good relationship or sex or any interaction between two people is communicating well, and if you have a concern about the guy or with how he perceives anything you do, it&#039;s a good thing to think it through and figure out a way to actually talk to him openly and honestly about it, in a way that is neither self demeaning or aggrandazing or anything other than with the goal of empathetic problem solving if you are interested in pursuing things with him.<br>Most guys have very low emotional intelligence so if you can manage even some of that you will impress them.", "time": 1676032643, "resto": 29546457, "trip": "!xHg1XNS0QU"}, {"no": 29548586, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:39:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hello<br>i have posted here a few times before asking for your opinion on things<br>i&#039;m a tranny but feel a connection to gay guys in as much as i am a woman of twink experience<br>and also there&#039;s obvious overlaps in our sex lives and how we are viewed by others, sometimes<br>thoughts?", "time": 1676032768, "resto": 29546457}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29546618, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:10:38", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/passgen/ part 2", "com": "bump limit and such", "filename": "SmartSelect_20230209-231224_Gallery", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 689, "h": 687, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1676013038748627, "time": 1676013038, "md5": "tjOnpHdctPbfL2Hz58vivg==", "fsize": 251390, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "passgen-part-2", "replies": 230, "images": 44, "unique_ips": 54, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 29546625, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:11:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29546618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546618</a>", "filename": "EBDA56DB-2AB7-468F-891A-AF51827B0FEA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 825, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1676013115391632, "time": 1676013115, "md5": "ZvT9us0Y6y0ZPKqPubN4OA==", "fsize": 722801, "resto": 29546618}, {"no": 29546632, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:12:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29546625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546625</a><br>ily", "time": 1676013166, "resto": 29546618}, {"no": 29546633, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29546618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546618</a><br>Why did you upload my pic stop", "time": 1676013172, "resto": 29546618}, {"no": 29546634, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:12:55", "name": "sparky", "filename": "77", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3024, "h": 4009, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676013175173637, "time": 1676013175, "md5": "mAr46rhvba3dWtVVt2+3xQ==", "fsize": 823504, "resto": 29546618, "trip": "!!tw8RtxTVS5s"}, {"no": 29546637, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:13:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29546632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546632</a><br>idk who this is but thank u &lt;3 love u too :D", "time": 1676013211, "resto": 29546618}, {"no": 29546640, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:14:07", "name": "celly", "com": "the trick is to get in early, but not first<br>early also makes it so that you don&#039;t have to rate as many people (just kidding i&#039;ll circle back around. hold me to it.)<br><br><a href=\"#p29546625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546625</a><br>i am super jealous of your profile<br>also pass<br><a href=\"#p29546634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29546634</a><br>pass!

The best pivot would have been to go, the game is not made by jk and while she is still getting royalties, it&#039;s not her product in any way shape or form and even if it sells well it will be just a drop in the bucket to her fortune. And after getting the good will of people pivot to talking about the actual money maker and subsequent dogshit overpriced product that actually make jk her fortune, the books and merch, and actually move to a boycott of those and show alternatives to those products, cause trust me, there is plenty of actual good fan creations for HP that are far better than the merch. Because here is the thing, even if this boycott was successful it wouldn&#039;t really do shit, games are not the big money maker, if the game does poorly the studio gets shut down and that&#039;s that. If the merch is doing badly and it&#039;s because JK is still making money off it, that is when the big wigs actually take a step back and oust her from any future royalties and just buy her out.

Many people are far less patient however, and that is life, but you won&#039;t be a porcupine forever if you keep trying. Make people aware of your tsun moments. Learn to be more emotionally communicative and honest about your fears. It is a way that works if you find someone patient and of the right mindset. In other cases you will need to vary your approach, but in either case it will be a lot of catching yourself in the act and interrupting yourself.
