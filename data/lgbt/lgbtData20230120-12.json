It&#039;s by far the best AA you can get, even after orchidectomy or vaginoplasty. I know there&#039;s no strong studies to support that at the moment, but you can easily understand that, but suppressing all forms of testosterone effect (even the one produces by adrenal glands), it&#039;s obviously better than decapeptyl injections that only target testicules production. You can also see that the standard for prostatic hormonodependant cancer has better results in term of remission for orcidtectomy + bica than orchi alone. As for secondary effects, obviously you still need to be careful at the beginning of the treatment bc of potential liver injury (just keep in mind that a small raise on liver enzyme is normal and not to worry about), and review of medical studies like in hepatox doesn&#039;t really reveal direct causality between bica and real casesnof fullimant acute hepatitis (all patients always has another medication or environmental factor that is always easier to accuse, and dosage up to 300mg/d). So as for my personqal experiences, i empirically tested decapeptyl vs. Oestrogene monodose vs. Bicalutamide, and the differences are drastic. The 2 first groups (which, honestly, included only a dozen of patients) had cutaneous and persistent pilosity issues whereas the third just had perfect results on skin and pilosity. The only thing I would recommend is not to brutally stop the previous AA before changing to bica, bc it can take up to 5 weeks to be really effective, but after this period, there&#039;s no variations, it just works like a charm. I know it&#039;s not evidence based medicine, but i have a lot os testimony from people I know for sure that takes bica, that say the same.

Arguments against trans-inclusive policies often focus on cisgender women\u2019s safety from male violence, despite little evidence to suggest that such policies put cisgender women at risk. Across seven studies using U.S. and U.K. participants (N = 3,864), we investigate whether concerns about male violence versus attitudes toward trans people are a better predictor of support for trans-inclusive policies and whether these factors align with the reasons given by opponents and supporters regarding their policy views. We find that opponents of these policies do not accurately report their reasons for opposition: Specifically, while opponents claim that concerns about male violence are the primary reason driving their opposition, attitudes toward transgender people more strongly predicted policy views. These results highlight the limitations of focusing on overt discourse and emphasize the importance of investigating psychological mechanisms underlying policy support.</span><br>Conservatives routinely lie about their true motivations for the political positions they advocate for, such as lying that their primary concern in opposing trans women is safety when their true primary motivation is bigotry.", "filename": "Fj3RMiDX0AM7lxS", "ext": ".png", "w": 727, "h": 283, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 48, "tim": 1674194605445520, "time": 1674194605, "md5": "CeJm4jWApLnuqStWc1isEw==", "fsize": 8913, "resto": 29254600}, {"no": 29255597, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:04:01", "name": "Melanie", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255584</a><br><a href=\"#p29255585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255585</a><br>Wow you guys really brought out the coping non-sequitors after I proved that the majority of rapists in Sweden were Swedish.

The notion that trans women must be forced into sexual acts in order to uphold a false notion of &quot;revolutionary purity&quot; is a clear example of the bourgeois patriarchal oppression that we, as true socialist-feminists, must actively work to dismantle.Furthermore, the idea that one&#039;s worth as a revolutionary is determined by their sexual activity is a clear example of individualism, a concept antithetical to the collective, proletarian struggle. This type of thinking only serves to divide the working class and distract from the true enemy: the capitalist ruling class.Additionally, the Juche ideology of self-reliance and independence must be applied to the trans community. To force trans women into sexual acts against their will is a violation of their autonomy and agency. True socialist revolution must prioritize the liberation of all oppressed groups, including the trans community.In conclusion, the &quot;Tankie trannies need rape correction &quot; argument is not only morally reprehensible but also detrimental to the socialist revolutionary struggle. As true socialist-feminists and Juche-ists, we must reject this harmful and oppressive line of thinking and actively work towards the liberation of all oppressed groups, including the trans community, along Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism\u2013Prachanda Path-Babeuf-Berlinguer-Beauvoir-Bor<wbr>diga-Campanella-Castoriadis-Castro-<wbr>Debord--Engels-Gramsci-Guevara-Guzm<wbr>\u00e1n-HoHobsbawm-Hoxha-Kim-Kollontai--<wbr>Liebknecht-Luxemburgist-Marcos-Marc<wbr>use-More-Owen-Pankhurst-Pannekoek-P<wbr>asolin-iReclus-Reich---Sankara-Sart<wbr>re-Stalin-Th\u00e4lmann-Tito-Togliatti-T<wbr>rotskyist-Weitling-Zetkin-Basu-Chav<wbr>ismo Synthesis thought theory.", "filename": "img", "ext": ".png", "w": 653, "h": 784, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674197071678302, "time": 1674197071, "md5": "S6HStKQSKczOcSzSqs5eLQ==", "fsize": 25913, "resto": 29255844, "trip": "!!p7ldPiRE/6+"}, {"no": 29255966, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:46:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i&#039;m a tankie and while I haven&#039;t fucked a nazi tranner, I did fuck a self-proclaimed &quot;femboy fascist&quot;. he was very annoying but the political aspect to the sex was kinda fun, if extremely cringe.", "time": 1674197197, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29255973, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:47:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255906</a><br>Fascism is gemmy doe", "time": 1674197266, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29256000, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:49:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255949</a><br>i too, love overdosing on Adderall", "time": 1674197382, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29256006, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:50:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255949</a><br>blah blah blah shut up rocktra you&#039;re the first to get raped", "time": 1674197424, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29256014, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:50:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255949</a><br>high quality shitpost", "time": 1674197443, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29256021, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:52:19", "name": "sashhha", "com": "<a href=\"#p29255853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29255853</a><br>this was actually me after i accidentally bought like $200 worth of model kits bc i saw a single yt video when i was benzo\u2019d", "time": 1674197539, "resto": 29255844}, {"no": 29256422, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)02:46:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29256021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29256021</a><br>classic xanax tank model binge", "time": 1674200772, "resto": 29255844}]}]
