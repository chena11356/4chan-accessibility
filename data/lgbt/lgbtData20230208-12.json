The current study created a female-narrated version of the male-narrated casual game The Stanley Parable (TSP), and investigated player perceptions and behavioural responses to male versus female narrators. Participants (N=66) played TSP to reach a single ending and completed survey responses reflecting on their game experience. There were significant interactions between narrator and player gender, such that players tended to obey same-gendered narrators and to disobey opposite-gendered narrators at the first decision point in the game, controlling for prior familiarity with the game. There was a disparity between players\u2019 survey responses and their in-game decisions.

full ductal development and moderate lobuloalveolar development of the breasts from a histological standpoint.[132][133][134] The study also found that, in contrast, treatment of transgender women with estrogen and CPA (which is progestogenic in addition to antiandrogenic, unlike NSAAs) resulted in full lobuloalevolar development, as well as pregnancy-like breast hyperplasia in two of the subjects.[132][134] In addition, it was observed that the lobuloalveolar maturation reversed upon discontinuation of CPA after sex reassignment surgery in these individuals.[132] It was concluded that progestogen in addition to antiandrogen/estrogen treatment is required for the induction of full female histological breast development (i.e., that includes complete lobuloalveolar maturation), and that continued progestogen treatment is necessary to maintain such maturation.[132][133] It should be noted however that although these findings may have important implications in the contexts of lactation and breastfeeding, epithelial tissue accounts for approximately only 10% of breast volume (with the bulk of the breasts (80\u201390%) being represented by stromal or adipose tissue),[135][136][137][138] and it is uncertain to what extent, if any, that development of lobuloalveolar structures (a form of epithelial tissue) contributes to breast size and/or shape.[122]</span>", "time": 1675721873, "resto": 29481973}, {"no": 29496803, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)17:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com":

However, their extent of deviation away from cis women, is smaller than the extent of deviation that MtFs have from cis men. In other words, both FtMs and MtFs have intersex brains, but the extent of masculinisation of the FtM brain is still less than the extent of feminisation of the MtF brain. Speculatively though, it is easy to explain this, as there is nowadays almost-equal awareness of the possibility to transition either MtF or FtM, but significantly less social stigma against transitioning from F to M than from M to F.

This is a long way of saying, just because a trans woman was &#039;malebrained&#039; before transition doesn&#039;t mean she isn&#039;t trans, it only means she didn&#039;t get one of the possible sets of in utero feminization changes that some trans women get.

Appearance isn&#039;t relevant androphile/gynephile dichotomy now that there are youngshit agps. Homosexual men already have more feminized brains that heterosexual, it wouldn&#039;t make sense to then assume that the brain becomes even more feminized for gynephile mtfs but less feminized for androphile mtfs who likely were homosexual men earlier in life. You have to have a feminized hypothalamus for instance to have female-pattern brain activation to male pheromones, which gay men and some mtfs do have, but if you&#039;re a gynephile mtf it&#039;s likely you don&#039;t have that brain activation, and so likely have a less feminized brain. <br>The study in the op is a multivariate classifier of probability estimates, so it&#039;s probably not very specific, but if you look at the most sexually dimorphic areas of the brain like the INAH3, these areas again are feminized in gay males and mtfs, and these areas determine sexual behavior, partner preference, and courtship behavior, so it&#039;s most likely that in general androphile amabs have relatively feminine brains and because of this engage in feminine sexual roles, feminine courtship behavior, etc., while gynephile amabs maintain masculine roles in the same places. That&#039;s not to say that there aren&#039;t some gynephile trans women who do have significantly feminized brains, but you would be able to observe this difference easily, just as it&#039;s easy to observe gynephile mtfs who clearly have male courtship behavior and male sexual interests. But are the people at the very high end of brain masculinity in mtfs. When you get down to androphile mtfs you do sometimes see deranged weirdos like dylan mulvaney, but dylan isn&#039;t creepy in a masculine way, any of her masculinity is just appearance.

He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.

Some of the dogs received electrical shocks that they could not predict or control.<br><br>For this experiment, the dogs were placed in a box with two chambers divided by a low barrier. One chamber had an electrified floor and the other was not (Cherry, 2017).<br><br>When the researchers placed dogs in the box and turned on the electrified floor, they noticed a strange thing: Some dogs didn\u2019t even attempt to jump over the low barrier to the other side. Further, the dogs who didn\u2019t attempt to jump the barrier were generally the dogs who had previously been given shocks with no way to escape them, and the dogs who jumped the barrier tended to be those who had not received such treatment.<br><br>To further investigate this phenomenon, Seligman and Maier gathered a new batch of dogs and divided them into three groups:<br><br> Dogs in Group One were strapped into harnesses for a period of time and were not administered any shocks;<br> Dogs in Group Two were strapped into the same harnesses but were administered electrical shocks that they could avoid by pressing a panel with their noses;<br> Dogs in Group Three were placed in the same harnesses and also administered electrical shocks, but were given no way to avoid them.<br><br>Once these three groups had completed this first experimental manipulation, all dogs were placed (one at a time) in the box with two chambers. Dogs from Group One and Group Two were quick to figure out that they only needed to jump over the barrier to avoid the shocks, but most of the dogs from Group Three didn\u2019t even attempt to avoid them.<br><br>Based on their previous experience, these dogs concluded that there was nothing they could do to avoid being shocked", "filename": "\u0a48\ud83c\udf19\u2027\u250aNAZUNA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675844617614645, "time": 1675844617, "md5": "Prfbbahye1nwAKKVNafImg==", "fsize": 190488, "resto": 29516313, "trip": "!iloveyouaw"}, {"no": 29518647, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:23:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518628</a><br>Does this get your juices flowing Francesca", "filename": "IMG_20221206_222001457~2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4160, "h": 3120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675844631401129, "time": 1675844631, "md5": "xoUAq9xeaoIDQ+cPUVycHg==", "fsize": 2660360, "resto": 29516313}, {"no": 29518648, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:23:57", "name": "a deal with god", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518645</a>", "filename": "FmuZKm7XkAAYlHV", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 695, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1675844637513530, "time": 1675844637, "md5": "0DkKRo4wWkr5S6+pRo39eA==", "fsize": 76684, "resto": 29516313, "trip": "!!v2Sb8thfcZG"}, {"no": 29518653, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:24:32", "name": "a deal with god", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518647</a><br>meh<br>more of a risotto gal", "time": 1675844672, "resto": 29516313, "trip": "!!v2Sb8thfcZG"}, {"no": 29518657, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:24:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518645</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so some jews were torturing dogs by electrocuting them</span><br>why am not surprised baka", "time": 1675844692, "resto": 29516313}, {"no": 29518672, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:26:02", "name": "a deal with god", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518645</a><br>LMFAO its like you cant even fathom mental illness", "time": 1675844762, "resto": 29516313, "trip": "!!v2Sb8thfcZG"}, {"no": 29518674, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)03:26:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29518653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29518653</a><br>i like risotto but never made it, too filling.
