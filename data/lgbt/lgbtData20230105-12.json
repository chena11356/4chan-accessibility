Specifically, gay men who identify with a recep-tive (i.e., bottom) anal sex role (ASR) tend to report greater gender nonconformity than gay men preferring an insertive (i.e., top) ASR. Thus, while both subgroups have a same-sex sexual orientation, they vary in their gender expression. Examination of other traits affected by sexual differentia-tion/androgen signalling suggests that gay men delineated by ASR also differ in androgen exposure. For instance, gay men with a bottom ASR present with a more female-typical digit ratio than tops, while gay men with a top ASR have an earlier pubertal onset, are taller, and have more body hair than ASR bottoms. Recalled childhood separation anxiety (a psychologi-cal trait with consistent sex differences, females &gt; males) is also greater among gay men with a bottom than a top ASR</span><br><br>https://www.researchgate.net/public<wbr>ation/366092298_Using_Animal_Models<wbr>_to_Study_the_Interplay_Between_the<wbr>_Biodevelopmental_Pathways_Underlyi<wbr>ng_Human_Sexual_Orientation", "filename": "1670692008211757", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 511, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1672909821988381, "time": 1672909821, "md5": "lBYj77vPNGCCqq9XEKv7YQ==", "fsize": 38189, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "are-tops-superior-to-bottoms", "replies": 53, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 29052579, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:30:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29052441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29052441</a><br>this post was suprisingly hot", "time": 1672911013, "resto": 29052441}, {"no": 29052587, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:31:05", "name": "Fsn", "com": "Tops are physically superior but they&#039;re dumb so bottoms win", "time": 1672911065, "resto": 29052441}, {"no": 29052596, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:32:21", "name": "jelly", "com": "tfw no high t alpha chad bf", "time": 1672911141, "resto": 29052441}, {"no": 29052603, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:32:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29052441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29052441</a><br>We&#039;re taller, stronger, smarter, more mentally stable, more successful in life and are dominant, of course tops are superior to bottoms, your common bottom works at a grocery store and couldn&#039;t think of anything other than being plowed and how they hate the people they work with whereas us tops are working 1% tech jobs etc, we are superior in every way but we also make sure our bottoms are loved and cared for", "time": 1672911176, "resto": 29052441}, {"no": 29052617, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)04:34:31", "name": "Fsn", "com": "<a href=\"#p29052603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29052603</a><br>That&#039;s not true tops are not that smart there just strong.

Largely to better my understanding.<br><br>I&#039;m an odd mixture of sadistic but also guilt-prone. I like hurting people but I hate knowing that they&#039;re hurt afterwards if that makes sense? Generally the latter is much much stronger than the former. I&#039;ve learnt to suspend my guilt a little because people in the past have used it to hurt and control me. <br><br>I guess I would like to deal with people in different terms than appetite and guilt because those can be easily manipulated, and posting here is part of my exploration of that. <br><br>I would probably never go through with what OP has done. I&#039;d do this as a consensual fantasy but not behind the back of a genuinely loving bf. As much as I might sometimes like to I&#039;m not interested in the mental gymnastics of justifying it. If he found out it would probably really hurt him. And I&#039;ve heard of people not getting over being cheated on for decades. That&#039;s a serious degree of hurt for a little bit of fun, it just doesn&#039;t make sense. <br>Being evil is fun but not sustainable and I don&#039;t think mentally well people go through with it except out of desperation. <br><br>I think OP is an interesting person tho.", "time": 1672898797, "resto": 29033605}, {"no": 29050957, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)01:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29050901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29050901</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think OP is an interesting person tho.</span><br>Thank you", "time": 1672899228, "resto": 29033605}, {"no": 29050992, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)01:17:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29033605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29033605</a><br>Hey OP, I was in a relationship for 10 years.
