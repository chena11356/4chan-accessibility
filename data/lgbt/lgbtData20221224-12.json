These patterns were also suggested by whole brain analyses, with homosexual women showing category-specific activations of greater extents in visual and auditory processing areas.

The second one thought the rustling was a tiger and he ran like hell, but it was only the wind and his friends all laughed at him for being such a chickenshit. But the third guy thought it was only the wind, so he shrugged it off and the tiger had him for dinner. And the same thing happened a million times across ten thousand generations - and after a while everyone was seeing tigers in the grass even when there were`t any tigers, because even chickenshits have more kids than corpses do.

They have even been reported as having &quot;voluptuous breasts&quot; (Roy Hertz et al., 1966; Valentine, 1969; Polani, 1970). John McLean Morris, the gynecologist who reviewed and summarized all of the existing scientific literature on CAIS women in 1953 (including 82 cases) and gave their condition the (now-obsolete) name &quot;testicular feminization&quot;, described their breasts as &quot;unusually large&quot; and &quot;jumbo-sized&quot; (Morris, 1953; Quigley et al., 1995). He additionally said in his famous 1953 review that they had &quot;normal female breasts, often with a tendency to be overdeveloped&quot; (Morris, 1953). In actuality however, some CAIS women have large breasts while some have small breasts (Wisniewski et al., 2000), and we have no clear data that their breasts are in fact larger on average. The variation in breast growth in CAIS women parallels the same large variation in breast size between individuals that&#039;s seen in women in general.</span>", "time": 1671823185, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28875991, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:20:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28875984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28875984</a><br>why post the rare case of CAIS in here unprompted lol", "time": 1671823234, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28875996, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:21:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28875882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28875882</a><br>in that case 6mg a day would be fine<br><a href=\"#p28875908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28875908</a><br>mainly booba development will stop at about tanner 3 takes about 6 months to a year", "time": 1671823280, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28876309, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:50:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i take 4mg e sublingually, like 1mg, 1mg, 2mg, spaced 6 hours apart. my e 11 hours after the 2mg dose was 213pmol/L (58 pg/ml). my problem is that idk what 6 hours after 1mg looks like, it might be wrong to up my dose because of this? i dont know when ill be able to get another blood test", "time": 1671825032, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28876342, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)14:54:00", "name": "Slava Marlow", "com": "<a href=\"#p28876309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28876309</a><br>I think it&#039;s fine.

Some people regain all their hair, some regain none. If it&#039;s been ten years, though, I think you may be out of luck. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s common to regain more than a year or two worth of hair loss. HRT may not stop your hair loss at all, just look at the boomer trannies and IT&#039;S MA&#039;AMs who started late in life and probably had pretty high test before, the damage is already done. FtMs who detransition naturally produce E and they don&#039;t regain their lost hair either. Definitely a case of you want to start as early as possible.<br><br>If hair is all you care about though, you don&#039;t need E, and it probably shouldn&#039;t be anywhere near the top of the list of options. E inhibits hair loss as a side effect, the actual thing that stops hair loss is low testosterone. Higher E levels will dampen your T, that&#039;s how monotherapy works, but E will have other effects, including breasts, which is going to be a problem if you want to present as conventionally masculine. No, it&#039;s not as simple as &quot;I&#039;ll just bind if they get too big&quot;, you&#039;ll also get a different weight distribution and skin oils, people will notice, and binding isn&#039;t comfortably even with a smaller chest. <br><br>I suggest you do what the rich people do, get a hair transplant and take an antiandrogen. You can do the transplant in Thailand or Turkey or somewhere to save money on that (but it&#039;s still quite expensive, save up), and buy Chinese fina or Brazilian antiandrogen pills to selfmedicate. You don&#039;t have to be Elon to afford it. And yeah, Elon and the other rich people fighting hair loss are definitely messing with their hormones, just look closely at the pictures and you&#039;ll recognise elements they have in common with transitioning.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy.

It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH</span>", "time": 1671844491, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28880801, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:15:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28880465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28880465</a><br>Yeah, once i puncture it once and another when i flipped it over<br>Also, is otokonokopharma still alive?

I think there are also cases where hondosed mtfs get really big breasts on low doses of oral E, but little progress in anything else. <br>A lot of this comes from dr. powers, who is an advocate for the idea that estrone is important for early breast growth, and that estrone should be the dominant hormone until tanner 3. <br>But as you can see from that study, there isn&#039;t a lot of actual evidence to support it. <br>I think the best way to go about it is probably just to transition normally as well as you can, and then after a year or two when you&#039;re on monotherapy, if your breast growth isn&#039;t satisfactory you can always add 1mg oral E or something, which apparently has been effective in other people.

I&#039;m really considering transition and it&#039;s like the only thing in life I&#039;m looking forward to right now, but it&#039;s so hard to get over the fear to start it. Even though I have a better self-image and outlook right now, I sometimes really get into a funk where I think I look really masculine and I could never pass and I can&#039;t see myself as a woman at all and I get really depressed and suicidal feeling totally hopeless, but it doesn&#039;t last.<br>I think I know what I need to do, too.

I think maybe I could at least mostly pass, especially with FFS, but there&#039;s still that doubt and fear, what if I don&#039;t pass? It&#039;s such a hard decision to make because like I&#039;m trying to predict the future and on top of that sometimes the feelings get less intense and the option feels less like it&#039;s immediately necessary and it makes me second guess myself, and also it feels like it drives me insane enough to kind of cloud my thoughts", "time": 1671862491, "resto": 28856148}, {"no": 28884032, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:17:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So...have any of you become more masculine than your father yet?", "time": 1671862636, "resto": 28856148}, {"no": 28884060, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28884032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28884032</a><br>I&#039;ve been taller than him for a while now<br>can&#039;t really match his level of damage though as he has worked construction out in the scorching heat but even then he has aged gracefully I&#039;d say<br>I still masculinized fast as fuck but at least the worst of it has passed<br><br><a href=\"#p28884014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28884014</a><br>idk giving it an honest shot with hrt helped me out a lot and made me realize I just don&#039;t want the social aspects of transition at all<br>at most I&#039;d consider manmoding on hrt and it ends there, I like my dick tho so it isn&#039;t worth it", "time": 1671862824, "resto": 28856148}, {"no": 28884148, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:31:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28884032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28884032</a><br>No, not really at all.

Everyone goes around sucking eachother off for how &quot;nice&quot; they&#039;re being, because they give like, ONE sandwich to the homeless or whatever, and pretend like they&#039;re all fucking Gandhi. It&#039;s not just that they&#039;re all moralizing pricks about it, its over the most basic shit. Not to mention, this is shit we SHOULD be doing all year anyway. We shouldn&#039;t need a fucking fake corporate holiday to come around in order to treat the homeless, sick, and such like human beings. But no, i&#039;m supposed to be &quot;proud&quot; because middle-class jerkoffs go around giving thank you cards and a sandwich to one poor guy a year. And i&#039;m supposed to act like they fucking saved Iran or something.<br>not to mention, christmas fans are by FAR the most infuriating. The fucking gall. If you don&#039;t ORGASM at the idea of christmas, these motherfuckers act like you killed a puppy and give you shit constantly. There are people like that for ALL holidays, but BY FAR the most for christmas.

People decorate their houses for halloween, but the difference is its not BLINDING walking past a house decorated for halloween.<br>Even &quot;normal&quot; fans of it act like YOURE fucking weird for being upset at christmas shit being sold from august to february.

Even if the pursuit were in the other direction, with the younger person actively trying to date the older trans woman, I\u2019d still be leery of it due to all the groomer rhetoric and honestly I feel like people are more sensitive to age gaps now than they used to be. I admit that I dated people, mostly men, in their 30s back when I was in my teens and early 20s, but on the other side of it now idk if I could see myself being the older person in a relationship or

I guess it&#039;s a letdown either way, they either get a dissociated and miserable son or they lose their only son and get a daughter that hopefully feels a lot more alive and happy instead. Personally I&#039;d rather my kid just be happy. I already told them that I&#039;m really not planning on kids so I already broke that news, but at least I&#039;ll bank sperm in case I change my mind down the line. Maybe the idea of being a mom will be more appealing to me than the idea of being a dad, and I&#039;ve heard that prog can make you a little baby crazy.", "time": 1671866233, "resto": 28883940}, {"no": 28884539, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:20:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28883940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28883940</a><br>I probably would end up fucking my tranny son, so he can stay at home, even if I won&#039;t see as my kid anymore.
