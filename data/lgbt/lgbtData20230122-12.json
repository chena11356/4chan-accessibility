Sure, some people say it\u2019s easy, but I just don\u2019t get it. I guess I\u2019m just not good at making friends in general. I mean, I\u2019ve tried joining all sorts of groups and forums, but nothing seems to work out. It\u2019s like everyone already knows each other, and I\u2019m just the odd one out.Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not outgoing enough. I mean, I\u2019m sure some people are naturally good at making friends online, but I\u2019m not one of them. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in my own world, and no one else can get in. I want to reach out and make connections, but I just don\u2019t know how.But, then again, maybe if I could make a few friends online, it would be worth the risk. What if I could actually talk to someone who understood me? Someone who could be my friend? That would be amazing.But then again, I don\u2019t even know how to start. Do I just jump in and start talking? Or do I wait for someone to talk to me? I guess I could just try posting something on my profile and see if anyone responds.But then again, what if I post something and no one responds? That would be so embarrassing. What if they all thought I was a loser? That would be even worse.But then again, maybe I should just take a chance and try to make some friends online. I mean, it\u2019s not like I can just go out and make friends like normal people do. And I\u2019m sure there are some people out there who would understand me and be willing to be my friend.But then again, I don\u2019t know what to say. Do I just talk about myself or do I ask questions? What if I ask too many questions and come off as desperate? That would be so strange.I don\u2019t know.

Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer.[28] Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of AIDS victims</span><br>you&#039;re literally just a retard idk what else you want", "time": 1674386994, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283543, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:33:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283534</a><br>Wow you have aids too Not surprising for a drugged out promiscuous ho", "time": 1674387183, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283548, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:34:47", "name": "emo", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283534</a><br>https://voca.ro/1eh7RTTMfSU8", "time": 1674387287, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283554, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:35:33", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283543</a><br>i really dont know what kind of response i expected like you&#039;re a retard you&#039;re never gonna have an epiphany were you realize you&#039;re a literal mental midget im just wasting my breath talking to a moron", "time": 1674387333, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283570, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283554</a><br>https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/p<wbr>ress-releases/lower-childhood-iq-as<wbr>sociated-with-higher-risk-of-adult-<wbr>mental-disorders/<br><br>Damn according to Harvard you are low IQ", "time": 1674387447, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283571, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:37:42", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283548</a><br>https://voca.ro/1kGqbMlPu0uZ", "time": 1674387462, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283573, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:38:27", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283570</a><br>I think it&#039;s funny that you&#039;re so stupid you think being fallacious is somehow a win", "time": 1674387507, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283579, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:42:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283573</a><br>Can you define fallacious without googling it", "time": 1674387720, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283595, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:44:47", "name": "emo", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283571</a><br>https://voca.ro/12AeEePRkTnQ", "time": 1674387887, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283596, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:44:49", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283579</a><br>arguing from a mistaken belief <br>you do it because you lack critical understanding psychological because you&#039;re an anti intellectual who litterally cannot stop making fallacious arguments because you&#039;re an invincibly ignorant dipshit", "time": 1674387889, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283602, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:45:48", "name": "emo", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283579</a><br>fallacious is like a blowjob but a real old timey way of saying suck dick.", "time": 1674387948, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283612, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:48:49", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283595</a><br>https://voca.ro/1j5gE7xsy5xy", "time": 1674388129, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283616, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:49:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283596</a><br>Pee pee poo poo<br><a href=\"#p29283602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283602</a><br>Based", "time": 1674388195, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283619, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:51:15", "name": "You&#039;ll eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283616</a><br>https://files.catbox.moe/w7fb1u.mp4<wbr>", "time": 1674388275, "resto": 29281014}, {"no": 29283623, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)06:51:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29283596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29283596</a><br>You are a bigot and you push white supremacist rhetoric.

Let me offer a different approach: try building up to a more lengthy study period by first establishing shorter study times. These could be very short study times, mind you. You might start with just studying for 10 or 15 minutes in the evenings, then work up slowly from there. The next evening might be 17 minutes, then 20, then 25, and so on. The idea is to make this goal achievable and repeatable so that it can become a fixture of your routine.

Spare T metabolises into E2, and E2 shuts down your T production. What will happen is you get a week or two of high T, which fades into slightly high T and elevated E, which then fades back to your normal T levels as your body stabilises around the steroids you&#039;re taking. You&#039;d basically have to ramp up and replace your natural production entirely with supplemental T, and then you&#039;re still going to end up with elevated E (which is why steroid users grow boobs).<br><br>Your natural T production isn&#039;t determined by how much T there is in your blood, they&#039;re determined by how much E2 there is in your blood. Leftover T turns into E2. If you have a naturally low T level, that means your androgen receptors just aren&#039;t using more T than that, because enough T is left over to tell your testicles to ramp down. Barring things like damage to the testicles or hypothyroidism I don&#039;t know anything about, your blood will probably have as much T as your body needs.<br><br>I recommend you not play with steroids, and just get your body in shape with discipline and hard work. A good exercise regime will not only stabilise your circadian rhythm, making it easier to sleep properly, but it will also increase your body&#039;s androgen receptiveness, boosting how much T you can make use of, and thus also boosting how much T your body will produce.

Thus, passing may serve as a form of self-preservation or self-protection in instances where expressing one&#039;s true or prior identity may be dangerous.[4][5] Passing may require acceptance into a community and may also lead to temporary or permanent leave from another community to which an individual previously belonged. Thus, passing can result in separation from one&#039;s original self, family, friends, or previous living experiences.[6] While successful passing may contribute to economic security, safety, and avoidance of stigma, it may take an emotional toll as a result of denial of one&#039;s previous identity and may lead to depression or self-loathing.[4] When an individual deliberately attempts to &#039;pass&#039; as a member of an identity group, they may actively engage in performance of behaviors they believe to be associated with membership of that group. Passing practices can also include information management where the passer attempts to control or conceal any stigmatizing information that may reveal disparity from their presumed identity.[7]<br><br>Etymologically, the term is simply the nominalisation of the verb pass in its phrasal use with for or as, as in a counterfeit passing for the genuine article or an impostor passing as another person.

Impure product (mdma cut with amphetamines or piperazines are typically the biggest culprit). It&#039;s pretty obvious you&#039;ve had stuff that&#039;s been cut if it&#039;s hard to go to sleep after or the high lasts more than 4 or 5 hours after your last dose (molly&#039;s timeframe is super consistent). Always test your drugs kids<br>2. You do it way too often (give yourself at least a month between rolls) or you do way too much in a night continually trying to keep the high going into the next day. Often times people that do too much also don&#039;t care where their stuff comes from so they&#039;re not getting pure stuff and the problems compound<br>3. You don&#039;t take care of yourself before, during, or after the trip. Eat well on the day of, fruits and veggies and healthy carbs, don&#039;t eat too much meat esp red meats in the few hours before. Drink tons of water during and after and avoid things like alcohol.

It won&#039;t stay super weak and untrained anyway, you&#039;ll gain some upper body strength while hauling weights.", "time": 1674302514, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270539, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270526</a><br>you&#039;re brainwormed, lifting a little won&#039;t turn them into a bodybuilder", "time": 1674302673, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270563, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:07:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270539</a><br>you don&#039;t know shit", "time": 1674302875, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270576, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:10:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270526</a><br>Are you one of those retards who think you&#039;ll immadiately become a massive bodybuilder the moment you touch something heavy?", "time": 1674303004, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270594, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:12:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270576</a><br>of course she is", "time": 1674303142, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270599, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270563</a><br>Clearly you don\u2019t either considering my shoulders and hips are virtually the same width.", "time": 1674303158, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270600, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:12:45", "name": "crowbar enjoyer", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270069</a><br>because I can\u2019t gain weight or muscle, never really could, and as good a look it would be I\u2019d rather be weak and frail and be dating a muscle mommy than be one myself", "time": 1674303165, "resto": 29270069, "trip": "!!olu1yK3mrur"}, {"no": 29270613, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:14:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270599</a><br>Nta but sounds based can you post a pic?", "time": 1674303249, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270619, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:14:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270526</a><br>Also, this is a great way to wind up with an incredibly fucked up and imbalanced body.", "time": 1674303274, "resto": 29270069}, {"no": 29270640, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:19:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29270539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29270539</a><br>Bitch, I&#039;m not saying not to lift altogether, I&#039;m saying to lift in a way that will help you to compensate for what&#039;s lacking and without adding to what&#039;s already big as is.

That can cause excessive brightness and nasality in the sound.<br><br>2) I&#039;ve seen that some voice training guides use eeeeeee or &quot;ehhhhh&quot; unvoiced to teach you to shrink your resonant space, but I think that shape has a lot of horizontal spread and can make you super bright, I think taking an &#039;uuuuhhhhhhh&quot; mouth shape up gives you a similar decrease in resonant space in the vocal tract while still allowing you to have a rounder sound.
