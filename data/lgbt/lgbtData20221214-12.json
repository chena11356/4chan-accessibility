And they have very different physical symptoms.<br>Texanon claims to not know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is legitimately preposterous.<br>We know that Tex has intersex genitalia, meaning that he has a &#039;severe&#039; (for lack of a better word) form of intersexuality. This contrasts with some chromosomal forms of intersexuality which have little to no effect on a person&#039;s body, and can go undiscovered for life. Doctors would have noticed Tex&#039;s genitalia while he was in the womb. With Tex&#039;s parents&#039; permission, doctors would have been able to determine exactly what kind of intersexuality Tex had - if not before birth, then soon after. It is highly likely that Tex&#039;s parents would have given permission for these tests because it is medically important information. Different kinds of intersexuality have a profound effect on the body&#039;s interaction with certain medications, risks of medical conditions, cancers, etc. It is vital for a parent to know these things.<br>But okay. Maybe Tex&#039;s parents didn&#039;t get these tests done, or they did, but they never told Tex the results, leaving him unsure. It doesn&#039;t matter, because Tex has been hospitalised multiple times in his life, including as an independent adult. If Texanon couldn&#039;t tell the doctors what kind of intersexuality he has, they would have tested him immediately upon entry and told him the results. Again, this is vital medical information, like doing a blood test, there&#039;s no way to get around it.<br>(1/2)", "filename": "1601334410505", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 283, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1671014717243378, "time": 1671014717, "md5": "w1nSR8skX9wIXi9OJa2h8g==", "fsize": 27689, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751402, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751358</a><br>is that what you and debaser call the fat hairy pooner cunt you eat", "time": 1671014741, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751406, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:46:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751397</a><br>(2/2)<br>Consider also that Tex takes medication, and that prescriptions vary for different sexes.

Can you imagine having a condition as major as intersexuality - one which places you apart from 99% of society - and not taking any steps to understand your situation? Living in ignorance about the workings of your own body? Knowing that you are neither male nor female, but not taking any steps to figure out what you are instead? It is ridiculous.<br>There&#039;s no way Texanon is intersex. I would bet money on it.<br>And I think the most interesting question here is: why is he lying? By labelling himself as intersex, Tex has attracted a lot of aggression and ridicule from /gaygen/. Why would someone willingly bring that upon themselves, especially someone like Tex who is so conflict-averse? We know that Texanon has issues with sex - is claiming to be intersex a way of desexualising himself in the gay community? Maybe Texanon is transgender or non-binary and pretending to be intersex gives them gender euphoria. I don&#039;t know. I am interested in your thoughts on the matter.", "time": 1671014778, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751432, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:50:14", "name": "ConservativeBottom", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751397</a><br><a href=\"#p28751406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751406</a><br>please be nice to tex.", "time": 1671015014, "resto": 28748475, "trip": "!fJGCk.nHz2"}, {"no": 28751435, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:50:25", "name": "horror", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751365</a><br>ok well sounds like we cant be friends<br><br><a href=\"#p28751367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751367</a><br>thats only ok on sandwiches", "time": 1671015025, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751443, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "texas", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 677, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671015086507029, "time": 1671015086, "md5": "Dz3o//YGdHEQ2B6CKI7PUA==", "fsize": 50738, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751446, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:51:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751372</a><br>no only afro-brazilian music is good", "time": 1671015107, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751450, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:52:22", "name": "horror", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751443</a><br>my impact", "time": 1671015142, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751456, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:53:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751374</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;punches your head</span>", "time": 1671015190, "resto": 28748475}, {"no": 28751464, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:54:04", "name": "ConservativeBottom", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;afro-brazilian music</span><br>i didn&#039;t know you can hear race in music", "time": 1671015244, "resto": 28748475, "trip": "!fJGCk.nHz2"}, {"no": 28751467, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)05:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28751432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28751432</a><br>Oh shush.

Only simple yes/no consent predicts whether participants will respond positively. Sex is simple and enjoyable and doesn&#039;t require a great amount of skill or intellect to engage in, and children freely engage in sexual activity with their peers and with adults in cultures where it is not prohibited:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Murphy and Quain reported that &quot;there was no heterosexual activity between children, for there were no girls of appropriate age in the village. Thus, pre-pubescent sexual relations occurred between boys or between boys and men, and almost always it was the boys who were the instigators. [...] The minor homosexual engagements that took place between the boys themselves were [...] in the nature of play&quot;, while no adult homosexuality was seen. &quot;The sexual play of a young child might even include his father&quot;; at least, one is reported to manipulate a boy in erection, without much consideration for observers. Trumai (Central Brazil)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Relations between men and women and boys and girls, whether married or not, are always cordial and often marked by light to heavy flirting. Sexually it is the same. So long as children are not forced or hurt, there is no prohibition against their participating in sex with adults. I remember once talking to Xisaoxoi, a Piraha man in his late thirties, when a nine or ten year old girl was standing beside him. As we talked, she rubbed her hands sensually over his chest and back and rubbed his crotch area through his thin, worn nylon shorts. Both were enjoying themselves. &quot;What&#039;s she doing?&quot; I asked superfluously. &quot;Oh, she&#039;s just playing. We play together. When she&#039;s big she will be my wife&quot; was his nonchalant reply - and, indeed, after the girl went though puberty, they were married.&quot;</span>", "filename": "800px-Boy", "ext": ".png", "w":

B/X is a much more elegant game than 5e. Combat is over in 1-3 rounds and doesn&#039;t have inflated HP totals. The XP system rewards treasure hunting over combat, which synchronizes with the core dungeon crawling gameplay loop instead of wandering through a line of railroaded DM plot points. The game only has 4 human classes and 3 nonhuman races, which is all you need for classic fantasy - a city full of mushroom people isn&#039;t so mystical in 5e when you have warforged astral self monks and psionic tiefing knights at home. That, and you don&#039;t have to make charisma rolls for intimidation or persuasion which means you won&#039;t be foiled by the d20 after actually doing good roleplaying. <br><br>5e doesn&#039;t use 3d6 down the line because you need to roll skill checks for absolutely everything.

Offering state-assisted suicide to people with depression creates a negative incentive for there to be some sort of &quot;end&quot; to studying therapeutic treatment of mental illnesses. Treatment of mental illness is complicated, but I, like most people probably, do not think that suicide is the answer for most of them. Treatment for mental illness often kind of sucks, but people are learning and trying to improve the practice constantly, ranging from new therapy approaches to new medicine to finding out old medicines might not work as well as we thought. I feel like state-sanctioned suicide would reduce growth in these areas.<br><br>2. I personally struggled with depression for instance for much of my teenage and early adult life, but I do not feel that way any longer. I think that were it just an option to die, I and many other people would have likely died before having a chance to experience better things in life. <br><br>3. I think what governments choose to support is not just something to consider from a perspective of legality but from what the goals of the society it represents are. It seems like nothing this represents is really a good thing. It feels like this is the government saying it has given up on improving the conditions of its people or that the medical and academic institutions it has funded will just not find a way to meaningfully help. <br><br>4. I think it enables a bad mindset for the mentally unwell and will also lead to people dying who are not unwell enough that they cannot recover. I remember some old forum that described &quot;living with suicide&quot; that I strongly related to where people would constantly fantasize about esoteric or detailed plans to commit suicide. I believe that, with legal assisted suicide, people would instead plan for that, and in many cases if gatekeeping is lax enough, go through with it when they are not really that sick. <br><br>post too long continuing in another, also didn&#039;t proof read this lol", "time": 1671007627, "resto": 28749961}, {"no": 28750618, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)03:50:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28750564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28750564</a><br>ok fine you are the specialist snowflake to have ever existed <br><br>why don&#039;t you grace the earth with your continued presence then? you could be a gem amongst all this rubble", "time": 1671007811, "resto": 28749961}, {"no": 28750619, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)03:50:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28750507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28750507</a><br>there&#039;s no such thing as &#039;not having the courage to kill yourself&#039; that just means you aren&#039;t actually suicidal you&#039;re just looking for an escape like literally every fucking one else.

I think that for people with suicidal ideation the idea of an easy out like assisted suicide reduce any incentive they might have to get better and instead just kill themselves. Like if you&#039;re depressed but not that mentally ill, at some point you have to grapple with the reality that you either need to get a gun, stick it into your face, and blow off your entire fucking head... or try to unfuck your brain somehow. And if the out is nice, pretty, and requires no actual strong action on your own part, many depressed people I think may go that route. Depression often exists with a lack of motivation to do anything, including the suicide they think they might want, and suicide generally happens not through detailed planning they go through but rather an extreme burst of emotions, but an assisted suicide route for death creates a path that requires little extreme input by themselves. <br><br>In other words, I think it encourages depressed people to stay depressed, would justify the depressive mindset to them, and would create many more suicides for people who would likely reach a point where they learn to manage with their mental illness were they just to live another 5 years. <br><a href=\"#p28750623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28750623</a><br>Firstly, I do not think this is really the case.

But lesbians since our kinda sex hardly counts as real sex we skip so much of the risk.

Its not that gay men are more likely to have STDs cause theyre more deviant and less promiscuous. Its more that anal sex in itself increases chances compared to vaginal sex (due to risk of anal tearing and anal walls not having as much immune defense like vagina do) and combined with the fact that most gays saw condoms as a hetbreeder thing. So gay dudes have more anal sex than hets. Thats all.

When we first met on a video game we were around the same age but very young (10 and 11 i think) and also cringe ben shipero types. Later she lost her edge and while i also changed my views i still used 4chan etc which is why this post hurts so much; Especially because a year or maybe two ago i ended up confessing to liking her and came out as trans to her. We ended up dating and she came out to me as trans too After edating for like a few months we stated to get distant for some reason and i found out she was dating someone else. After this we truly stopped dating and just stayed friends. I really care about her and have moved on but despite reconnecting for a bit we have drifted apart again (she has a lot of school work and lives at a boarding school most of the time so it makes talking hard). I really wish we could start talking again i miss talking to her and having all-nighters paying with each other.<br>;-;", "filename": "Trace by KDK", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670998662772979, "time": 1670998662, "md5": "KZmVZetdmG747tv+9zJe3g==", "fsize": 926938, "resto": 28747250}, {"no": 28749905, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:28:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28748608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28748608</a><br>iwn", "time": 1671002918, "resto": 28747250}, {"no": 28750048, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)02:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I had an old tranny friend and wanna bore her chest with my rammy", "time": 1671003855, "resto": 28747250}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28746694, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:40:46", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Why couldn&#039;t this happen to me?", "com": "I was born a male but I&#039;ve always felt jealous of characters thats gender got swapped... <br><br>As I kid I used to wish it would happen to me so bad I used to pray every night that I&#039;d become a girl.<br><br>It never happened and now I read gender bender mangas like pic rel feeling sad for something that&#039;ll never happen.. it&#039;s just not fair", "filename": "3c6d7e53c2e422d8414f961d564ab7289b8427ddr1-800-815v2_uhq (2)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 815, "tn_w": 245, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670985646547860, "time": 1670985646, "md5": "/CArHkqzGklLAzJ+vB+03Q==", "fsize": 95744, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-couldnt-this-happen-to-me", "replies": 27, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 28746712, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)21:42:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28746694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28746694</a><br>;-; iktf.
