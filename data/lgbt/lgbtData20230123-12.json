When the inner critic tells you that you are not worthy or that you\u2019re not loved, remember that that voice does not belong to you\u2014that it does not possess any control over you.

If you have a loving family and partner, you\u2019re already leagues ahead of others. Never forget your strengths and innate value. You have worth.

You could do a string of beads through and then connect it to itself for infinite beads in whichever direction.

Often times I end up needing to do a follicle more than once or giving it more than 20,000 microCoulombs in order for it to slide out without resistance. The skin ends up looking red and irritated for a few days but using a moisturizing cream with antimicrobial properties helps a lot. Find one that uses natural ingredients so it&#039;s easier on the skin. The one I use is shea butter based with a blend of essential oils (inb4 eSsEnTiAl oIlS blah bla. Yeah, yeah, they don&#039;t cure cancer but they are good for cuts, scrapes, and scar prevention)<br><br>The hairs do go away permanently but those dormant follicles are a bitch. I&#039;ll do a session, be hair free for a while, then different ones pop up. It takes hours to do a small section and you need to let the hairs grow out long enough to grip with tweezers so it&#039;s hard to schedule it with work and stuff. I usually do it on 3 day weekends or when I know I won&#039;t be leaving the house for a couple days and spend a whole day doing as much as I can. It gets tiring more than it hurts. I know it bothers my bf when I have stubble, so that&#039;s another hurdle in setting up for it. That being said, they are coming back slower and more sparsely but I&#039;m also kinda lazy about doing it. If you&#039;re adamant about it you could get rid of them faster. Word of advice get the Ballet F4 needles. These will actually go all the way down to the root. I got the F3 and they&#039;re a little thinner than I would like but meh it&#039;s not the end of the world. <br><br><a href=\"#p29286934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29286934</a><br>That might have been me.

Spare T metabolises into E2, and E2 shuts down your T production. What will happen is you get a week or two of high T, which fades into slightly high T and elevated E, which then fades back to your normal T levels as your body stabilises around the steroids you&#039;re taking. You&#039;d basically have to ramp up and replace your natural production entirely with supplemental T, and then you&#039;re still going to end up with elevated E (which is why steroid users grow boobs).<br><br>Your natural T production isn&#039;t determined by how much T there is in your blood, they&#039;re determined by how much E2 there is in your blood. Leftover T turns into E2. If you have a naturally low T level, that means your androgen receptors just aren&#039;t using more T than that, because enough T is left over to tell your testicles to ramp down. Barring things like damage to the testicles or hypothyroidism I don&#039;t know anything about, your blood will probably have as much T as your body needs.<br><br>I recommend you not play with steroids, and just get your body in shape with discipline and hard work. A good exercise regime will not only stabilise your circadian rhythm, making it easier to sleep properly, but it will also increase your body&#039;s androgen receptiveness, boosting how much T you can make use of, and thus also boosting how much T your body will produce. It&#039;ll also produce a lot of serotonin, which is basically a &quot;feel good&quot; hormone.", "time": 1674333345, "resto": 29269925}, {"no": 29275380, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:51:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Howdy.

If you want to get a normal gf who just happens to be older it\u2019s going to be just as difficult as socializing with ppl except on hard mode since you\u2019re basically trying to impress someone to the point that she\u2019ll let you touch her intimately.

People who get SRS without AGP often regret surgery, people with AGP have stronger sexual satisfaction after SRS than those without AGP. Additionally, AGP who do not have SRS, still have stronger sexual satisfaction and experience more arousal during both masturbation and intercourse than those without AGP.<br><br>3.

AGP will save civilization: AGP will reduce the rate of reproduction, saving humanity from overpopulation, global warming, and disaster.<br><br>6.

This will reduce the amount of incels and social unrest, leading to a safer society with less mass shootings.<br><br>7. AGP will result in world peace: Men always fight and wage war with each other.

One also needs additional effort laser/electrolysis for any facial and chest hair, voice training, and even FFS in some cases. Other details like plucking eyebrows and feminine mannerisms, such as the way one walks and dresses can also make a major difference. Also of note is that orchiectomy can help suppress testosterone better than AAs can. Having testosterone levels below 30 ng/dL is essential. Many doctors only aim for under 50 ng/dL, which is just hondosing. Any level above average is potentially suboptimal and could potentially lead to slowed feminization or continuing masculinization in trans woman, and that&#039;s an unacceptable risk. Even word choice can affect perceived gender. Self-confidence also goes a long way.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they&#039;re not just sad- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lana Del Rey truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#039;t appreciate, for instance, the depth in Lana&#039;s existential catchphrase &quot;My pussy tastes like Pepsi-Cola,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev&#039;s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
