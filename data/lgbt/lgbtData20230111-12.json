The same goes for men who do TRT when they see an age-related decline in testosterone production: exogenous testosterone use increases the risk of prostate cancer as high T (and DHT) levels are a risk factor for prostate cancer. The longer you stay at elevated levels, the greater your risk is. The same is true for women regarding estrogen and breast cancer.<br><br>Detransitioners likely see more impact from HRT &quot;the second time around&quot; because taking hormones and drugs which are actively destroying your HPTA function, therefor suppressing your test production for probably months upon months after cessation of treatment (depending on the length, dose, and substances used in said treatment) will give estrogen a much smaller proverbial hill to climb to become the dominant hormone over testosterone. You don&#039;t just &quot;bounce back in a few weeks&quot; after taking estrogen for 6+months and having T levels 1/10th of a healthy male, if that. I&#039;ve yet to hear of any evidence to suggest that exogenous estrogen administration in males DOESN&#039;T shut down the HPTA - and considering that you can use &quot;monotherapy&quot; doses of estrogen to nuke T, you might as well treat HRT as if it has the potential to cause HPTA disruption and hypogonadism similar if not equal to the level of male AAS users. That being: the longer the time on exogenous hormones + the higher the dose of the compound = the larger the damage (likely permanent) to the HPTA.

Raloxifene reduces risk of non-invasive breast cancer by about 38 percent compared to tamoxifen reducing risk for this type of cancer by about 50 percent. So raloxifene is about 78 percent as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of noninvasive breast cancer over almost 7 years. This suggests that tamoxifen may be more effective.but raloxifene has fewer harmful side effects than tamoxifen and may be a better choice for some women. Especially because you would busing it to prevent breast growth, not treat cancer, I&#039;d opine that the risk/benefit calculation favors ralox over tamox. Tamox is a riskier option and more appropriate in treating serious diseases like breast cancer than cosmetic concerns like gynecomastia. However, ralox still increases risk of VTE/serious blood clots, as do estradiol and progesterone. So take the minimum dose of each medication necessary and avoid smoking. In STAR, women in the raloxifene group had 28 percent fewer deep-vein thromboses (blood clots in a major vein) and 20 percent fewer pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in the lung) than women on tamoxifen: 118 of 9,736 women in the tamoxifen group had a deep-vein thrombosis compared to 86 of 9,754 women in the raloxifene group.", "time": 1673223220, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29103414, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:23:01", "name": "Anonmous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29102966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29102966</a><br>you might want to get liver enzymes tested with that routine (AST/ALT)<br>also read below<br><br><a href=\"#p29103164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29103164</a><br>the estrogen cycling thing doesn&#039;t sound like a good idea to me, I&#039;d much rather go with a serm if I were you.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy.

It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH.&quot;</span>", "time": 1673351436, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29123170, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29123156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29123156</a><br>So I need high LH and FSH to get big boobs?<br>Just tell me what pills I need to shove up my butt, I&#039;ll do it.", "time": 1673351564, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29124849, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)10:38:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "anyone here know where to get tretinoin without prescription? am in eu", "time": 1673365105, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29125109, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:03:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do my boobs hurt so much?", "time": 1673366637, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29125114, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:04:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122113</a><br>pls", "time": 1673366671, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29125169, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:09:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122113</a><br>don&#039;t worry about a tiny bit of leakage, but if it&#039;s a lot keep the syringe in for a bit after you&#039;re done injecting<br>also inject slowly and steadily<br>pinch inject also helps<br><a href=\"#p29125109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29125109</a><br>because you&#039;re growing some, it&#039;s normal", "time": 1673366958, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29125266, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:21:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29125169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29125169</a><br>alright thanks i&#039;ll keep that in mind next time, i think it was more than a tiny bit though but i&#039;m good and dont need to inject again right?", "time": 1673367672, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29125272, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:21:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29101029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29101029</a><br>Yes?

You don&#039;t need to cut it by 50%. You need to cut it by 95%. And instead of a &quot;guess&quot; you should actually test your levels.

From their cross-cultural and cross-species review, Ford and Beach (1951) concluded that homosexual behavior is an evolved capacity in humans, inherited from mammalian ancestry, not a pathology. A significant basis for this conclusion came from their review of MIMH in various human societies and primate species.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neill (2009) argued that male homosexual hebephilic relations work to produce emotional bonds between younger and older partners, which benefit youths by enhancing role-modeling tendencies, which in turn facilitate their acquiring skills and traits and assimilating beliefs and norms that they will shortly need to function successfully when fully grown.

I feel like my transition would have worked out better if doctors gave the same attention to trans hormones.", "time": 1673438564, "resto": 29121885}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29125991, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:37:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/hornygen/", "com": "For horny", "filename": "4684", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 655, "h": 638, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 243, "tim": 1673372226588189, "time": 1673372226, "md5": "m/RD/tIJJok/R7VAvWrrMA==", "fsize": 77088, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hornygen", "replies": 160, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 42, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 29126011, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:38:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29125991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29125991</a>", "filename": "1672698424253438", "ext": ".gif", "w": 326, "h": 326, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673372315264362, "time": 1673372315, "md5": "x63YVzCoTo6tqjOEkDMFmg==", "fsize": 329571, "resto": 29125991}, {"no": 29126045, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:41:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ok who wants to be my fuckdoll for tonight?", "time": 1673372481, "resto": 29125991}, {"no": 29126134, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29125991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29125991</a><br>What&#039;s the superior option?

The difference is they speak slowly in comparison to women and straight men usually have a less expressive vocal range than gays and women.<br><br>For real, if you&#039;re the quiet type of ftm who likes to let others speak more in conversation rather than the talkative type who overexplains everything as if the other person is a retard that knows nothing about even the most basic shit, fix that. There&#039;s a reason women invented the term &quot;mansplaining&quot;. Their definition of &quot;mansplaining&quot; is just the way men talk to anybody, including each other. Difference is men don&#039;t get offended by others&#039; mansplaining.

That is to say, while the twinkish, youthful physical appearance, often bordering on androgyny, is a commonality of the catboy aesthetic, I believe it arises more from the &quot;boy&quot; than the &quot;cat.&quot; A catboy is considered a cat in the sense that they adopt associations with cats that people find attractive. i.e, to be a catboy is to be, lithe, agile, graceful, playful, and in extreme cases, invoke the anachronistic antics of cats, interpreted through the lens of human eccentricity. <br><br>However, there is nothing mutually exclusive about being a man, or even masculine, that clashes with being a cat. Instead of imagining a boy who acts like a playful and lovey kitten, imagen a man who is, sly, standoffish, easy come easy go, and uncomfortable with expressing attraction despite being really loving deep down. Instead of a kitten, think of the wily magic cat from folklore, or the grouchy but loveable family house pet. <br><br>To better elucidate what I mean here, consider the divide between what we consider a &quot;catgirl&quot; and a &quot;catwoman.&quot; A catgirl is a cutesy, anime-inspired pop astetic, whereas a catwoman is more associated with femdom bdsm. <br><br>I think that the last few generations have shown a worrying trend of fetishizing youth to an unhealthy degree, and while there is undoubtedly beauty in youth, learning to reconcile ones mature body with one&#039;s ascetic preferences is key to a happy and long life. Many, of what we would call &quot;boomerhons&quot; are off putting in large part because they invoke fashion choices they simply cannot pull off.

If you have green tinged beard shadow you need a pink-to-red palate corrector, if your beard shadow is blueish, you need dark-peach-to-light-peach palate. The lighter your skin, the lighter the corrector needs to be. I&#039;m pale and have green tinged shadow so I use a medium pink colour corrector (not the bright pink kind used under the eyes).<br><br>The process for getting CC to work best:<br>1) Apply a good makeup primer. I use ELF&#039;s poreless putty primer. Wait a couple of mins, then:<br>2) Apply some colour corrector to a flat surface and work into the tips of the bristles of a dense, stiff bristled brush and stipple it onto the beard shadow areas with a repeated tapping motion. You are aiming to drive the colour corrector INTO the skin where the shadow is, not just on top of it. Use a little bit at a time! You shouldn&#039;t be using so much that you look super orange. I use LA Girl&#039;s colour corrector line. I think it gives much better results than the palate colour correctors usually recommended for this.<br>3) Apply a good quality bb corrector using your fingers to spread it over your face. This will give a smoother texture than using a beauty blender or brush. I use Missha BB Cream in shade #21.

considered GF but definitely mommy.<br><br>Experience 1:<br>During that awful COVID summer of 2020, I met a cis lesbian online who lived long distance, not like the other side of the world or anything but we definitely were not going to be meeting up any time soon. We started talking, she quickly revealed she was a top/dom, and pretty soon that let to sexting, and then to near nightly phone sex. She would have me call her mommy, and make me edge myself until I was begging and whimpering to cum. It progressed as we kept talking to each other and we divulged our fantasies to each other. She would tell me about all the things she wanted to do to me: lock me in chastity and peg me, tie me down, edge me repeatedly, dress me up in slutty outfits and take me out to dinner locked while teasing me relentlessly, the list goes on. She made those months tolerable, even pleasant. I think we even began to grow into something more than just fuckbuddies, we&#039;d have cute virtual little zoom dates where we&#039;d watch a show or something and flirt. Anyway eventually she met someone irl and had to end things. It hurt but we both knew long distance wasn&#039;t going to work out for either of us long term. We aren&#039;t on bad terms but we don&#039;t talk very much anymore. I hope she&#039;s doing well<br><br>Experience 2:<br>This was in the fall of 2021. I had made a post on a queer personals sort of app that I was seeking a &quot;mommy domme&quot; lol. Surprisingly, there were a couple hits. This one woman I met was into being called mommy and we quickly clicked. It was made even hotter by the fact that she was almost twice my age (I was 18, she was in her mid 30s). Anyway, we facetimed and stuff and were just talking and flirting and talking about what we were into I guess. Eventually she started telling me about how she was going to suck on my HRT breasts hard to train them to make milk just for her.", "time": 1673389053, "resto": 29126049}, {"no": 29129224, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)17:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29129186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29129186</a><br>CONT.<br>Then she told me to go to a more private place and had me get off for her.
