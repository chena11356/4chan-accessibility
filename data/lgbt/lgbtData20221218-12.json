Running out of money.<br>2. Planet Fitness is charging me $20 a month because they only take payments via connecting your bank account to them and I&#039;m not doing that, I know they&#039;ll rape my ass hard if I do that. Since I can&#039;t pay them that way I can pay them after late fees are accrued via a debit card, which they don&#039;t save. Late fees mean I pay double the amount per month. This connects to problem 1. <br>3. Don&#039;t have a plan for paying for college yet, my payment due date (or the date by which I need to sort out a payment plan with my school) is in the first week of january. Things are coming to a head. <br><br>Solutions:<br>1. Get a job. I can get one at McDonalds really easy, they pay $15 an hour, that&#039;s good enough for me. They do same-day interviews sometimes too so it shouldn&#039;t be a month-long process like some jobs I&#039;ve had.<br>2. Set up a secondary &#039;decoy&#039; debit account at my bank to run my gym payments through, so when I eventually cancel my membership (long time down the line, possibly years), they can&#039;t fuck my ass by continuing to charge my direct account, which I would then need to cancel. This would help me avoid $10 a month in late fees. Maybe not worth the effort. <br>3. Check my financial aid tab on my college website tomorrow morning after my morning routine. I&#039;ve worked out that I have enough time free in an average week to have a 20hr a week part-time job + college classes + 3 hours of studying per credit hour a week while maintaining 8 hours of sleep and 2 hours of prep time before school for working out, grooming, and chilling as well as an hour for reading before bed. If I set up a payment plan with my school, I can easily pay for the whole semester over time with room for modest savings and some spending on my hobby. The alternative is to take out a student loan, which would be totally fine, not a problem with that. It might even be financially optimal, I just don&#039;t like being in debt. <br><br>Everything is going to be ok.", "filename": "1671132604792753", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1822, "h": 1471, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1671334292179474, "time": 1671334292, "md5": "jF2UISQD+ZQ7pqrnp2ukWQ==", "fsize": 300103, "resto": 28799112}, {"no": 28799612, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:32:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you say any variant of tldr I&#039;ll find you and lick your asshole.", "time": 1671334374, "resto": 28799112}, {"no": 28799618, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:33:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "boring blogposting hours", "time": 1671334410, "resto": 28799112}, {"no": 28799626, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:33:49", "name": "heart", "com": "<a href=\"#p28799598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28799598</a><br>didnt read any of that but whos the qt in your pic", "time": 1671334429, "resto": 28799112, "trip": "!nXqq5IVBDM"}, {"no": 28799630, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:34:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "you get diagnosed with adhd and suddenly your bf wants to open up the relationship", "time": 1671334453, "resto": 28799112}, {"no": 28799631, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:34:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28799542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28799542</a><br>You were 24 talking to a 15 year old.

As a child I was very attracted to women, but being short and Indian in the ghetto areas of South Florida limited girls attraction to me. When I realized that black girls (the population I was predominantly aorund) didn&#039;t find me attractive, I started kind of gravitating to transsexual porn, around the age of 13. I had lots of internal hatred for my environment and the people that I was around in highschool which made me view everyone with a certain cynicism. I had essentially ruined my 4 years of highschool in 1 year(freshman). Although my internal hate would die down, I no longer had social skills due to being a loner for so long. This gradually made me depressed and anxious to the point that I developed severe insomnia where I slept 3 hours a night from age 16 to age 18. This insomnia made me suicidal, all the while I comforted myself with gay and transsexual porn since I genuinely believed women didn&#039;t find me attractive. Eventually I decided that I would kill myself at 21, but I took LSD at the age of 20 and it kind of reset my brain to before all the traumatic feelings happened. My porn use developed into me downloading grindr just to see if I am liked on that side. This eventually turned into my first hookup with a transwoman, and I&#039;ve had about 9 hookups since. I am now basically dating a transwoman, but I feel confused. Not about the relationship, but about my actual sexuality. Can I be bisexual if I have never been able to reach sex with biological women? If I&#039;ve never actually had a relationship with biological women? I&#039;m still very attracted to them and I want to experience sex and love with biological women.

The castaways begin exploring the island, only finding bottles and cans washed ashore. The gatherers start fermenting juice and trying to preserve the food. Instruments are fashioned and played nightly at the communal dinner. People settle in to island life. The initial burst of cooperative work starts to falter. The boymoders have remembered their womanhood and have begun sleeping with the men. But there&#039;s so few men and so many boymoders. The men are only human and when surrounded by so many tan, lithe moders have fallen into polygamous groups of 3-4, leaving the majority of the moders alone and envious of those in relationships. The lonelimoders start harassing the luckimoders. The men realize their power and start influencing society through promises of sex. The men use promises of sex to redirect more resources towards luxury goods towards themselves. Infrastructure projects slow as moders spend time trying to win sex from the men.

The gender imbalance threatens the stability of society. They decide things need to change. They write a constitution and begin circulating it among the lonelimoders. The revolution is quick the decadent men are placed under arrest by hunters and taken before the council. The council announces the Declaration of the Rights of Boymoders. Boymoders will be given tokens that entitle them to sex with a man. The men will be allowed to keep their houses, but really these resplendent abodes will act as brothels. The construction moders have crafted restraints that will greatly inhibit their ability to run. It is under the purview of the hunting group to assign a protector who will make sure the men cannot escape, and also that the men are not oversexed. The medical moder has decided that each man can copulate up to four times a day, meaning a boymoder will only need to go about 4 days before she can have sex again. In celebration of the revolution a feast is held using the liberated wealth of the men. The wine is ready for the first time, getting everyone quite drunk. The men are smothered in boymoders who grope and tease them until the morning. The next day the moders begin working on their new equitable society.

B/X is a much more elegant game than 5e. Combat is over in 1-3 rounds and doesn&#039;t have inflated HP totals. The XP system rewards treasure hunting over combat, which synchronizes with the core dungeon crawling gameplay loop instead of wandering through a line of railroaded DM plot points. The game only has 4 human classes and 3 nonhuman races, which is all you need for classic fantasy - a city full of mushroom people isn&#039;t so mystical in 5e when you have warforged astral self monks and psionic tiefing knights at home. That, and you don&#039;t have to make charisma rolls for intimidation or persuasion which means you won&#039;t be foiled by the d20 after actually doing good roleplaying. <br><br>5e doesn&#039;t use 3d6 down the line because you need to roll skill checks for absolutely everything.

Like there is something I do still like about how men interact with each other and form bonds that I&#039;m not really able to experience anymore.

When it comes to the expectations and roles we have for men in society, they kinda get pissy when they are expected to conform to that as men. Before I transitioned I knew a trans dude who would always perform the &quot;I&#039;m the woman&quot; kinda card with me whenever it came to needing to do any physical labor, but without actually calling himself a woman or anything, he just implied that it wasn&#039;t his job or whatever to do that sorta stuff. Which was extra irritating because I&#039;ve always been a failed-male and he was easily stronger than me and more fit for that stuff. I never let him pull that shit on me though, but he&#039;d do it to others. <br><br>Another trans dude I met in college would constantly bitch to me about how hard it was to date as a trans man, and how nobody was into trans men. Which sure, its harder. But I know he meant it in the sense that nobody was approaching him or hitting on him anymore, and it took him well over a year to grasp the concept that as a man, you gotta make the moves.
