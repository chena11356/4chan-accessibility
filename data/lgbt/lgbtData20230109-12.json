There are 5 classical elements in Greek, Indian, and Chinese mythology (the 5th gets often shortened to 4 for the Greeks, though). Romans have a numeral dedicated to 5, while most other numbers require multiple digits. Chinese abacus&#039;s group numbers by 5 as well.

Gatekeeping is always a fucking stupid position to take bar the defacto bad faith arguments like &quot;why can&#039;t I marry a horse!&quot; or &quot;pedos are lgbt too!&quot;, in which case just ignoring the latter is hardly gatekeeping as it&#039;s universally an attempt to gain attention", "time": 1673261406, "resto": 29107590}, {"no": 29109168, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:53:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29109019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29109019</a><br>people have the right to be retarded", "time": 1673261633, "resto": 29107590}, {"no": 29109235, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)06:05:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29109143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29109143</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do to stop a vegan that eats meat</span><br>I will make sure that everyone knows they&#039;re not actually vegan.<br>If there&#039;s benefits for being vegan they shouldn&#039;t have access to it.

The same goes for men who do TRT when they see an age-related decline in testosterone production: exogenous testosterone use increases the risk of prostate cancer as high T (and DHT) levels are a risk factor for prostate cancer. The longer you stay at elevated levels, the greater your risk is. The same is true for women regarding estrogen and breast cancer.<br><br>Detransitioners likely see more impact from HRT &quot;the second time around&quot; because taking hormones and drugs which are actively destroying your HPTA function, therefor suppressing your test production for probably months upon months after cessation of treatment (depending on the length, dose, and substances used in said treatment) will give estrogen a much smaller proverbial hill to climb to become the dominant hormone over testosterone. You don&#039;t just &quot;bounce back in a few weeks&quot; after taking estrogen for 6+months and having T levels 1/10th of a healthy male, if that. I&#039;ve yet to hear of any evidence to suggest that exogenous estrogen administration in males DOESN&#039;T shut down the HPTA - and considering that you can use &quot;monotherapy&quot; doses of estrogen to nuke T, you might as well treat HRT as if it has the potential to cause HPTA disruption and hypogonadism similar if not equal to the level of male AAS users. That being: the longer the time on exogenous hormones + the higher the dose of the compound = the larger the damage (likely permanent) to the HPTA. Lower test levels = more effective administration of estrogen HRT treatment as there is less &quot;competition&quot; to be the dominant hormone. <br><br>Less T to compete with upon administration of hormones, a weaker HPTA to nuke to ensure the exogenous hormones stay dominant, and a &quot;familiarity&quot; with the E dominant physiology is a more likely explanation than &quot;developing receptors&quot;.", "time": 1673214582, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29101617, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)16:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29101539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29101539</a><br>if you look at the infographic in the op, there&#039;s some guidelines for dosing early in transition.

Raloxifene reduces risk of non-invasive breast cancer by about 38 percent compared to tamoxifen reducing risk for this type of cancer by about 50 percent. So raloxifene is about 78 percent as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of noninvasive breast cancer over almost 7 years. This suggests that tamoxifen may be more effective.but raloxifene has fewer harmful side effects than tamoxifen and may be a better choice for some women. Especially because you would busing it to prevent breast growth, not treat cancer, I&#039;d opine that the risk/benefit calculation favors ralox over tamox. Tamox is a riskier option and more appropriate in treating serious diseases like breast cancer than cosmetic concerns like gynecomastia. However, ralox still increases risk of VTE/serious blood clots, as do estradiol and progesterone. So take the minimum dose of each medication necessary and avoid smoking. In STAR, women in the raloxifene group had 28 percent fewer deep-vein thromboses (blood clots in a major vein) and 20 percent fewer pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in the lung) than women on tamoxifen: 118 of 9,736 women in the tamoxifen group had a deep-vein thrombosis compared to 86 of 9,754 women in the raloxifene group.", "time": 1673223220, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29103414, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)19:23:01", "name": "Anonmous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29102966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29102966</a><br>you might want to get liver enzymes tested with that routine (AST/ALT)<br>also read below<br><br><a href=\"#p29103164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29103164</a><br>the estrogen cycling thing doesn&#039;t sound like a good idea to me, I&#039;d much rather go with a serm if I were you.

I was in a similar place (and sometimes find myself back there), but I found cognitive behavioral therapy to have a great impact on my perspective on life.

Not only are these responses very immediate and demoralizing, they also tend to overlap with thought-terminating cliches.

I think it&#039;s immensely useful to have a vocabulary for these kinds of thoughts so that when you do find yourself thinking these things, you can challenge them. &quot;I failed my chem test, I&#039;m such a worthless student&quot; but aha! that is all or nothing thinking, passing or failing one test does not decide your overall success as a student.", "filename": "ants", "ext": ".png", "w": 942, "h": 1324, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673239786196754, "time": 1673239786, "md5": "3nE/B1dzCHHoBQadwEgA7g==", "fsize": 292317, "resto": 29101662, "trip": "!yPk3lg2r32"}, {"no": 29106488, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:52:04", "name": "Seal", "com": "<a href=\"#p29106457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29106457</a><br>oh, and I can turn my trip off since I&#039;m out of my containment thread<br>I know anons can be touchy about that sort of thing", "time": 1673239924, "resto": 29101662, "trip": "!yPk3lg2r32"}, {"no": 29106893, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)00:30:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29105091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29105091</a><br>Math can be fun!

The law in the Bible explicitly prohibiting homosexuality is one of the Mosaic laws, along with not eating pork and other Jewish laws, which are generally not thought to be applicable to Christians. However, some Christians believe that some of the Mosaic laws, like the prohibition of homosexuality, are part of the &quot;moral law&quot; and are applicable to Christians. Jesus never condemns homosexuality or talks of it, but he does talk of &quot;porneia&quot; which means &quot;sexual immorality&quot; and may be interpreted as being inclusive of homosexuality given the context in which he preached, again contentious. Then there is the writings of Paul which do not prohibit homosexuality explicitly but do talk disparagingly of it. However, he may have been talking about pederasty. There is also the fact that the Bible is not seen as the word of God but as a compilation of writings inspired by God, therefore some books may be taken as flawed and a product of its time, especially when a character such as Paul talks rather than God, Jesus, or a chosen prophet. Contrary to what you may hear, there is a wide variety of opinion amongst Christians and liberal interpretations can be argued for. It is a complicated issue.<br><br>As a Christian Deist (but not a Christian) and as a Perennialist, I believe the Bible should be taken as a sign of caution with regards LGBT issues, that homosexuality is not ideal and does come at a cost, but in the spirit of Mark 2:27, this may be adapted where doing so seems healthy. For instance, discouraging bisexuality (a choice), but permitting exclusive homosexuality in a monogamous context. The same goes for transgenderism, though there is nothing explicitly anti-trans in the Bible (besides the murky question of whether a MtF paired with a male commits homosexuality), and generally both anti-trans and pro-trans arguments require more imaginative interpretation since the Bible says so little which is directly permittable.", "time": 1673228124, "resto": 29103356}, {"no": 29104401, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)20:38:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29104360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29104360</a><br>One of the arguments that one may make against transgenderism is that it goes against God&#039;s commandment to be fruitful and multiply.

So I really played up my weird awkwardness and then started talking about how much I loved the mormon church and hated weed and talked over him to turn him off cause he mentioned smoking weed with me and I was like...maybe if I act crazy it will turn him off. But like I am not mormon I only went to the mormon church a couple times with a weird mormon aunt once and it seemed like it worked for her to make her an old spinster unattractive to men. But it didnt work so well cause teen boys are more persistent plus like my friends had told him I crushed on him. So he followed me to classes for a while and I just acted like a weird bitch till he left me alone. Told my friends he seemed too much like a fuckboy to date seriously but it was one of those dumb &quot;oh youre playing hard to get&quot; dramas for a while. But like nah I was just gay and stupid.

This data is one of the bases of he informed consent approach to HRT, since it shows anyone put on the wrong HRT is likely to tell you they want to stop taking it ASAP due to the rebound dysphoria effect it&#039;s likely to cause if its wrong for you.<br><br>That&#039;s on top of the research later done on trans children themselves which shows they rarely change their minds.", "time": 1673226909, "resto": 29102761}, {"no": 29104116, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)20:17:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29103928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29103928</a><br>when I was 5 I knew I was gay<br>the idea that transgenderism precedes sexuality is false<br>we can&#039;t study that because homophobia is too dominant in our society <br>being gay is taboo - saying trannies are homophobic is considered politically incorrect even if it is so <br>the only source I have is this:<br>https://docdro.id/GLNstF1<br>a survey of trans political beliefs showing they are WAY more conservative than gay people, and even cis straight men <br><a href=\"#p29103991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29103991</a><br>trans people hate gays too - ask how many trannies think two flamers kissing is gross", "time": 1673227026, "resto": 29102761}, {"no": 29104160, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)20:20:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29103847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29103847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Child transitions have only just begun to erupt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THEY DONT CHANGE THEIR MIND!
