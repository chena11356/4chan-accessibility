However, to then say that the children being groomed into transitioning and then trafficked as prostitutes cannot possibly be AGP because they are the ones being preyed upon is a disgusting exercise in semantics done only to justify their theory that autogynephilia is the root of all evil. It doesn\u2019t matter to a predator why their victim might be interested in transitioning, all that matters is that they have an interest; young AGP boys clearly would be (and are) their preferred victims. An oft-repeated wish among transitioned AGPs is their desire to have transitioned earlier, sometimes at the very start of puberty, believing that this would have enabled them to pass better as women later in life (which on top of not necessarily being true, is also extremely detrimental to one\u2019s health and should be a criminal offense for any doctor willing to carry it out). AGP internet erotica pretty much exclusively fetishizes young transitioners, in part because younger trans women are the most sexually prized in these circles.</span>", "time": 1673955616, "resto": 29208468}, {"no": 29217098, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)06:40:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29212443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29212443</a><br>We&#039;ll be full at that time, fuck off", "time": 1673955626, "resto": 29208468}, {"no": 29217109, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)06:42:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29216752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29216752</a><br>the fuck are you even talking about mate?<br><br><a href=\"#p29217098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29217098</a><br>fuck<br>what if i move to poland first?", "time": 1673955756, "resto": 29208468}, {"no": 29217130, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)06:46:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29210558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29210558</a><br>Hardly any families are benefits frauds on any kind of scale.

I relate a lot, obviously. The feeling of it just getting worse and nothing changing for the better as the days disappear you is madeening. When I turned 25 my depression and addictions got so much worse because I figured it was too kate. I have done up to 75 gpd and it is miserable. For a while was like drinking and chainsmoking 5 cigarettes on top of that and the only reason that stopped was I realized drinking just made me more dramatically suicidal. Cigarettes and kratom are a gross combo but I just have to escape myself somehow and find a sense of some calm away from the restless regret.<br><br>Im sorry you are going through this too. Its so fucking confusing and torturous. I feel like if I quit kratom my depression would kill me too or Id have to transition just to feel like maybe, possibly there is some glimmer of hope. I really am convinced its over, but suicide is really not what anyone wants to do even if its the only logical option. Ive been really close a few times and when Im really there it is terrifying. This world seems so mundane and normal but the concept in my head of transitioning to be a girlfriend feels like a dream. If I went for it reality would feel warped almost. It is insane on some level. But I also think we are only alive once. We will die someday. Maybe going for it even if it is ridiculous is the only way to actually live a little. Maybe we are just fucking insane. If I knew I coukd get a boyfriend or a relationship as a girl I\u2019d do it cause that is the point. But Im so so worried that it will just be the last straw that brings it all down. That Id go fucking crazy and wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Atleast it happens slowly so you can integrate it a bit at a time. I wish I was just desperate to be a girl so even not passing but just being feminine would make it all worth it. I like being feminine and would like the changes.", "time": 1673888019, "resto": 29196610}, {"no": 29206272, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)12:07:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29206147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29206147</a><br>But trying to live life as a non passing lonely trans girl would be extremeLy difficult. I could always boymode forever but the breasts freak me out. Like if I pass and have breasts then awesome. But if I cant hide in the safety of presenting make then I will feel trapped. <br><br>The problem is that Im not sure there are other options. We waited a long time out of uncertainty and it turns out its never going away. We are already trapped. Some people say the mental effects alone are worth it. I think soon Im going to try hrt for a month and see how it feels. Im also worried that being on kratom will fuck that up though. The withdrawal from kratom can take a year to reset your brain to normal and I don\u2019t think I have a year. I feel like Im already impossibly behind and now its damage control. Some people do get lucky and pass after 25. Some people get ffs at 33 and look absolutely stunning. Some people get boyfriends and feel the love they have been missing their whole life. I think just choosing to transition would force me to take over my life instead of passing it away with drugs and self neglect. But god fucking dammit its scary. I still live with my parents and my dad would never see me the same way again. My brother has even talked about our parents divorcing if my dad doesn\u2019t accept me. The thing is, I almost don\u2019t want him to. I don\u2019t want him to see me as a non passing woman. I can\u2019t imagine a greater shame than him pretending to not be disgusted as I walk around in womens clothes and makeup. He knows Im suicidal but he doesn\u2019t know why. He wants me to get off drugs but does he want afreak as a son? I posted my pic up there and I simply have no chance at fully passing. They are both flattering to my femininity. I look like fucking death. Im 6\u20193\u201d somehow I look both not masculine and way too masculine. My only hope would be ffs but I am a fucking loser neet.

I didn\u2019t transition so I could keep performing but now I feel like no amount of skill or recognition could make me happy. Without loving a boyfriend it may as well be nothing. But I always thought girls were pretty, I had crushes on them as a kid. I never wanted to fuck them and people assumed I was gay but I thought I wanted to have a gf. I even remember looking at straight porn as a teen. I\u2019m not sure if I always inserted as the girl but there have been times I got excited by a nice ass I guess. Why the fuck does sissy shit drive me so crazy though? Why do I want to swallow loads and be fucked until I am moaning if Im not gay? I literally fell in love with two men I was dating online. They made me feel better than Ive ever felt. Why did I feel the need to be so feminine with them? Like I couldn\u2019t talk unless it was in a gay voice. Is it that I don\u2019t believe they can be attracted to my make qualities? What if a guy told me he loved me for my male qualities? That sounds nice in ways but I cant be twinkish forever. Soon Ill be a middle aged man and they might leave me fir someone cuter. Then Ill have to fuck twinks and they wont stay with me either.

I had a hot tight leopard print dress, black patent leather heels, I did my hair up nice, had my tiara, and before a night of drinking we went to the Chinese buffet. You know how gross those places can be. After a night of dancing, guys buying me tons of beers, handjobs, blowjobs, and a buttfuck I somehow wound up outside a gas station wearing nothing but my heels, my diaper, a bra, and my tiara. The buffet and beer was working its way through me and the large diarrheas resulted in gravy leg all over my thighs. Not sure why I was running in circles trying to dodge the police, but I&#039;m lead to believe I stripped down inside and the attendant called the police. I don&#039;t like the cops so I get angry around them and wind up using my man voice. I remember yelling &quot;Come at me bro!&quot; and got tased and that took me down. It sucked, but I ripped it out of my leg and got back up because I was so high on drugs. I grabbed a squeegee and swung it like a sword and got tased again in my chest. That one really sucked and each time they shocked me I wound up shitting more. They moved in and handcuffed me and I promised to shit more in their car which I did. In processing they took my diaper and tiara which made me cry and I continued to make large diarrheas in my jail pants. They said they didn&#039;t have any diapers and I informed them that was going to be their problem.

My room is a mess and I don&#039;t even have a door to my attic room because my step father and I got into a fight because I&#039;m still living here and he smashed my door open in a drunken rage. He apparently made a name for himself at 18. I am a disgusting human being and a gay disappointment. I&#039;m not even a cool gay who has tons of sex or goes to parties either, I basically just tag along for whatever my one black top friend is doing if he lets me. I want to cry I feel like I&#039;ve completely failed as a gay person.<br>One would think I&#039;d even have at least 3K saved up to possibly move out, but I don&#039;t even have that. All I got is 2 totaled cars to my name and a beat-up car from 2004 that isn&#039;t even in my name", "filename": "HbG3Q2o5QT_9UUmAknsRe_GXgQdJRoFgJ6NLTI2oH_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 960, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673939234577985, "time": 1673939234, "md5": "0Qp1H+dk8bXwzOgptdK5ig==", "fsize": 77281, "resto": 29209747}, {"no": 29215703, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:18:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29215650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29215650</a><br>Happy bday<br>You have youth <br>You have a car<br>You have a job <br>You make decent money <br>You aren&#039;t fat <br>You dont have a disease <br>Your not in a wheelchair <br>Your not homeless <br>You can afford to get a place with a roommate <br>You aren&#039;t in prison <br>You aren&#039;t blind or deaf or even worst of all...bald <br>I lived in a shitty apartment with 3 other people right near college campus at your age.

You have a fucked up family that fucked you up mentally and gave you a low self esteem. Many such cases. The solution is to take a step back and be aware of your situation. Your problems stem from a root cause of low self esteem that makes it more likely for you to want to do stuff like quit a shitty job, drop out of college, either not take care of or be overly critical of your body, not want to make new friends, probably distracts your thoughts while driving, etc etc etc<br>You need to understand that you have had a fucked up life and that people who have such a life often wind up in far worse situations than you yourself have. You aren&#039;t a failure as a gay person, you are a success of a person coming from a broken home. Once you think about your future optimistically rather than with the assumption of failure you will be able to figure things out.

Mr. Girl thought Fuentes should be called a Nazi, Destiny preferred (at the time) to call him a Christian Nationalist. I believe this was largely a capitulation to keep the connection open to Fuentes, but Mr. Girl saw &quot;nazi&quot; as a statement of fact, whereas Destiny saw it as an unfair characterization of Fuentes&#039; mindstate. Regardless, this retarded debate was the core of the bridge burning and the beginning of the end of Mr. Girl&#039;s youtube channel. A smaller streamer on Fuentes&#039; platform decided to go nuclear on Mr. Girl and mass reported all of his videos, getting him perma&#039;d. After this, Destiny burned the Fuentes/Cozy bridge, but it was too late for Mr. Girl because he was now in a death spiral. <br><br>After catching a ban on Destiny&#039;s subreddit over this subject, Mr. Girl decided to burn the bridge with Destiny and smear him. He gaslight an impressionable girl (lavlune I think her name is?) into coming out with SA allegations against Destiny which she almost immediately recanted. After this he started going around to Destiny&#039;s sexual partners, many of which were not public knowledge, and started trying to gaslight them as well. The argument he was attempting to build was that Destiny had constructed a pattern of abuse where he would fuck a girl, then bring her on stream where chat would abuse her and she would ultimately become emotionally dependent on him. Unfortunately, this case proved to be neigh impossible to build because even the woman who dgg treated the worst (ana) did not agree with this characterization of events. <br><br>This obsession seems to have played a large part in Mr Girl&#039;s failure, as Destiny was Mr Girl&#039;s last &quot;mainstream&quot; connection, especially after burning the Lex bridge. I don&#039;t know what got Mr. Girl banned on twitter, but that was likely just the final nail in the coffin. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;are you proud of yourself for this post?</span><br>No.", "time": 1673913200, "resto": 29208793}, {"no": 29211510, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:00:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29211137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29211137</a><br>yeah bro i fucking hate anglos<br><a href=\"#p29211154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29211154</a><br>yeah it was totes the liberals and definitely not revolutionary socialists who got us the minimum wage, maximum hours, universal suffrage, gay liberation, trans healthcare, etc. magnus hirschfield, the chartists, the trade unionists and the stonewall rioters were famously very moderate people who loved capitalism.<br>fucking retard", "time": 1673913619, "resto": 29208793}, {"no": 29211547, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:02:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29211510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29211510</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah it was totes the liberals and definitely not revolutionary socialists who got us the minimum wage, maximum hours, universal suffrage, gay liberation, trans healthcare, etc. magnus hirschfield, the chartists, the trade unionists and the stonewall rioters were famously very moderate people who loved capitalism.</span><br>It actually was.

Both diet and exercise and pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity, but only the former was associated with loss of intra-abdominal fat. Pioglitazone increased total body fat, which preferentially accumulated in the lower body depot in both men and women. WHRs decreased in both groups. Abdominal fat cell size decreased (P = 0.06) after diet and exercise. No statistically significant changes in fat cell size were observed in pioglitazone-treated volunteers.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conclusions: In nondiabetic upper body obese subjects, increasing insulin sensitivity via diet and exercise accompanies reductions in visceral fat. Pioglitazone treatment also improves insulin sensitivity and lowers WHR, but this is due to a selective increase in lower body fat. This confirms a site-specific responsiveness of adipose tissue to TZD and suggests that improvements in insulin sensitivity by pioglitazone are achieved independent of changes in intra-abdominal fat.</span>", "time": 1673879088, "resto": 29203321}, {"no": 29204758, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)09:25:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29204673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29204673</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pioglitazone</span><br>I wish people started adding that pio is NOT a weight loss drug.
