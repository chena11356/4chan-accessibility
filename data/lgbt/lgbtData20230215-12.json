I started growing my hair out around there though and I looked stupid and bad with long hair until I transitioned. No clue if the looks would have lasted through adulthood, I definitely wouldn&#039;t have known how to take care of them properly though.<br>I look fine as a girl but I&#039;d definitely say I went down on the 10 scale rather than up. The problem is that if you&#039;re a woman you basically get attention just for existing, so I&#039;ve had guys try to fuck me in basically every friend group I&#039;ve been in post-transition. That makes it hard to judge comparatively.<br>So I guess I&#039;m about the same in terms of desirability, but only because of the free bonus points I get for being a woman. Also I might be weighing my male self higher just because I&#039;m a narcissist who wants to fuck myself but I have bias against my current appearance since it&#039;s the one I see in the mirror when I feel dysphoric.", "time": 1676357469, "resto": 29606176}, {"no": 29606376, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I was probably more attractive as a guy in a greasy homeless serial killer kind of way", "time": 1676357512, "resto": 29606176}, {"no": 29606394, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:53:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29606339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29606339</a><br>fair enough, but you are very pretty.", "time": 1676357586, "resto": 29606176}, {"no": 29606409, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29606322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29606322</a><br>serial killer vibes", "time": 1676357682, "resto": 29606176}, {"no": 29606418, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:56:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29606230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29606230</a><br><a href=\"#p29606237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29606237</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good looking as a guy</span><br>looks like a school shooter<br>WTF is wrong with you?<br><br>I wish I had never seen her guy picture.

will might be very cringe n very long n manic but whatever its valentines day and im a sad single wreck and i want to whine about this..<br>so basically i can&#039;t really get off unless i read smut or use my imagination. problem is because i&#039;ve never had sex before i always picture my first time when im trying to get off which doesn&#039;t really sound like a problem but i have to picture all the lead up as well. so usually it&#039;s established that me and a guy have been talking a while maybe he&#039;s already my bf, maybe he&#039;ll eventually become one, but yeah that&#039;s established and we&#039;re either going to his after a date or we&#039;re having a date at his and he stops and turns and asks to kiss me. we attempt kissing and its very awkward because i have no clue what im doing so we laugh about it for a bit but then it continues and we&#039;re like actually making out until i push i him away because i always imagine myself suddenly getting really dysphoric. he typically then holds me for a bit and because idk how sex is usually initiated it skips forward to him starting to get undressed while i sit there still feeling dysphoric. he comes over to me and tell me im being stupid n starts helping me get undressed, saying stuff like &quot;anonette you&#039;re body is so pretty u shouldn&#039;t hide it&quot; or something similar. he holds me while im naked for a bit then we starts kissing again n i can feel his dick against my own or my stomach or something and for a second it feels like my dysphoria is gone entirely. then typically after we stop kissing he plays with my dick a bit n that&#039;s when i start to tear up in the fantasy and irl. when it gets to point he&#039;s topping me i am straight up crying in my fantasy from a mix of dysphoria and the fact i never thought a guy would love me enough to fuck me. and usually it ends there and i just lie in my bed very down very sad maybe there&#039;s a couple tears but i felt so lonely today i just started bawling my eyes out. im sry for posting this anons is it srsly over for me?", "filename": "phno", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim":

the end of the show, I told her that I wanted her now. She said okay and then when we went to bed together, I undressed her and made out with her for like 10 minutes. She basically just waited for me to do anything, I could tell she was really nervous but she was really enjoying it at the same time. I kept telling her how beautiful she was while feeling her up. Whenever I called her anything nice, she would moan. I would go in to kiss her neck and holy shit she would breathe so fucking much from it. I couldnt tell if she was in ecstasy or running out of oxygen. Then after a bit, the ONE thing she initiated during the entire thing was that she turned around and said \u201c please fuck me\u201d. It was pretty cute, I had to finger her for a while because she was so damn tight. I only got to fuck her for about 1 minute before she came. She seemed so exhausted after cumming I decided to jerk the rest off and let her sleep. When I went back to bed, she told me she feels bad that I didnt get to cum in her but I had her curl up on me and then i went straight to sleep lol. Next round we did the next day went way better and I think she enjoyed that one alot more.", "time": 1676456005, "resto": 29620035}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29621285, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:49:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most &quot;bi&quot; women</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Super active in LGBT circles</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Always posting on girls photos &quot;I&#039;M SO GAY&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have had sex with one woman at most, relationship maybe lasted a few months at best.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A majority have only fucked men</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most bi men</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Almost all have had sex with partners of both genders</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;less obsessed with hypocritical heteronormative relationships</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Generally just date whoever they vibe with.</span><br><br>Why is this?", "filename": "CC8CEBE7-2117-462C-8221-FDC22876862C", "ext": ".png", "w": 676, "h": 707, "tn_w": 239, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676443787327960, "time": 1676443787, "md5": "wLQKVFTV8HVSlYmnFF0LFg==", "fsize": 52895, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "most-bi-women", "replies": 12, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 29621305, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:52:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bi women invariably get super annoyed when I called them faggots.
