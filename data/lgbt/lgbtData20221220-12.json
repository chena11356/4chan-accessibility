And they have very different physical symptoms.<br>Texanon claims to not know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is legitimately preposterous.<br>We know that Tex has intersex genitalia, meaning that he has a &#039;severe&#039; (for lack of a better word) form of intersexuality. This contrasts with some chromosomal forms of intersexuality which have little to no effect on a person&#039;s body, and can go undiscovered for life. Doctors would have noticed Tex&#039;s genitalia while he was in the womb. With Tex&#039;s parents&#039; permission, doctors would have been able to determine exactly what kind of intersexuality Tex had - if not before birth, then soon after. It is highly likely that Tex&#039;s parents would have given permission for these tests because it is medically important information. Different kinds of intersexuality have a profound effect on the body&#039;s interaction with certain medications, risks of medical conditions, cancers, etc. It is vital for a parent to know these things.<br>But okay. Maybe Tex&#039;s parents didn&#039;t get these tests done, or they did, but they never told Tex the results, leaving him unsure. It doesn&#039;t matter, because Tex has been hospitalised multiple times in his life, including as an independent adult. If Texanon couldn&#039;t tell the doctors what kind of intersexuality he has, they would have tested him immediately upon entry and told him the results. Again, this is vital medical information, like doing a blood test, there&#039;s no way to get around it.<br>(1/2)", "filename": "1601334410505", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 283, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1671524398630118, "time": 1671524398, "md5": "w1nSR8skX9wIXi9OJa2h8g==", "fsize": 27689, "resto": 28827989}, {"no": 28829308, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)03:21:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "(2/2)<br>Consider also that Tex takes medication, and that prescriptions vary for different sexes. The doctors prescribing his medication? They also need to know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is another case where he would be tested and told his results.<br>But maybe the greatest evidence that Tex is lying isn&#039;t any medical concerns, but simple self-identity. Can you imagine having a condition as major as intersexuality - one which places you apart from 99% of society - and not taking any steps to understand your situation? Living in ignorance about the workings of your own body? Knowing that you are neither male nor female, but not taking any steps to figure out what you are instead? It is ridiculous.<br>There&#039;s no way Texanon is intersex. I would bet money on it.<br>And I think the most interesting question here is: why is he lying? By labelling himself as intersex, Tex has attracted a lot of aggression and ridicule from /gaygen/. Why would someone willingly bring that upon themselves, especially someone like Tex who is so conflict-averse? We know that Texanon has issues with sex - is claiming to be intersex a way of desexualising himself in the gay community? Maybe Texanon is transgender or non-binary and pretending to be intersex gives them gender euphoria. I don&#039;t know.

Although... psychologists are fond of saying that &quot;anything is possible&quot; when trans people ask if it&#039;s possible for trauma to cause gender dysphoria. But then most psychs (like Dr. Z PhD) go on to explain that it&#039;s exceedingly rare for trauma to lead to even a single symptom, and that gender dysphoria is almost always the more likely culprit. Especially if someone has a whole bunch of signs/symptoms that point to the same thing.<br><br>Me? I keep telling myself that I have various feelings of &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; and &quot;gender euphoria&quot; but they are due to a rare confluence of things (like trauma) rather than being due to gender dysphoria. The reason I am able to convince myself of this is that I don&#039;t feel trans enough to be fully trans.

Does the fact that insane people exist mean I or most trans people are guilty of some kind of original sin?<br><br>I&#039;d also like to add that trans people have a ton of struggles such as inadequate healthcare from retard doctors who wildly speculate crap that doesn&#039;t exist.<br>For example, excess testosterone can become estrogen but the reverse is impossible. Many doctors presume it to be possible and factor that into their considerations because they are retarded NPCs who don&#039;t give a shit about doing their job right).<br>Knowing this, why the fuck would any of us care about cancelling people? That&#039;s bullshit lipservice from soulless companies pretending to care about people. If they actually wanted to help they could help fix things regarding healthcare etc.<br>If you honestly think that trans people WANT to be cast into the limelight and argued over then you&#039;re retarded. Can you imagine if Joe Biden got on stage and said &quot;you need to pretend that diabetic people aren&#039;t diabetic, even when it&#039;s really important to know whether or not they are.&quot; that diabetic people would appreciate that? For months or years, for the news to treat them as the latest hot topic? BREAKING: DIABETIC PEOPLE - SHOULD WE PRETEND THEY&#039;RE NOT DIABETIC?<br>Fuck no. You honestly think that would make ANY diabetic person&#039;s life better? Fuck no. It would just bother them as politically brainrotted retards just immediately think about (((current events))) any time they met you, and try to suss out whether you&#039;re &quot;one of those bad diabetics&quot; when you could&#039;ve just been seen as a human being.<br><br>If rich/powerful kikes who don&#039;t represent you at all started speaking for your entire group, could you really convince the world they&#039;re wrong?", "time": 1671526814, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830181, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)05:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28829236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28829236</a><br>you are the exception to the rule, try an actual black person they aren&#039;t allowed to express their own dating preferences", "time": 1671533097, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830210, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)05:48:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28825494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825494</a><br>Saying I don&#039;t date trans women is discriminating and a black guy saying sorry I don&#039;t date white people is discriminating too.", "time": 1671533335, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830234, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)05:53:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28825870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825870</a><br>Transwomen are women and transmen are men what&#039;s so hard to get about that?", "time": 1671533598, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830423, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:28:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28825472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825472</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i just want people to be nice to me and use the right pronouns</span><br><br><a href=\"#p28825625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825625</a><br>you dont get to dictate other people&#039;s beliefs or police their language<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tranner: pls be nice to me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chud: trannies want to dictate my beliefs reeee</span><br><br>You guys are a special kind of retards", "time": 1671535707, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830432, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)06:31:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28825750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825750</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gunpoint</span><br>Take your meds, schizo.", "time": 1671535908, "resto": 28825440}, {"no": 28830657, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:06:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28825440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28825440</a><br>What is a woman?", "time": 1671538003, "resto": 28825440}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28823159, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)17:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Is it transphobic to pay $70 for J.K.

Dysphoria results from the cyclical emotional oscillation between hope for stability and disappointment in its inattainability; a dependent-anaclitic depression arises from the mixture of anger, aloneness and inner emptiness which is so characteristic of the borderline syndrome. The tendency to be immersed in the here-and-now, an intra-festum mentality, exacerbates the sense of isolation, causing more irritation, mute frustration and, consequently, anger. The effects and ramifications of anger, and the resultant precarious cohesion of the self, are explored in the borderline syndrome; they are especially illuminated by the application of Kernberg\u2019s pain-anger-hate-vengefulness cycle concept. Meanings of solitude, in its forms of aloneness and loneliness, are explored in their pertinence. Aloneness \u2013 the constant needy search for, but condemnation to never finding, objects to fill an inner sense of emptiness \u2013 is especially germane. Suggestions for assisting subjects with borderline personality disorder to overcome aloneness and the lack of historical progression are made.</span>", "filename": "nazare-tedesco", "ext": ".gif", "w": 288, "h": 188, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1671480319696392, "time": 1671480319, "md5": "1ydVMTXhW2fq7hKtALTiEw==", "fsize": 2472685, "resto": 28811678}, {"no": 28821101, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)15:10:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28820976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28820976</a><br>Dilate harder tranny.", "time": 1671480640, "resto": 28811678}, {"no": 28821123, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)15:12:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28821101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28821101</a><br>Lol what", "time": 1671480745, "resto": 28811678}, {"no": 28821160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)15:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28821123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28821123</a><br>That tranny really wanted you to insult em.

In regards to having a child of your own, the technology just isn&#039;t there yet, and adopting doesn&#039;t feel right. For a relationship to actually be long term I feel like there absolutely needs to be a child to bond over. Finding a partner you can bond with over the simple things in life is incredibly hard, and even if you do find someone, you will have to deal with the potential fallouts of human interaction, the danger, the drama, it&#039;s just too much to handle. Not only that, if you&#039;re trans or somewhere in between that, most people attracted to that are just looking for something short term, they&#039;ll just dump you when you get ugly or get too old.

Socializing with people outside my age group feels wrong because all the dudes just wanna party and do young people things and the women just instantly fall in love with me. It&#039;s just such an alienated lifestyle, so lonely, so tiring. There&#039;s just no point to anything besides focusing on yourself imo, and those close to you, be they relatives, friends, or if you&#039;re lucky romantic. I&#039;d say focusing on the others is just a waste of time due to inherent biological expectations.
