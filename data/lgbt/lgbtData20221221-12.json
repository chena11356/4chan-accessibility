If you want to make a point that humans are also struggling against their instincts in cities, you need to outline exactly which instincts. Which Calhoun did not do, and our instincts are not mapped exactly to forming harems or killing babies, so you would be reaching pretty far into merely speculating. Plus, we have this thing called urban design, Calhoun could have designed the city differently but he didnt because he didnt bother to think about the social dynamics of mice (beyond the fact that animals need food anf shelter).

If the point is that cities dont work at all because the place will always overpopulate, that isnt even true given actual human urban demographic trends over time. Even in a problematically overpopulated city like Hong Kong, there are secluded private spaces, the issue is the size of those spaces for the poorest of the city, and many cities are not Hong Kong tier. Calhoun added too much noise and confounding factors. It&#039;s not all about having private spaces either, when we consider human (and not rat) behaviour, there&#039;s a large benefit both psychologically and even immunologically to interacting with greenery and that&#039;s an entirely separate issue unexplored in the mouse experiments, but which some cities have been trying to tackle by including green spaces and various parks within the city as well as encouraging people to take weekend trips into the countryside.", "time": 1671593676, "resto": 28838744}, {"no": 28840400, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)22:38:30", "name": "gunga", "com": "<a href=\"#p28838744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28838744</a><br>unrelated, the Iq of half the people in this thread is equivalent to the temperature of my piss in Celsius.", "time": 1671593910, "resto": 28838744}, {"no": 28841115, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)23:52:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28840243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28840243</a><br>you\u2019re wrong. i moved to a rural area and have to walk for an hour to get to the nearest grocery store (running its a half hour, or 20 minutes on bike).

We eventually became friends shortly after graduating, and I spent my late teenage and early 20s talking to them and hanging out with them. Part of what made it uncomfortably close was that we were both reppers, albeit as opposite sexes. I had no one else in my life that even knew what it could possibly be like to have dysphoric thoughts, and just few friends in general. We would drift apart and then end up finding each other again and again. I admitted having a crush on two separate occasions, but it was the most spaghetti filled confession you can imagine. I identified as asexual because of bottom dysphoria and could not separate not wanting to use my penis from not being in a relationship with anyone. My friend ended up being treated horribly by the people they trusted, and I found myself wanting to take care of them. I got so close I destroyed myself with anxiety as my friend took drugs to cope with life. By the time I confessed my feelings that second time, the very next day, they were raped. Everything got worse. Eventually I was completely flaking on my friend as their mental health deteriorated. The drugs continued, and just got more frequent. It was at the point where they were snorting ketamine in public restrooms while I was hanging out with them. Eventually a guy from back in highschool asked them out, and after that in the middle of breaking down they admitted that they had feelings for me for years, that had they not been raped things might have went differently, but now this guy is here and he wants to get married. I tried to hold an intervention later on but it didn&#039;t end well. We stopped talking for good and many people I once considered friends all turned on me when the final blow up was directed at me. I spent 8 years consciously and unconsciously pining after my closest friend. I hope that guy respects their rep but as far as I know he wants a tradwife.

This is super generic, yes, but the reason it works for things like depression is because it helps get your mental defenses back up, which makes slipping harder.

The only way to make something like what was proposed above work would be to appeal to something besides a universal principal, like by pitching it as something that would help society. There are some third gender roles in other cultures that I think have tried to make this case by basically striking the bargain that feminine males can live as women but they have to take on roles that free up cisgender women to either have more children or take on greater responsibilities in the community.

Public restrooms and locker rooms have mechanisms in place to keep out creeps already.
