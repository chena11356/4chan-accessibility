The next day I get a view from a straight guy who has no guys listed in his preferences, but I send him a wink anyway. He sends one back (!!!) and we exchange numbers. We talk about stuff and I ask him if he would eat my ass or spank me or shave his balls so I could suck them lmao and he&#039;s totally into it.<br>By the end of the week I&#039;ve got no bodyhair and I&#039;m wearing the tightest jogging pants possible and he&#039;s knocking on my door to come in and fuck me. We kiss for a while and he&#039;s grabbing my ass through the pants and I get on my knees and start sucking his dick, eventually I tell him to go back to his car to get a condom and I put some oil on myself to make it hotter, and he comes back and I sit on his face and I can see his dick and he shaved his balls and everything like I asked so I went to town on him.<br>Eventually he&#039;s fucking the life out of me and starts slapping my ass until he says &quot;I&#039;m gonna cum&quot; and I bend towards him and whisper in his ear &quot;Then fuck me harder&quot; and he starts slamming me so hard I bet the neighbors could hear his shaven balls hitting my shaven ass.<br>Anyway that&#039;s the straight guy I got to fuck me and it&#039;s far more interesting than your OP.", "time": 1675406985, "resto": 29446847}, {"no": 29446966, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)01:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29446847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29446847</a><br>The implication being &quot;straight men are OK with being in relationships with trans women&quot;?<br>I don&#039;t think I can count how many times I&#039;ve wished I were born afab, just so I could&#039;ve been normal and dated normal guys.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inb4 lgbt relationships are normal</span><br>Yh, I guess.

John gave me only his first name and informed me that I was the first to be told what he was about to tell me. He said he was &quot;gender dysphoric&quot; and that he was &quot;desperate.&quot; Feelings that were once &quot;controllable through sheer force of will,&quot; had increased to where he now was having protracted periods where he would close his office door, lie on the floor and weep quietly while curled up in the fetal position, holding his genitals in pain. Other than intrusive and repeated fantasies of being female, he had refused to allow himself any overt form of female gender expression. He reported feeling that if he was to cross-dress and be caught, he would dishonor his wife and family. Having attained international recognition for his work, he was also concerned about his professional reputation. The only other form of temporary relief came through masturbating, often up to five times a day.<br><br>Some gender dysphoric individuals proceed into their senior years with their needs and desires to be female still unresolved.

All of my 23 years on this earth I&#039;ve been telling myself that I&#039;m hetero, a few times over the years I&#039;ve really briefly had some random sexual thoughts about other men but those usually have come and gone away. To be fair I&#039;ve usually kind of repressed them a little, maybe because I&#039;ve been always surrounded with very homophobic people and mainly because they&#039;re usually only really about more feminine looking guys so I kind of would always rationalise them away by telling myself &quot;oh no I&#039;m not really attracted to guys, it&#039;s just that they remind me of women and I&#039;m attracted to women&quot;. Anyway, getting to the point, last night I went out to a rave and saw this guy there who I found really attractive, to the point where I started fantasising about making out with him and dancing with him and just feeling his body. I felt pretty out of my depth going up to him and trying to initiate anything because firstly the whole experience caught pretty off guard and secondly because I&#039;m usually pretty shy about approaching people in places like that anyway so I ended up not acting on anything while telling myself &quot;oh he&#039;s probably not into guys anyway&quot; which was unfortunate because I saw him later hooking up with another guy. After I left and this morning I kept thinking about him and other guys in a far more romantic and even sexual kind of way then I&#039;ve ever really done before. It all felt nice but I&#039;m feeling a little overwhelmed with how to deal with and what to think of the whole thing. Sorry about the blogpost, I don&#039;t really know anyone irl who I can talk to about all this who isn&#039;t going to most likely flip out and call me a faggot or something. :/", "filename": "images (29)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 437, "h": 702, "tn_w": 77, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675390512670944, "time": 1675390512, "md5": "68iwatD/MWSoSV9Qv6htZw==", "fsize": 39506, "resto": 29396509}, {"no": 29443997, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:18:49", "name": "Quill", "com": "<a href=\"#p29443961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29443961</a><br>You&#039;re very nice and I hope you feel better having typed it all out.", "filename": "20230102_120927-01", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1333, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675390729298647, "time": 1675390729, "md5": "I2Pn+kop8r9+f8qrnybmrA==", "fsize": 1017050, "resto": 29396509}, {"no": 29444212, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:37:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29443782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29443782</a><br>All his self reporting made everyone&#039;s job easier.

No need to worry about &quot;blogposting,&quot; you&#039;re free to write whatever you want here. <br>You sound remarkably like me, or at least, how I used to be up until about a year ago. Like you, I repressed a lot of thoughts I had about men for a long time (and how they were at odds with my equal interest in women). And as a response to that repression, I intentionally surrounded myself with homophobic people and ideas (I am very ashamed of this, but that&#039;s a different story). Those people and ideas that were constantly around me just compounded my own self-loathing and depression, no matter how much of a front I tried to put up. I even convinced myself that the people around me were my &quot;friends,&quot; though they would have scorned me if they knew who I was. <br><br>Anyways, processing these newly recognized feelings will take time and probably feel a bit scary, but hopefully it can be an interesting time of discovery and exploration for yourself as well.

We talk about stuff and I ask him if he would eat my ass or spank me or shave his balls so I could suck them lmao and he&#039;s totally into it.<br>By the end of the week I&#039;ve got no bodyhair and I&#039;m wearing the tightest jogging pants possible and he&#039;s knocking on my door to come in and fuck me. We kiss for a while and he&#039;s grabbing my ass through the pants and I get on my knees and start sucking his dick, eventually I tell him to go back to his car to get a condom and I put some oil on myself to make it hotter, and he comes back and I sit on his face and I can see his dick and he shaved his balls and everything like I asked so I went to town on him.<br>Eventually he&#039;s fucking the life out of me and starts slapping my ass until he says &quot;I&#039;m gonna cum&quot; and I bend towards him and whisper in his ear &quot;Then fuck me harder&quot; and he starts slamming me so hard I bet the neighbors could hear his shaven balls hitting my shaven ass.<br>Anyway that&#039;s the straight guy I got to fuck me and it&#039;s far more interesting than your OP.", "time": 1675407277, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29447026, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)01:58:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29447002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29447002</a><br>sounds like a good time", "time": 1675407497, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29447089, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:07:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29446540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29446540</a><br>Tfw getting plowed by a 55 year old<br>H-he looks young for his age <br>He has a thick cock, makes six figures and never shuts up about conspiracy theories", "time": 1675408053, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29447095, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29447089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29447089</a><br>sounds hot and super dilfy", "time": 1675408086, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29447190, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:20:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29447026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29447026</a><br>I should have sucked his dick a little less hard or took it out and slapped some sense into it, I think if he fucked me for a bit longer I would have cummed just from being topped.

It&#039;s just playing out in front of you and you should seize your opportunities. Do I regret fucking Him twice? No. Because if I fucked him once I would have always lamented not having the second time. Do I regret meeting the 40 year old? No. Because he could have been a beast in the sack. Were they both disappointing? Yes. But being disappointed is better than being regretful at not seizing an opportunity.", "time": 1675422778, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29448740, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:16:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29448724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29448724</a><br>i mean, i&#039;m a twink, and absolutely everyone say i&#039;m made for being bred so i kind of integrated that in me and like the idea now but the retarded sexuality i was talking about earlier aka me being gamp/gynephilic/whatever is an issue to find good match", "time": 1675422999, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29448743, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29448716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29448716</a><br>If you need to be coddled and provided for that&#039;s good too.", "time": 1675423023, "resto": 29446540}, {"no": 29448787, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:23:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29448743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29448743</a><br>Yes i think i do need that very much.

Like sure you may not like the idea of it, but you don&#039;t know until you try. You shouldn&#039;t get to my age and then seethe that your tastes have changed and you didn&#039;t jump some guy&#039;s bones because he wasn&#039;t x/y/zing enough for you. If someone is good looking and you&#039;re feeling horny, hit it up. You won&#039;t be young forever and you can keep it in your spank bank for the rest of your life.<br>I wasn&#039;t like an overly promiscuous fag btw, I just slept with some guys. I don&#039;t want you thinking when I say this I used to get pissed on by twenty dudes in a gay bar, I just think you should embrace your youth and attractiveness and try and steal moments and memories you can enjoy when you aren&#039;t at your peak looks wise anymore.<br>Sorry if this was an incredibly dumb/inappropriate response, I just think you should stop worrying about what you&#039;re attracted to and just go for it and have more sex, if you aren&#039;t having any sex at all you should step out of your comfort zone and you may find something you didn&#039;t know you liked. That&#039;s how I was with the 40yo, but I gave it a shot because it would make me cum and I was bored and if I loved it then I would have the ability to cum more lmao.

John gave me only his first name and informed me that I was the first to be told what he was about to tell me. He said he was &quot;gender dysphoric&quot; and that he was &quot;desperate.&quot; Feelings that were once &quot;controllable through sheer force of will,&quot; had increased to where he now was having protracted periods where he would close his office door, lie on the floor and weep quietly while curled up in the fetal position, holding his genitals in pain. Other than intrusive and repeated fantasies of being female, he had refused to allow himself any overt form of female gender expression. He reported feeling that if he was to cross-dress and be caught, he would dishonor his wife and family. Having attained international recognition for his work, he was also concerned about his professional reputation. The only other form of temporary relief came through masturbating, often up to five times a day.</span><br>isnt it funny how cruel this is? <br>you&#039;re part of the 1% of the population that feels like this, FYI its never going to get better,<br>what are you going to do about society, anon? are you gonna retaliate soon ?", "filename": "1673930633690561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 905, "tn_w": 176, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675377357793387, "time": 1675377357, "md5": "YHi2nTcCBgTskT1YTUkWdg==", "fsize": 135155, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-many-of-you-attempted-suicide-as-children", "replies": 38, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 26}, {"no": 29441327, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:36:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bruh moment tho", "time": 1675377414, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441373, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:41:15", "name": "sienna&#039;s revenge", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>i tried to stab myself in the chest when i was a kid<br>my parents laughed at me", "time": 1675377675, "resto": 29441318, "trip": "!TJvIWD.URQ"}, {"no": 29441423, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:44:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "not really, its really stupid but i remember being really young and holding my breath to see if it would kill me lol", "time": 1675377888, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441487, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:49:05", "name": "Freya", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>a few times over my life. maybe more in the future.", "time": 1675378145, "resto": 29441318, "trip": "!WTjQnjO02E"}, {"no": 29441511, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:50:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>My mom beat my ass when she found me hanging from the top bunk with a belt put me on adhd meds for years after lol what does that even have to do with that.", "time": 1675378238, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441514, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:50:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>im a chaser and tried to kill myself", "time": 1675378259, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441536, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:53:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>i tried to hang myself with a skipping rope in my primary school playground but i didn&#039;t know how to tie a noose so just fell to the ground while ppl stared at me. i remember also laying on the road outside my house when i was much younger hoping to get ran over but my mum would always come out and stop me before a car actually came", "time": 1675378387, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441582, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:56:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>i tried a few times in my early teens<br>idk if i would consider my bf a trans attracted male or whatever since he constantly tells me to stop saying ill never be a real woman<br>he doesnt claim to understand the trauma or pain but he does his best to help me through what im going through now<br><br>whyd you post john 50", "time": 1675378614, "resto": 29441318}, {"no": 29441588, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:57:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29441318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29441318</a><br>Yay schizo threads.<br>Made a schizo thread just 3 days ago.

The problem is that most people cannot consciously control the muscles that do this, nor can they consciously learn to do it by rote. Instead, the most effective approach is to create exercises that the conscious brain can focus on that basically trick your body into learning how to unconsciously control the right muscles and give you the muscle memory to be able to consistently do it on command. Because of how this works, you&#039;re better off trying different exercises and practising them all until you find the one(s) that work for you rather than spending your time intellectualizing them. <br><br>Big dog little dog, whisper siren, sliding from oooooo to eeeeeeee, and cat hissing are all just different tricks to try and teach your body to unconsciously do the same thing.

Basically, the goal is to shrink the space in your throat and your mouth (in the right way where it doesn&#039;t cause strain) so that your voice has a much smaller space to resonate in, which causes it to sound &#039;smaller&#039;. Making your voice sound smaller is the #1 most important goal of voice training, and it means you have to learn to raise the larynx in your throat, and to shape your mouth and tongue in such a way as to make the space inside your mouth smaller and so that it amplifies upper mid-range frequencies but dampens low range and super high frequencies.<br><br>The hard part is that most people cannot consciously identify and control the right muscles so you can&#039;t learn to do this by being told which muscles to use and learn it by rote practice. Instead, exercises try to teach you indirectly by giving you something to mentally focus on and mimic that can help you learn to unconsciously control the right muscles.<br><br>This is what all the popular exercises like big dog little dog, whisper siren, hissing cat, oooo to eeeee slides, and so on are trying to do. But since they&#039;re all indirect mental tricks, different ones work better for different people, and you should try a bunch to see which works best for you.<br><br>Once you have those two aspects of voice training down, then you can work on speaking a bit softer and on raising pitch, if necessary (but not too much!).", "time": 1675298818, "resto": 29413467}, {"no": 29429540, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29427446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29427446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;focus on is shaping your mouth cavity to shrink the space and emphasize upper mid range frequencies</span><br><a href=\"#p29429061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29429061</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shrinking and shaping the space in your mouth can make a HUGE difference to your sound</span><br>It does nothing even when I try because I have a very croaky voice naturally and even at a high pitch and a shrunken mouth my voice sounds wrong.

The problem is his teeny tinkle kept poking in a way that made him leak. So I helped him by rubbing him before bed time to soften things up. Really put him to sleep and desu it was really funny to see him go cross eyed before creaming his ninipanties. I think he started putting on girls clothes to try and impress me. DESU it was cute at first. But after I made it clear I&#039;ll never see him as BF material he started throwing tantrums again because she has trouble getting off outside her diapers.

I have an ftm friend who was an athletic butch, when he started taking testosterone he could run and lift 1.5 hours every day, increase his lifts every week, and even accidentally almost destroyed door hinges with his newfound strength. Meanwhile I&#039;m a tomboy who accidentally overdosed my testosterone into the high cis male range, for 6 months I was making progress in the gym from 3-5 sessions a week, but only at a modest pace slightly faster than the pace of the average woman.

What exactly will depend on the thickness of your hair as you don&#039;t want something too heavy if you have fine strands nor something too light if your&#039;s thick. Mousse can achieve this for fine hair while clay would work for thick hair. If you want a wetter look, pomades and waxes can work. Your hands and fingers can be used to style like this. I hear salt sprays also work well. Spritz a salt spray or leave-in conditioner into damp, freshly washed hair, then let it dry naturally and fall into place.

John gave me only his first name and informed me that I was the first to be told what he was about to tell me. He said he was &quot;gender dysphoric&quot; and that he was &quot;desperate.&quot; Feelings that were once &quot;controllable through sheer force of will,&quot; had increased to where he now was having protracted periods where he would close his office door, lie on the floor and weep quietly while curled up in the fetal position, holding his genitals in pain. Other than intrusive and repeated fantasies of being female, he had refused to allow himself any overt form of female gender expression. He reported feeling that if he was to cross-dress and be caught, he would dishonor his wife and family. Having attained international recognition for his work, he was also concerned about his professional reputation. The only other form of temporary relief came through masturbating, often up to five times a day.<br><br>Some gender dysphoric individuals proceed into their senior years with their needs and desires to be female still unresolved.

They had found cages on a farmhouse that seemed to have been used to keep children locked away.<br>The FBI continued working with border patrol and local police agencies and felt as though they were close to finding out the truth. They had flight logs, purchasing history, etc. and it all seemed to be pointing to an international child trafficking ring that involved incredibly rich individuals who had properties in a number of countries including all the way out in China.<br>All of a sudden the CIA came into the case, declared it an internal matter while sucking up all of the evidence.<br>Shortly thereafter the case was declared &quot;closed&quot; and the CIA never continued looking into the Finders cult.<br>No one knows why they did what they did, where the evidence went ,etc.<br>All we have are semi-declassified FBI documents. They were only declassified a few years ago and prior to that you could actually find those same documents floating around online.<br>Of course, back then everyone thought they had to be fake.
