For me personally, I can be kinda terrified thinking about what I&#039;d look like, but like honestly even if I still looked kinda clocky and andro and like a twinkhon, I&#039;d be happy enough I think. Basically anything I&#039;ve done to look or feel more fem has been a huge relief to me and just felt right, so like HRT and laser and stuff would probably be awesome.

I&#039;m really scared to actually do anything about it, all I&#039;ve done is tell my partner how I feel once I stopped denying my own feelings, because like it&#039;s lame if I know and admit it to myself and don&#039;t tell them, and talk about it online and write in my diary about it and bounce the idea in my head around a lot. I guess I&#039;ve done other stuff too like shaping my eyebrows more fem, growing my hair out and styling it, trying makeup, shaving body hair, using Halloween as an excuse to dress up fem, stuff like that. I ordered some finasteride from a sketchy online pharmacy and I really considered adding E and bica to my order and I got scared. I keep considering making therapist appointments and stuff too but I keep getting scared of that too. I hate being a man so much that sometimes it makes me want to hurt myself or end myself but still there&#039;s this massive mental barrier there that&#039;s hard to break. I&#039;ll like be trying to voice train and hear how deep my voice is naturally and how much I struggle to sound remotely fem and I just like break down and want to cut myself and cry and I feel terrible and like I&#039;ll never be able to make it work anyways, stuff like that.
