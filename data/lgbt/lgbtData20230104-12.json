I have a decent friend group, but through subtle things they say and do I know I\u2019m a farce or a pretend woman in their eyes. Other tranners tell me they see me as a woman or \u201cnot masc at all\u201d but I remain a head\u2019s height over most of them and twice as large, and I know they\u2019re trying to spare my feelings because they understand how dysphoria feels. Even if I got FFS, I\u2019ve had anons on this board tell me I\u2019d still probably be clocky. I feel bad talking to other trannies about this because I know it would worry them how much I\u2019m considering detransing/acking. How do I feel like a woman despite external stimuli?

I tried piv with my trans gf anyway because she&#039;s tiny, but she got a sudden bought of dysphoria. It was surprising because she used to be almost cringey about wanting to fuck pussy like some posters here. Power to those who do enjoy it, but it&#039;s def not common.

For instance, how they&#039;re the ones who are unfairly treated and how they should be pitied. Why are they here if they love Putin and Z Russia so much? Shouldn&#039;t they fuck off to the frontline and fight for their tsar? Hypocrites.<br>My friends who had to stay in Russia because they had to take care of their elderly parents or just straight up had no money to leave, say that they don&#039;t know how to keep living in that environment even after this bs is over. Like, you&#039;ll know that many of your colleagues, neighbours, etc are actually spiteful Z cowards who, let&#039;s say, called the police on 2 small kids just because they&#039;re dressed in blue and yellow.

Another signature product would have to be lip oils. I love the Dior ones and clarify for just a pop of color and the taste of them . If I ever had a girlfriend I&#039;d want her to taste my lipgloss. The blushes from georgio armani neonude line are amazing texture as well, I love the peach pink color and cool plum.<br>4. Have you tried any new cosmetic products lately and if so, what do you think ablip Gloss. I have tried a cheap lip oil called milani lip oil strawberry melon and it does its job. I actually like it because it isn&#039;t too sticky but the color is a bit too pigmented for my taste so I put only a small amount on my lips.

It\u2019s a storytelling time. I met this qt on Facebook in August and this is the first time when conversation is just flowing naturally and vibe is amazing. I\u2019m thinking, this is it, I\u2019m gonna take it slow, so we\u2019re talking about literally anything, getting to know each other. I\u2019m like, let\u2019s meet up! She agrees. It was a bit awkward cause she\u2019s not that talkative irl, but ok, maybe she\u2019s just shy. So after we met irl, I thought for sure it didn\u2019t went well and she\u2019ll probably end it. But I asked her and she said we\u2019ll meet again. I was happy af. Then we kept texting more, I wanted to met again, but she was busy with moving out. A month or a few passes. I\u2019m asking her if she wants to meet and she\u2019s either busy with her clingy sister (yep, it\u2019s true) or some other bs. Oh, and the conversations are sweet, not too flirty but pretty personal (you know, hearts emojis involved too). Anyway, after a few months she finally agrees to meet again at a concert. It was ok. Idk, it\u2019s like I\u2019m falling for her and I didn\u2019t know if she felt the same way. And Christmas was just around the corner, I knew she\u2019ll be all alone. I asked if we could spend it together so I could finally make my move. She said she\u2019ll tell me later. Time passes, it\u2019s Christmas, I\u2019m asking if she\u2019s down. She says \u201cnah, I\u2019m wanting to be alone and shit\u201d. Well, I kinda got angry coz I could\u2019ve hang out with my friends but it was too late and my mood was ruined lol.

I got really fucking sad over a stupid crush. I deleted the whole conversation and all, yet she kept texting me like the usual. And I asked her why she doesn\u2019t want to date, she just doesn\u2019t that\u2019s all I got. I went deeper coz I got nothing to lose, and obviously it\u2019s because of her previous relationships. Then I remembered she said that she dated a guy who said \u201cI love you\u201d after 2 months and she broke up with him right away. I pointed that out, made some passive aggressive comments too, whatever. We argued and that\u2019s all, it\u2019s not over yet tho. I\u2019m actually glad that bitch got angry, screw her. She already has a horde of dudes simping over her, as she told me, and just random dudes asking for her number and that pisses her off. <br>The whole point of this very long story (sorry), is that, why did she texted me if she wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship or something? And It\u2019s not like she\u2019s looking for casual sex. She just wanted attention? A friend, which she got plenty of? I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m still detoxing from her and I don\u2019t want to be just friends, and obviously, I don\u2019t want to be one of her simps either. Serves me right to fuck with a bisexual girl ikr?

Told me he wouldn&#039;t eat any more, then while I was at work (I was working out of the house while he was working from home) another quarter went missing and when I asked him about it, he said his sister visited and had it.

The reason I think it&#039;s at least a little bit disordered is that he had said to me that he didn&#039;t really like Tuna in sandwiches, and yet he went through all that effort to eat it and hide it from me.
