When he is honest with himself, he also realizes that he never falls in love with men and only feels attracted to men when he is in the midst of an autogynephilic reverie. He has cross-dressed for years and still does at times, but he fi nds that it offers him limited satisfaction: Even wearing sexy women\u2019s attire, he still inhabits his unwanted male body and still has his ugly, embarrassing male genitalia. Falling in love with a woman or having sex with a woman sometimes makes his autogynephilic desires go into remission for a time, but these remissions are always temporary: His autogynephilic feelings always return.

Continuing to live as a man would be the easier, less expensive, and safer option: That way he could keep his job, his reputation, his friends, and perhaps his marriage, if he has one. <br>Continuing to live as a man wouldn\u2019t kill him; he has, after all, done it for years. He could continue to live a life of quiet desperation. But he would still experience significant and often severe gender dysphoria, perhaps every day of his life. Eventually he would become an old man who had never tried to live his dream.

That way, he could at least tell himself that he had tried to live his dream. And, if he were to succeed in some measure, how great would that be? How many people can say that they achieved, in some measure, what they wanted most? If he successfully transitioned, he would finally be playing on the right team, the women\u2019s team; and those awful male genitalia would be gone forever. But he also knows that he would never have a normal life as a woman: He would always be an oddity, albeit perhaps a fascinating or even admirable oddity. And he could easily lose any of the things that currently make his life comfortable and safe: his job, his reputation, his friends, his family. Moreover, the kind of womanhood he could achieve would inevitably be shoddy and inadequate: He would never be able to completely erase the masculinizing effects of testosterone on his body and brain, nor the masculinizing effects of decades of living in society as a man. For an autogynephilic gender dysphoric man to be willing to try to rebuild his life around his paraphilia by pursuing sex reassignment, despite the genuine risks and inevitable limitations involved, he usually needs to be both very brave and very desperate.", "time": 1671193629, "resto": 28778281}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28772572, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)19:09:58", "name": "/Bigen/ - Bisexual General", "com": "Ivy League Edition <br><br>QOTT1: Its bigen university!

Sex is a biological phenomenon, which in itself has been tinged by gender in the case of intersex individuals, considering how it is being characterized (like cliterectomies if an intersex person is afab, is decided based on gender expectations that a woman&#039;s genitals are supposed to look a very specific way with not even a mm of deviancy). That a person with large gametes can carry offspring after being impregnated by a person with small gametes is separate from &quot;zomg it&#039;s a girl, so she can only wear pink, have long hair and has to grow up to be a caretaker and marry amabs&quot; or &quot;zomg it&#039;s a boy, so he can only wear blue, have short hair and has to suppress his emotions and die in a war and marry afabs&quot;. You can&#039;t change your sex really, but gender is a social construct, so you can mess with that as much as you want.

Small sandwich, some tendies, ramen, whatever. Dinner, same thing, just eat something nice.

It blocks dht which is the stronger form of test but dht doesn\u2019t work in muscles so it is purely androgenic, not anabolic. So dht causes masculinization of skin and body fat and other organs besides muscle (where it is deactivated) including organs like the prostate where it is used for bph and cancer. It could shrink the prostate which would suck for bottoming. It causes you to get oily. Dut also blocks not just dht but 5ar which is the enzyme that converts t to dht but it\u2019s responsible for some other things too. It affects alcohol metabolism positively, preventing blackouts and other brain damage. Some guys get depressed and lose their sex drive on dut. It does seem to take away aggression but I\u2019m not sure because there is a period whenever you start or stop where your hormones have to adapt. Eventually it goes back to normal.

B/X is a much more elegant game than 5e. Combat is over in 1-3 rounds and doesn&#039;t have inflated HP totals. The XP system rewards treasure hunting over combat, which synchronizes with the core dungeon crawling gameplay loop instead of wandering through a line of railroaded DM plot points. The game only has 4 human classes and 3 nonhuman races, which is all you need for classic fantasy - a city full of mushroom people isn&#039;t so mystical in 5e when you have warforged astral self monks and psionic tiefing knights at home. That, and you don&#039;t have to make charisma rolls for intimidation or persuasion which means you won&#039;t be foiled by the d20 after actually doing good roleplaying. <br><br>5e doesn&#039;t use 3d6 down the line because you need to roll skill checks for absolutely everything.

Oh no, it&#039;s not mature, it&#039;s commitmentphobic. Please cry me a river. Could probably become a millionaire by specializing in lesbian divorce and the retarded situations they drag themselves in, like when they do IVF and make one get pregnant with a man&#039;s child. It&#039;s all fun and games, so cute, larping as a traditional wholesome Christian couple. Until you break up, divorce and suddenly the one who didn&#039;t carry the child doesn&#039;t actually feel a connection with the kid she couldn&#039;t have even fathered, because biology. Or maybe you do feel a connection, but you&#039;re not getting any rights anyway, because it&#039;s not your genetics. Why would I ever want to get married and do the IVF retardation, when I&#039;ve only ever seen this end in absolute fucking ruin? And nobody fucking learns, nobody has learned from the mistake of older lesbians. They have internalized the need to settle down and have kids way worse than straight women ever have. There are enough straight women who don&#039;t want kids and don&#039;t want to get married. Yet every other lesbian is basically a wannabe tradwife who wants to be permanently barefoot and pregnant and wants to get married to the first woman who looks at her a little funny.
