You can have the same thing though. There&#039;s plenty of women out there who are into femininity or androgyny who go wild for femboys or trans women. I&#039;ve had some girls go rabid for me when they saw me presenting more fem.<br><a href=\"#p29552119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29552119</a><br>Yeah, I think I talked to you about that the other time. The first time I was crossdressing she actually got kinda annoyed and said that my body looks better in a dress than hers does but I think she likes it, like she&#039;s been showing me women&#039;s clothes I might like and stuff and having me try things on. She&#039;s pretty impressed by how fast I got decent at doing makeup too. She hasn&#039;t asked me to go out in public with her like that yet though, but I did do it with costume parties as an excuse. I did tell her that I&#039;ve been considering at least trying HRT to see how it makes me feel and she said she&#039;s totally okay with it and was even saying something like that I should just do it because I seem unhappy a lot of the time. She&#039;s also said she&#039;d stay with me if I transitioned and was talking about our future if I did it. I think I&#039;m pretty lucky with genes too, I&#039;ve mostly been repressing because I&#039;m fucked in the head and I&#039;m also scared of the social repercussions. I do have a few masculine features but they might end up looking okay or i guess I could get FFS if I need it. I almost don&#039;t care anymore though. Between that and her being supporting and how insane I&#039;m being driven by repressing, I feel like it&#039;s inevitable that I&#039;m going to transition. If I don&#039;t do it now I&#039;ll probably be brain fried and snap and transition at like 60 to be a boomerhon so I might as well get it over with.", "time": 1676055201, "resto": 29533922}, {"no": 29552736, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:24:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29552317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29552317</a><br>I wish you luck senpai.
