me because I&#039;m just repeating my internal monologue about my sexual guilt in my gender feelings and I think that my gender feelings are attached to my sexual guilt because when I started feeling attraction to women I started feeling like women are better than men and men are inferior and men are rapists and I clearly and I&#039;m inferior rapist and I&#039;m extra ugly and if I was a woman I would be pretty and then maybe all the woman that left me for lesbians would be into me too and then maybe someone would hug me really close and I would probably orgasm multiple times cuz I heard women that do that. I just want to feel good I just want to have a good time but I know that I&#039;m inherently evil. Because I am male and it&#039;s confirmed by my own sexual thoughts that are constantly sexual toward women and really creepy. Relate to that?

And they have very different physical symptoms.<br>Texanon claims to not know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is legitimately preposterous.<br>We know that Tex has intersex genitalia, meaning that he has a &#039;severe&#039; (for lack of a better word) form of intersexuality. This contrasts with some chromosomal forms of intersexuality which have little to no effect on a person&#039;s body, and can go undiscovered for life. Doctors would have noticed Tex&#039;s genitalia while he was in the womb. With Tex&#039;s parents&#039; permission, doctors would have been able to determine exactly what kind of intersexuality Tex had - if not before birth, then soon after. It is highly likely that Tex&#039;s parents would have given permission for these tests because it is medically important information. Different kinds of intersexuality have a profound effect on the body&#039;s interaction with certain medications, risks of medical conditions, cancers, etc. It is vital for a parent to know these things.<br>But okay. Maybe Tex&#039;s parents didn&#039;t get these tests done, or they did, but they never told Tex the results, leaving him unsure. It doesn&#039;t matter, because Tex has been hospitalised multiple times in his life, including as an independent adult. If Texanon couldn&#039;t tell the doctors what kind of intersexuality he has, they would have tested him immediately upon entry and told him the results. Again, this is vital medical information, like doing a blood test, there&#039;s no way to get around it.<br>(1/2)", "filename": "1601334410505", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 283, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1671679411457923, "time": 1671679411, "md5": "w1nSR8skX9wIXi9OJa2h8g==", "fsize": 27689, "resto": 28853247}, {"no": 28853740, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:24:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28853709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28853709</a><br>at least have the uncropped version", "time": 1671679465, "resto": 28853247}, {"no": 28853741, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:24:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28853738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28853738</a><br>(2/2)<br>Consider also that Tex takes medication, and that prescriptions vary for different sexes. The doctors prescribing his medication? They also need to know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is another case where he would be tested and told his results.<br>But maybe the greatest evidence that Tex is lying isn&#039;t any medical concerns, but simple self-identity. Can you imagine having a condition as major as intersexuality - one which places you apart from 99% of society - and not taking any steps to understand your situation? Living in ignorance about the workings of your own body? Knowing that you are neither male nor female, but not taking any steps to figure out what you are instead? It is ridiculous.<br>There&#039;s no way Texanon is intersex. I would bet money on it.<br>And I think the most interesting question here is: why is he lying? By labelling himself as intersex, Tex has attracted a lot of aggression and ridicule from /gaygen/. Why would someone willingly bring that upon themselves, especially someone like Tex who is so conflict-averse? We know that Texanon has issues with sex - is claiming to be intersex a way of desexualising himself in the gay community? Maybe Texanon is transgender or non-binary and pretending to be intersex gives them gender euphoria. I don&#039;t know.

Prog has been observed to modulate the expression and behavior of estrogen receptors. If I&#039;m remembering correctly, in rabbit models large spikes have been shown to result in a (very) temporary downregulation of estrogen receptors on the surface of breast cells. Our reproductive systems are quite different, but this MAY be an argument in favor of cycling prog, as it also results in a burst of prolactin which makes the tissue more sensitive estrogen after prog levels dip. The best thing to do if you want to maximize breast growth, IMO, is to get all of the growth you can out of just E before staying on prog long term, as everyone&#039;s body will respond differently to it.

The natural state for any physical body is &quot;use it or lose it&quot;. Imagine you&#039;re constantly losing a small percentage of your strength every day. Normal activity, like walking down the hall and taking out the trash causes you to build a very small amount of strength. Working out does a lot more. If you did nothing but lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the loss would stack up quickly and you&#039;d notice it after a few days. Just doing that little bit of housework helps to counteract this a lot. Testosterone made it so the rate that you lose strength at was low. Without male levels of T, the rate you lose strength at will be a lot higher, so you need to do more just to counteract the loss and even more to bulk.

However, both heterosexual males and homosexual females have slightly asymmetrical brains, with the right hemisphere being 1-2% larger on the left. There are similar results for patterns of brain activity. For example, parts of the brain involved in reward and emotion are more strongly activated when heterosexual males and homosexual females women look at female faces, and when heterosexual females and homosexual males see male faces. The same patterns apply when people smell chemicals that probably act as human pheromones. Brain-scanning techniques like PET can measure the flow of blood into the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in processing emotions. These visuals reveal the connections that link the amygdala to other parts of the brain. The amygdalas of homosexual males also have more in common with those of heterosexual females \u2013 the two halves are well-connected.

These work on both PC and phone with the same account and access to message history. Signal needs a phone number to work, and element only needs an email and password.<br>Both have character limits though, which can be a problem if your entries start getting very long (which they will after a while, since you&#039;re expressing, at the least, entire years in all their detail into text), and some people don&#039;t like the chatroom format for journals at all. If that&#039;s a problem, skiff is also good as an encrypted version of google docs and you can write as much as you want and format it however you like. This also works on anything with a web browser, and has a mobile app.<br><br>As my journal gets longer and more detailed, I&#039;ve found that using a chat for quickly writing down things, where ever I happen to be, as I remember them is best, and then consolidating things into a timeline on a proper document works for me. The chatroom format can get a bit unwieldy when you have hundreds of various entries, all hundreds to thousands of words long and jumping to different ages and eras all the time.<br><br>Good luck to anyone who takes on journaling as a healing practice. It can be very intense and you may need a hug or other support as you process everything that&#039;s happened to you. Don&#039;t be afraid to reach out to a friend or family member if you have one you trust or can rely on, or you can post online somewhere.<br><br><a href=\"#p28854147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28854147</a><br>It&#039;s important to remember that you picked up a habit for a reason, and that substance use isn&#039;t a inherently evil thing.

available. he messaged me back saying he was getting home late so i had to stay up until like 3 am, i kinda dozed off while waiting. he eventually got back and told me to meet him in the laundry room of the apt complex, so i hung out there until he showed up. he seemed superrr grateful and excited about the gift which made me happy. i was also dolled up with makeup and tights and stuff lol. anyways, we went back to our rooms and he wanted to call me on the phone. we chatted for a bit and he said we should meet so he could give me a thank you hug. he didn\u2019t want us to be seen going in/out of each others places so he suggested we meet at a nearby parking lot. i drove over there to meet him and we hugged and he was giving me lots of nice complements. before we parted ways i asked if he wanted to cuddle and he did, so we got into the back seat of my car and started getting intimate. i got laid out on my back as he dry humped me against my panties. i really wanted us to go further but apparently it was too soon for him to want to penetrate. instead he said he wanted me to cum so i pulled out my pp and started stroking while being provoked into saying what a good girl i am for daddy. i had my orgasm and then he continued humping me until he got off too. we drove back after that and i went to bed. he messaged me a bit this morning wanting to see some pics so i shared a couple lewd images of myself. then a little while later he mentioned how it wasn\u2019t a good idea for us to meet in secret as his work commitments were too important. anyways, we have been friendly and understanding about it since and i doubt anything more is going to happen. so he\u2019s back to just being my property manager except now he\u2019s seen me naked and has some holiday

Same thing with anime girl-boys like Bridget. Then several btard trannies and crossdressers started getting a lot of attention, linetrap being the most known of course, by the time I came to the board people were earnestly fapping in trap threads daily. Back then gender issues weren&#039;t in the zeitgeist so no one really differentiated between trans girls and crossdressers, it was just about having a dick but looking like a girl.

I was hanging out with these girls who are trying to sell me drugs and they did end up giving me some DMT which was pretty good and fun. I saw rainbows and felt happy. That&#039;s also an illegal drug and I&#039;m also mentally ill. Does that make me a bad person? I also hit it out of her meth pipe so maybe I got slightly high off of some meth residue or some shit who cares? She was really nervous about me judging her for doing math. I told her I didn&#039;t mind. I mean, her room was a mess and full of stolen makeup and shit. Who cares? She&#039;s only stealing from big corporations. It&#039;s her room. It&#039;s not my problem. And it&#039;s not for me to judge other people. It&#039;s also just a drug like. I know meth has a bad reputation but it&#039;s literally prescribed to some kids with ADHD. Meth mouth is just from not sleeping and not brushing your teeth. The effects of the drug really depend on the dosage and how you use it. Sometimes I smoke ciggies. Those are bad for you too and can also make you look ugly if you smoke them for too long. They can age your skin and shit. I&#039;m already ugly anyway and I feel bad. Life hurts. So I just want to feel good. Life&#039;s a bitch and then you die. That&#039;s why we get high. I also drink alcohol and smoke weed. Some people it&#039;s socially acceptable and I think those people who are okay with breaking laws or doing drugs are cool. Like if you judge people just for doing drugs that&#039;s just not cool. I mean yeah the meth isn&#039;t good for you but I don&#039;t think people can just choose to like suddenly not be mentally ill and just stop using meth I don&#039;t know.

But as she reached her thirties, she found herself longing for more. She had grown tired of the constant fighting and looting, and yearned for a sense of purpose and direction. One day, as Irina was sailing on her ship, &quot;Midnight,&quot; she was approached by aliens from a distant planet. These aliens, who called themselves the Voraxians, explained that they had been watching Irina for some time and had been impressed by her leadership skills and her ability to think on her feet. They offered Irina the opportunity to lead a fleet of space pirates on their behalf, and Irina, feeling a sense of excitement and adventure stirring within her once again, agreed. The Voraxians introduced Irina to Ambyr, a prodigy who would be her second-in-command. Ambyr had been trained in the art of telepathy and other psychic abilities, and was eager to put her skills to use in the world of space piracy. Together, Irina and Ambyr set off on their first mission, leading a team of skilled space pirates on a mission to steal valuable cargo from a rival alien race. They encountered all manner of challenges and dangers along the way, but with Irina&#039;s leadership and Ambyr&#039;s psychic powers, they were able to overcome them. As they explored the galaxy, Irina and Ambyr discovered new alien races and encountered all manner of strange and wondrous sights. They also found that their bond had grown deep, and they became like family to one another. Even though they had been taken by aliens and forced into a life of space piracy, Irina and Ambyr couldn&#039;t be happier. They had found a new sense of purpose and direction, and they lived happily ever after, exploring the galaxy and leading their fleet of space pirates to victory.", "filename": "maybe shake a tambourine", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671706600275081, "time": 1671706600, "md5": "jlmGi6wn3vmZk2uSlmU6FA==", "fsize": 1639581, "resto": 28855214, "trip": "!!+M+mjbL3cxD"}, {"no": 28857370, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)05:57:38", "name": "Male Chauvinist", "com": "Women only want men for many women only want men for the favors and for the status and to have money and to have a guy with a car and have a guy who&#039;s strong and can protect them but I can&#039;t do any of those things and I want a woman to love me for who I am inside but who I&#039;m inside is a really bad person I&#039;m actually really bad person because I kissed a girl on the lips in high school but I think maybe she was a sleep or something or maybe she was too drunk and I kissed her on the lips and didn&#039;t put my tongue in on anything I didn&#039;t mean to hurt her but I know that I did I know that I did hurt her and I do feel guilty but it&#039;s not like I changed I just laugh I just laugh and I can&#039;t stop laughing because it&#039;s just funny to me because I have no feelings inside because I have no regrets and I mean it hurts and I mean I do regret it I mean I do feel bad but I don&#039;t really feel bad in a normal way I just laugh and I laugh and I laugh<br><a href=\"#p28857336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28857336</a><br>Let me suck you off daddy<br><a href=\"#p28857210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28857210</a><br>I am not any of the ppl you guessing.

People around town started to talk, one of our friends came by to talk to dad and looked at me with disgust and said &quot;so was it this hard to have just gotten a girlfriend? Do you like guys now?&quot; Shit cut deep, the guy used to brag about me to everyone, I was a hot shit stunt man.

One day she posted a picture of them at the beach. I stared at her in her bikini for only a second or two before my eyes wandered over to her boyfriend and my jaw dropped. He had a perfectly sculpted manly body. For the first time, I felt myself start to get an erection while looking at a picture of her Chad boyfriend.
