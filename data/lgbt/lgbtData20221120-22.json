I have only a cursory knowledge of ferrets. But I will tell you everything I know, even if it&#039;s conjecture. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They really like sleeves</span><br>I guess it&#039;s cause they&#039;re long like sleeves are. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They can jump</span><br>They&#039;re really long so these jumps are not very impressive. But they&#039;re impressive to me<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They like ferret oil</span><br>I have no idea what this oil is made of or why they covet it so. But if you need to calm them down you just put a little dab of ferret oil on their long little tummies and they&#039;ll bend around and start licking it off, while they&#039;re preoccupied you can put them in a little cloth hammock and they will go right to sleep curled up like a little pretzel. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can take them for walks with little harnesses</span><br>I think they enjoy this. They seem very well behaved. <br> Alright that wraps up everything I know about ferrets.

Those same people tend to wear knee-length or longer shorts, as opposed to several inches above like I do. <br>Do shorts like this actually give off a gay vibe, or is it just the people in my area that think so? I&#039;d like to point out, that even though these shorts are short, they&#039;re still way longer than typical women&#039;s shorts. Hence why I attached the photo of the woman as well, to show that though his shorts are short, they&#039;re still way longer than hers. His are probably like a 5 or 7 inch inseam, hers are like a 3 inch inseam at best. <br>For the record, I am bisexual, so I don&#039;t 100% mind if I give off a bit of a gay vibe...but I still prefer women a lot, so it&#039;s probably best if I don&#039;t, lol.", "filename": "MenWomenShorts", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2926, "h": 2193, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1668991850175350, "time": 1668991850, "md5": "PiwbMW89K0kj7n+/w2R+ag==", "fsize": 1219029, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "do-mens-shorts-that-go-several-inches-above-the", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 9, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 28434391, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)20:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28433800</span><br>lmao they deleted it, what a shame", "time": 1668994890, "resto": 28433774}, {"no": 28434470, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)20:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28433774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28433774</a><br>five is fine. another shorter is gay anything longer you look like your dad", "time": 1668995267, "resto": 28433774}, {"no": 28434602, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)20:56:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28433774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28433774</a><br>Hell nah I always rock ranger panties I need to get my tranner a matching pair", "time": 1668995806, "resto": 28433774}, {"no": 28434658, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:01:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28433774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28433774</a><br>We&#039;re going to need a pic ofyou in cut offs, just standard procedure I&#039;m afraid", "time": 1668996083, "resto": 28433774}, {"no": 28434827, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:16:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Short shorts are trendy among jocks and frat bros now, most of whom would never even consider dating a man (be real).", "time": 1668996967, "resto": 28433774}], "last_modified": 1668996967}, {"no": 28434826, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:16:07", "name": "aroace", "sub": "/ace/aro/gen/", "com": "asexual/aromanitc general<br>previous one: <a href=\"/lgbt/thread/28411830#p28411830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28411830</a><br>QOTD: do you like the colours green &amp; purple?<br>Links:<br>A.V.E.N.(the Asexual Visibility &amp; Education Network) - www.asexuality.org<br>A.U.R.E.A.(Aromantic-spectrum Union for Recognition, Education, &amp; Advocacy) - www.aromanticism.org<br>Q&amp;A/FAQ:<br>what is asexuality?<br>it&#039;s where one feels little to no sexual attraction.<br>is asexuality celibacy?<br>No, celibacy is abstaining from sex &amp; is an individual choice unlike asexuality.<br>what is aromanticism?<br>Aromanticism is where one feels little to no romantic attraction.<br>Is aromanticism a sexuality?<br>No, it&#039;s a romantic orientation.", "filename": "aro &amp; ace hat", "ext": ".png", "w": 639, "h": 635, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1668996967741236, "time": 1668996967, "md5": "O1kKdUQ58GSbc7dHc/PaKg==", "fsize": 230004, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "acearogen", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1668996967}, {"no": 28433367, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)19:10:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish I had friends and wasn&#039;t an autistic retard.
