But lesbians since our kinda sex hardly counts as real sex we skip so much of the risk. Not having penis means people dont think lesbian sex as real sex but as a plus no dirty penis to jab stds into any orifices means less std rates among lesbians.<br><br>Of course immune system and environment have huge factors to play too.

Its not that gay men are more likely to have STDs cause theyre more deviant and less promiscuous. Its more that anal sex in itself increases chances compared to vaginal sex (due to risk of anal tearing and anal walls not having as much immune defense like vagina do) and combined with the fact that most gays saw condoms as a hetbreeder thing. So gay dudes have more anal sex than hets. Thats all.

B/X is a much more elegant game than 5e. Combat is over in 1-3 rounds and doesn&#039;t have inflated HP totals. The XP system rewards treasure hunting over combat, which synchronizes with the core dungeon crawling gameplay loop instead of wandering through a line of railroaded DM plot points. The game only has 4 human classes and 3 nonhuman races, which is all you need for classic fantasy - a city full of mushroom people isn&#039;t so mystical in 5e when you have warforged astral self monks and psionic tiefing knights at home. That, and you don&#039;t have to make charisma rolls for intimidation or persuasion which means you won&#039;t be foiled by the d20 after actually doing good roleplaying. <br><br>5e doesn&#039;t use 3d6 down the line because you need to roll skill checks for absolutely everything. Player skill is much more important in OSR.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it makes for a different D&amp;D game one which modern rules and modern players just aren&#039;t built for. </span><br>I mean, it definitely makes for a different game. 5e has almost no mechanics for exploration at all, and the ones that exist are almost unplayable RAW. Personally I find dungeon crawling much more engaging when light isn&#039;t just an unlimited cantrip and your torch is a fragile safeguard between the party and a darkness full of monsters, but that&#039;s me, and I&#039;m not exactly an old gamer who was around when this stuff was current.", "filename": "unknown-20", "ext": ".png", "w": 576, "h": 432, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670883265791464, "time": 1670883265, "md5": "X1SsKo/T+eh3fQw7rq8eug==", "fsize": 390689, "resto": 28689926}, {"no": 28730309, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:35:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28729295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28729295</a><br>You a collector of some kind?", "time": 1670888109, "resto": 28689926}, {"no": 28730436, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28689926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28689926</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A/S/L</span><br>41/Male/North Dakota<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sexuality</span><br>Straight<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;About me</span><br>Passoid supremacist and srs advocate, by force.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hobbies/interests</span><br>I look young and i&#039;d like to meet trad trans people, not neccesarily for anything special i just have a type of humor that offends a lot of users of this board.
