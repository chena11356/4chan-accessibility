I&#039;m one of those people honestly too though lol. It&#039;s hard to get the strength to do it even when being a man sometimes makes me want to off myself, there&#039;s just so much mental struggle with it even after I&#039;ve been spending the last year trying to process and work through everything and decide if I want to move in that direction and doing stuff besides HRT to look or feel more fem. Like, I&#039;m basically sure this is never going to go away on its own even though I want it to, like I&#039;ve wanted to be a girl even when I was a little kid, and just repressing feels like it&#039;s sending my life into a slow tail spin where the toll on my mental health is making me feel like I&#039;m going to lose everything eventually, and there&#039;s already been a few signs of things in my life starting to crack at the seams from how I&#039;ve been. My first impulse when I think of myself as a 45 year old man is to want to kill myself, but I feel very happy and content when I imagine being a woman in the future instead. Even still, it&#039;s so hard to just order the HRT. I freak out about everything that could possibly go wrong, worry about what if I&#039;m a hon, what if I lose my job, what if my partner leaves me, what if everyone laughs at me, what if my family ridicules me and disowns me, what if I somehow regret it, worry about surgeries... I know like logically that I probably just need to transition or I&#039;ll end up going more crazy and fucking my life up and probably end up offing myself, but like at the same time I&#039;m so scared and there&#039;s like some lingering doubt I can&#039;t get rid of. It&#039;s a mental nightmare that I really want out of that&#039;s making most of my time very unenjoyable. I like hope that someone is already secretly dosing me with HRT or that I ordered it another day and forgot and it&#039;s coming soon but I still can&#039;t order it. I really hope some day soon I get the strength and just press the confirm order button because once I have it I know I&#039;m going to take it.", "time": 1670743800, "resto": 28704830}, {"no": 28708361, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)02:44:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28707735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28707735</a><br>it was a part time job paying non-adult minimum wage while I was still in school", "time": 1670744685, "resto": 28704830}, {"no": 28708890, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:48:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28704830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28704830</a><br>I was desperately searching for any way to feminize myself at 12 years old but nothing turned up, didn&#039;t know about hrt and was too much of a coward to do anything drastic like that<br>repped to 21 then started HRT but it was beyond over and family destroyed it anyway<br>probably gonna end up roping or go down the self-destruction path until i wind up dead one way or another", "time": 1670748520, "resto": 28704830}, {"no": 28708953, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:59:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28706788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28706788</a><br>I repped until I was 22 but I was already just as fucked when I was 18, and I wouldn&#039;t have been able to get a decent job back then.
