How does the trans-positive movement reward its supporters?<br><br>It seems to me that it doesn&#039;t. It seems like the movement expects total conformity without a single positive incentive. I will admit that the movement punishes apostates with the fury of a sysadmin scorned. They can fuck up your web shit.<br><br>But contrast this with what the trans-exclusionary movement gives normal supporters: book deals, speaking engagements, and for the layperson some communities like mumsnet.

My point being, the movement isn&#039;t really expanding its base OR hurting its enemies.<br><br>The real threat to the trans-positive movement is complacency. Complacency gets cis people everything they want. It is exactly as rewarding as trans-positivity but bears no risk of being a hated apostate. A complacent person can always just plead ignorance if you say something like &quot;non binary doesn&#039;t make sense.&quot; And most importantly, a complacent person gets to opt out of all of the demands that the trans-positive movement makes for attention, influence, power.

I made a massive ass of myself and have no solid memories besides triggering a panic attack and getting slapped out of it, then breaking out in tears. It&#039;s been really really awkward at work and I don&#039;t have any idea what actually happened. It was 5 6ft or larger guys, two severely obese women, me 5&#039;4&quot; stocky with muscle from physical labor, and my extra tiny 5&#039;1&quot; friend visiting from Utah (she had a great time apparently). <br><br>1/2", "time": 1672961559, "resto": 29029155}, {"no": 29060703, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)18:33:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29060682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29060682</a><br>I&#039;ve been having a real rough time, drinking way way too much and getting mopey. So apparently I black out and get mopey and cry about being inadequate at work, lacking confidence. Then things get better and apparently I challenged one of the guys to wrestle??? I can&#039;t imagine I lasted long or did anything worthwhile. He&#039;s a long skinny man from rural Missouri there was no way I&#039;d be able to get a single hold in. I don&#039;t know why I would do this. It&#039;s somewhat in character but I honestly have no memory of this. I just know for a fact I got my ass kicked. I have a very vague memory of offering him 20 dollars from my wallet &quot;to forget this&quot;. I&#039;m normally afraid of being touched by big guys so I&#039;m really confused how that happened. <br><br>As for what caused me to go into a panic attack, bite some bruises on my wrist, and apparently put a couple good nail marks on my shoulders? What did I do? It makes sense I&#039;d get slapped out of that. Or if I said something really dumb. I tend to just compliment people, or attempt to, when really drunk so I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d say. <br><br>Overall I&#039;m still very confused. I feel very deep shame and even some fear when I see my coworkers. I feel like I did something very very bad but my friend, who didn&#039;t see me get slapped or the lead up to it, didn&#039;t seem to think I did anything that bad. But the guys at work can&#039;t look me in the eye and things are weird. I&#039;m working perfectly fine with 2 of the guys but two others are avoiding me entirely while another looks like I kicked him when my face contorts due to intense feelings of humiliation. I must have said or done something very bad.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy. Similar results were noted by Burns et al. (1981) in girls with hypopituitarism due to craniopharyngioma.</span><br>These findings indicate that gonadotrophins are indispensable for the effectiveaction of oestrogen on breast development. It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH.&quot;<br>there are gonadotropin receptors in breasts, today also saw something about gonadotropins + estrogen affecting breast cancer different than estrogen alone, but i want to sleep now", "time": 1672974195, "resto": 29055654}, {"no": 29063396, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)22:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29060933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29060933</a><br>Depends but usually spiro", "time": 1672974655, "resto": 29055654}, {"no": 29064551, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:20:16", "name": "Anonmous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29063316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29063316</a><br>this is very interesting, thanks for sharing<br>had no idea about gonodatropins link to breast growth", "time": 1672982416, "resto": 29055654}, {"no": 29064947, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:54:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29055654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29055654</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;start injecting een around two years ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Immediately get clear skin, breasts grow very fast</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fast forward to 4 months ago, acne starts to come back, breasts stop growing after the first year.

Its difficult enough to enforce boundaries with parents like yours, it can be impossible to do if you interact with less shitty family that arent ready to enforce similar boundaries especially siblings. For example say your lil sister wants a full family dinner for her birthday. Then your parents come over and double down on treating you like shit and start guilting you for abandoning family and get back on their petty homophobia bullshit and start acting like you owe them something. What are you gonna do then? Fuck up your sisters birthday? Or roll over for your family just to maintain their illusions again?<br><br>Better to be proactively a bitch than reactively. So if you do allow your less fucked up siblings stay with you set some clear rules with them. Explain you have no intention of repeating the bullshit your parents do. That you are trying to be better. Because you DO think you have the potential to be better than them. And you know that potential exists in your siblings.

I still remember those long summer days spent stoned, rolling around in the sheets, pausing only to eat before being magnetically drawn back to one another&#039;s bodies.

Regardless, only ~0.1% have persistent sexual side effects after discontinuing finasteride as the other anon mentioned. The study is selecting people from this 0.1% as part of the finasteride group. It&#039;s clear that the depression isn&#039;t directly caused by the finasteride itself, it&#039;s caused by erectile dysfunction in general, but in this particular study they selected only finasteride-induced ED patients. What&#039;s really interesting to me is that 36% of the finasteride group were ok with erectile dysfunction! Anyway, topically applied DHT blockers are still effective at preventing hair loss with virtually no side effects. So do that instead if you&#039;re worried. Even if you choose to take it orally, many cis men are willing to take the risk of &lt;0.1% chance of persistent erectile dysfunction (which may not even be permanent in the first place) over 100% chance of baldness.

It becomes a &#039;broken&#039; brain. Obviously there&#039;s people out there who can be considered difficult to handle, like a very aggressive person, but that doesn&#039;t inherently mean they have a mental illness. Maybe just a bad upbringing or a low intelligence. Anyway, a mental illness happens *alongside* the person in the brain, it happens alongside the consciousness or the &#039;you&#039; in the brain. That&#039;s why all of these things make a mental illness. The person being subjected to the brain doing unwanted things had no control over them.<br><br>If you think about transgenderism as a &#039;mental&#039; problem, it becomes much easier to deal with it. It&#039;s a brain that thinks and expects to be in a certain kind of body, but actually isn&#039;t. Instead of dealing with transgenderism as a mental problem we assume the person being dysphoric (I switched to this term now, because then it&#039;s more easily seen as a mental illness) is right in their belief of what they are. We don&#039;t believe a schizo in their ramblings, so why a dysphoric person?

If you&#039;re female you wouldn&#039;t really take that as a replacement for a penis. It&#039;s impossible for a male body to become female and vice versa.

Obviously, there are now more FtM transitioners, but they also tend to detransition and then go full TERF. I believe that being a true FtM transgender is actually quite rare, there are some who have obviously been like that since childhood but most are not like this. <br><br>While MtFs tend to repress more, the autogynephilic desire to become a woman among AMABs seems to be a very common. FtMs don&#039;t really seem to want to become men, but they just want to stop being women.
