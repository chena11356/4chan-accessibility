And I was getting pain when breathing and wasn&#039;t able to bind so I bit the bullet and got surgery a few weeks ago. <br>I have no sensation in my chest but I already don&#039;t regret anything because I love the way I look. My body is exactly what I want and it makes me really happy. I&#039;ll adjust sexually to whatever. Sex is different now but it&#039;s fine and I&#039;ll figure out other ways to enjoy my body. People will no genitals can still find ways to orgasm through touching their ears and other stuff so if you think you need surgery don&#039;t be scared to get it.<br>But there&#039;s also no rush. If you want to wait and see then that&#039;s okay, whenever you&#039;re ready. And if you decide you never want surgery then that&#039;s okay too.<br><a href=\"#p29637993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29637993</a><br>If you&#039;re not super big then some nipple stalk preserving methods like t anchor and buttonhole exist. Not an option for everyone because some are too big for even that but you might wanna get a couple consults just to see your options. Surgeons told me if I did it then I would still have a lot of extra breast tissue and my surgeon low-key pressured me into getting regular double incision and I&#039;m happy with it.<br>My body makes me so happy now. Sometimes I&#039;ll get nitpicky about how my hips dig into my mattress more than an average cis man&#039;s would but honestly this is just great.<br><a href=\"#p29638002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29638002</a><br>You&#039;re welcome to try", "time": 1676548702, "resto": 29635858, "trip": "!!J7fvg/OBnsn"}, {"no": 29638056, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:58:41", "name": "tranny hater", "com": "<a href=\"#p29638039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29638039</a><br>I don&#039;t my liddle afab softboi", "time": 1676548721, "resto": 29635858}, {"no": 29638058, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:59:25", "name": "ArabMan", "com": "<a href=\"#p29638043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29638043</a><br>No being mean to Electra, bad anon", "time": 1676548765, "resto": 29635858, "trip": "!!J7fvg/OBnsn"}, {"no": 29638062, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:59:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29638056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29638056</a><br>Then why are you so fucking retarded?", "time": 1676548793, "resto": 29635858}, {"no": 29638075, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:03:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019m appalled that Nazi Leaf wants to be in a relationship with Tranny Hater, if that were me I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself.

So I was messaging him and he seemed to be into it and so I pretended that I was scrolling Grindr and found another guy while we were messaging. And I told him that I had a &quot;real man&quot; coming over and blah blah I played it up, you know. Well after a bit of messaging I told him that the other guy was here, then I went and fucked up my makeup and made my eyes watery. About a half hour later I sent him that photo saying that the other guy took it for him and then left. It was kinda a fun rp and the guy seemed really really into it. Normally I&#039;m like 100% submissive so it&#039;s out of my wheelhouse but it was kinda a fun experience. So no that wasn&#039;t a real bj pic, sorry to burst anyone&#039;s bubble.

will might be very cringe n very long n manic but whatever its valentines day and im a sad single wreck and i want to whine about this..<br>so basically i can&#039;t really get off unless i read smut or use my imagination. problem is because i&#039;ve never had sex before i always picture my first time when im trying to get off which doesn&#039;t really sound like a problem but i have to picture all the lead up as well. so usually it&#039;s established that me and a guy have been talking a while maybe he&#039;s already my bf, maybe he&#039;ll eventually become one, but yeah that&#039;s established and we&#039;re either going to his after a date or we&#039;re having a date at his and he stops and turns and asks to kiss me. we attempt kissing and its very awkward because i have no clue what im doing so we laugh about it for a bit but then it continues and we&#039;re like actually making out until i push i him away because i always imagine myself suddenly getting really dysphoric. he typically then holds me for a bit and because idk how sex is usually initiated it skips forward to him starting to get undressed while i sit there still feeling dysphoric. he comes over to me and tell me im being stupid n starts helping me get undressed, saying stuff like &quot;anonette you&#039;re body is so pretty u shouldn&#039;t hide it&quot; or something similar. he holds me while im naked for a bit then we starts kissing again n i can feel his dick against my own or my stomach or something and for a second it feels like my dysphoria is gone entirely. then typically after we stop kissing he plays with my dick a bit n that&#039;s when i start to tear up in the fantasy and irl. when it gets to point he&#039;s topping me i am straight up crying in my fantasy from a mix of dysphoria and the fact i never thought a guy would love me enough to fuck me. and usually it ends there and i just lie in my bed very down very sad maybe there&#039;s a couple tears but i felt so lonely today i just started bawling my eyes out. im sry for posting this anons is it srsly over for me?", "filename": "phno", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim":
