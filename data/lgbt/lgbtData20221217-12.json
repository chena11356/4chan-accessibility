It makes sense; if you could be having sex right now you wouldn\u2019t be posting here. And a lot of people don\u2019t have partners, hence the inevitable \u201cno big dick gf\u201d remark.<br><br>Most here know ways to take their masturbating beyond a quick 30 seconds of jerking off: toys, chatting, dressing up, and so on. This is equivalent to foreplay or kinky stuff during sex. <br><br>I recently discovered another way that\u2019s never mentioned. I visited a sex shop and bought a dildo. It\u2019s thrilling for a few reasons. <br><br>First is the excitement of a new toy. Yes, you can buy a big rubber dick on Amazon, but you really don\u2019t know how big it is or if it\u2019s really appealing until you see it in person. Picking one out that you can see is obviously better.<br><br>Beyond that, there\u2019s the naughtiness. You know you shouldn\u2019t be in there. Only perverts go in there. But there you are, pulling into the parking lot.<br><br>There\u2019s also an exciting type of embarrassment, a sort of public shaming that\u2019s actually a turn on.

Any answer but &quot;youre doomed there&#039;s no hope&quot; wont satisfy you, because youre not looking for a real answer. You&#039;re looking for an excuse to justify your complacency.<br>If you wanna be complacent, go for it, but don&#039;t try and pawn it off as the world being over for you because you screwed up 20 years ago. Lots of people get married in their 40s and are perfectly happy. If you can&#039;t find anyone you&#039;re interested in, welcome to the club. Most people have a hard time finding someone they like, and most settle or go along with the first real relationship they&#039;ve started.<br>Come on, of all the people you&#039;ve seen together, how many were happy? Like, truly happy and in love? Probably most, but definitely not a supermajority. <br>Holding onto this idea of &quot;true love&quot; is only holding you back and justifying retarded thought processes. Life isnt a fuckin disney movie, and true love doesnt exist. There&#039;s infatuation, which is what you feel early in a relationship and when youre young. If youre super lucky, that lasts a year. Then you develop into a long-term relationship, where you mutually care for and appreciate eachother in a more relaxed fashion. There&#039;s a reason married couples don&#039;t go to disneyworld every 2 months once they hit 40.<br>Also, it&#039;s not &quot;sad&quot; to date whoever youre interested in. Like I said before, most people settle or find people that are relatively interesting or attractive or whatever. You dont gotta do that, and you dont have to date at all, if you dont find someone youre interested in.<br>Dear god man, get your head out the sand and stop listening to people who tell you shit like this. Not only is it almost objectively wrong, not only is awful for your mental health, but it&#039;s genuinely a fucking retarded worldview.<br><br>Like I said, if you want an excuse to give up on love, you wont get it from me.

Referring to them as &quot;ant-people&quot; sounds a bit derogatory, depending on your cultural background, though. I remember reading the biography of a Navajo Code Talker (a native american enlisted to use the Navajo language for secret communication during WWII).

You could leave a lot of humanity&#039;s records as being lost, which would also explain why certain technologies appear to be abandoned or forgotten; no one knows how to make or operate it anymore. <br>That said, from my loose understanding of meteorology, it sounds like the Earth&#039;s atmosphere has thinned dramatically. So there&#039;s a much greater level of UV exposure across the planet, more heat going into the oceans, and that drives increased evaporation worldwide.We already had a scare with chlorofluorocarbons, and if we didn&#039;t learn our lesson from those, it&#039;s not much of a stretch to say that we would have ravaged our planet&#039;s protections. <br><br>Peyote is absolutely a great choice for a recreational drug though, and it definitely makes sense to have it as THE drug of choice.

I didn&#039;t really have anything set out other than general pollution and industry. I don&#039;t want to make a bunch of fantasy stuff and magic in the setting, but i&#039;m a little less worried about if the setting requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit in order to actually be created in the first place.<br>Either way, it&#039;s still cool it&#039;s hypothetically possible.<br>Thanks for the peyote thing. Some people tell me it seems excessive or they &quot;dont like the drugs thing&quot;, but I think that speaks less to the work itself<br>As for rice, I don&#039;t see a reason it COULDNT be in setups. I mean the specific crops are gonna vary by location and whatnot, but rice seems reasonable.<br>Geothermal energy seems reasonable, and probably would benefit due to their structure. The main thing is that the benefit is too low and the cost wayy too high. Electricity is useful in their world, but not really the way it is in ours. They&#039;re not stupid in this setting, but stuff like telephones would be hard to invent, and would also be kindof useless to most people.<br> Even if they had 24/7 electricity, the extent of the use would probably be limited to motors and lightbulbs, maybe a proto-telegraph like thing if they were really ingenuitive. That&#039;s a huge advantage, don&#039;t get me wrong, but even if they could build any kind of generator, the staffing would be radically expensive, and the vast majority, if not all cities wouldn&#039;t need it enough to warrant the cost, and that&#039;s assuming they COULD build a generator (which im honestly not sure enough about the mechanics to say definitively).", "time": 1671270399, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!!fiWEOioQbt6"}, {"no": 28790645, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)05:22:56", "name": "Wuming", "com": "gmgm", "filename": "IMG_20221216_080944_818", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 1205, "tn_w": 121, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671272576377859, "time": 1671272576, "md5": "Amv9hOYSBQTuder2YUdzSQ==", "fsize": 120926, "resto": 28772572}, {"no": 28790646, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)05:23:07", "name": "Baka", "com": "Good almost noon everyone", "filename": "Screenshot_20221110-215754_Gallery", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 792, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1671272587854435, "time": 1671272587, "md5": "Kbd8lUM2e795TyZM7ye93w==", "fsize": 321676, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!GNrGHxOKPI"}, {"no": 28790788, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)05:55:22", "name": "SemiLongHairAnon", "com": "Morning everyone<br><br><a href=\"#p28790645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790645</a><br><a href=\"#p28790646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790646</a><br>Morning", "filename": "Morning", "ext": ".png", "w": 274, "h": 359, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671274522411448, "time": 1671274522, "md5": "Vplcs9MgJs0ipkfNS+pVNw==", "fsize": 120857, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!!m2FCb6RjFD6"}, {"no": 28790848, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:02:29", "name": "Wuming", "com": "<a href=\"#p28790788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790788</a><br><a href=\"#p28790646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790646</a><br>gmgm ^^", "filename": "1670964992483412", "ext": ".png", "w": 707, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1671274949287121, "time": 1671274949, "md5": "l3nDlJ/LdRRbX2k8G/YEFA==", "fsize": 585946, "resto": 28772572}, {"no": 28790931, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:18:56", "name": "Baka", "com": "<a href=\"#p28790788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790788</a><br><a href=\"#p28790848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790848</a><br>Mornin mornin", "filename": "Screenshot_20221008-200431_Brave", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 838, "h": 711, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671275936853604, "time": 1671275936, "md5": "/GuoJUmqx/JGScTW7fF1rQ==", "fsize": 182920, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!GNrGHxOKPI"}, {"no": 28790966, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:29:32", "name": "Baka", "com": "The theory was confirmed<br>I have 2 cm circumf larget tiddie measurements than last time i checked which was like october i think<br>Je suis content\u00e9", "time": 1671276572, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!GNrGHxOKPI"}, {"no": 28790968, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:29:57", "name": "Layrinn", "com": "<a href=\"#p28790788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790788</a><br><a href=\"#p28790848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790848</a><br><a href=\"#p28790931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790931</a><br>Why the hell am I awake at this hour.", "filename": "1635758458627", "ext": ".png", "w": 840, "h": 1320, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671276597532122, "time": 1671276597, "md5": "i/0hftJ4MAUtsERyqscpmw==", "fsize": 1420541, "resto": 28772572, "trip": "!!U2MZUEkRct+"}, {"no": 28790984, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)06:33:10", "name": "SemiLongHairAnon", "com": "<a href=\"#p28790848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790848</a><br><a href=\"#p28790931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28790931</a><br>How&#039;s it going?

I&#039;ve known I wanted to be a woman instead for my entirely life, ans I&#039;ve also had the hots for men, but a lot of the time, internalized transphobia has kept me from admitting I was trans, and internalized homophobia kept me from admitting that I&#039;m attracted to men.

It feels almost like I&#039;m trapped in limbo and that both transitioning and not transitioning are scary options but for different reasons. Another major thing that&#039;s bothering me a lot is the dysphoria itself. I&#039;ll constantly be bothered by the little things and daydreaming that it could be different and that I&#039;m not a man, and sometimes it gets acute and strong and I feel extremely intense disgust with my body and feel hopeless and I want to die. I have a mood disorder and a sometimes crippling level of anxiety on top of it, too. I&#039;ve been using drugs for the last decade to cope with it and try to make everything numb enough to be okay.<br><br>I almost came out to my parents before puberty but I decided against it because I know how stigmatized being trans was and my only exposure to trans women was just like gag characters that looked like men. I almost transitioned multiple other times but always got scared or felt too hopeless and I didn&#039;t, and I regret it, but despite the regret I still can&#039;t make myself transition.

It&#039;s amazing that this song was played on radio, and no one cared back then.

I think why the girls growing up were confused by a &quot;boy always wanted to hang out with the girls&quot; is because I went to Christian/baptist/catholic schools and it was not only taboo but &quot;odd&quot; to them. I mean, I grew up in early 00s christianity where kids went around calling everyone even remotely lgbtq+ leaning the f slur.(sorry that and queer I do not use because growing up these were only used as insults and I don&#039;t like using them, personally). So, even though I never had a problem with lgbtq+ people I considered it a &quot;bad thing&quot; or I&#039;d be ostracised for being who I am. I&#039;m glad that I&#039;ve long since left that abusive christian side behind me. But why I added that was because to compensate for my true nature(growing beard out, watching westerns, cigars, that sort of thing. &quot;Manly&quot; tropes)<br>Anyway, I don&#039;t like the term &quot;non binary&quot; I prefer androgynous. So, I&#039;m &quot;coming out&quot; as androgynous which feels anti climatic because I feel like I&#039;m just stating who I&#039;ve always been. My pronouns are (she/they) and I like vaporwave, cats, and the tofu tacos that I make.

B/X is a much more elegant game than 5e. Combat is over in 1-3 rounds and doesn&#039;t have inflated HP totals. The XP system rewards treasure hunting over combat, which synchronizes with the core dungeon crawling gameplay loop instead of wandering through a line of railroaded DM plot points. The game only has 4 human classes and 3 nonhuman races, which is all you need for classic fantasy - a city full of mushroom people isn&#039;t so mystical in 5e when you have warforged astral self monks and psionic tiefing knights at home. That, and you don&#039;t have to make charisma rolls for intimidation or persuasion which means you won&#039;t be foiled by the d20 after actually doing good roleplaying. <br><br>5e doesn&#039;t use 3d6 down the line because you need to roll skill checks for absolutely everything. Player skill is much more important in OSR.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it makes for a different D&amp;D game one which modern rules and modern players just aren&#039;t built for. </span><br>I mean, it definitely makes for a different game. 5e has almost no mechanics for exploration at all, and the ones that exist are almost unplayable RAW. Personally I find dungeon crawling much more engaging when light isn&#039;t just an unlimited cantrip and your torch is a fragile safeguard between the party and a darkness full of monsters, but that&#039;s me, and I&#039;m not exactly an old gamer who was around when this stuff was current.", "filename": "unknown-20", "ext": ".png", "w": 576, "h": 432, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670883265791464, "time": 1670883265, "md5": "X1SsKo/T+eh3fQw7rq8eug==", "fsize": 390689, "resto": 28689926}, {"no": 28730309, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:35:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28729295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28729295</a><br>You a collector of some kind?", "time": 1670888109, "resto": 28689926}, {"no": 28730436, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)18:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28689926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28689926</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A/S/L</span><br>41/Male/North Dakota<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sexuality</span><br>Straight<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;About me</span><br>Passoid supremacist and srs advocate, by force.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hobbies/interests</span><br>I look young and i&#039;d like to meet trad trans people, not neccesarily for anything special i just have a type of humor that offends a lot of users of this board.

I will keep flirting with guys, I will let them spoil me. I do not lead them on. For example, one man who approached me was insistent. I told him I was not interested and that I had a boyfriend back home, but he begged me. He said he just wanted my company with no expectations. Super respectful. He took me to dinner and bought me flowers.

I love looking girly and being treated like a woman and I really don&#039;t act much like a man at all, but I told my girlfriend about my repressed trannyism and she asked if I wanted to go by female pronouns or anything and I said like I don&#039;t care or to just use male ones for now. The reason why is because it would just feel ridiculously forced to me, I look so obviously male and I think it would hurt worse to be called those pronouns. I want to eventually feel comfortable enough to go by them but I just don&#039;t. Getting called gendered pronouns in general bothers me. For some reason I&#039;m okay with people using female pronouns with me online, probably because they don&#039;t know what I look like so it doesn&#039;t feel forced to me. I think what really bothers me is the idea that someone physically sees me as a man and their brain wants to use male pronouns and I&#039;m like causing the cognitive dissonance asking them to call me something they don&#039;t see me as.<br><br><a href=\"#p28788170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28788170</a><br>What does the T stand for, anon?
