Brings me back to being on a school trip without anyone I knew where we had to form groups of our own, and having the teacher place me with all the popular kids. Or crying over something unfair that happened and having the teacher do something just because I&#039;m upset and not because the thing that made me upset was unfair. <br>Hard to describe the feeling right. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be my guest, be angry.. for a while. You have the right. This type of shit is not your fault, and if venting helps, by all means vent.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We can try and see how to pick up the pieces from there.</span><br>Thanks anon.. In the days since I posted I ended up sparking controversy in a completely different group, the only other group I was active in. Morally I feel I was in the right, I figured out a guy was cheating on his gf, but I was turned on by a lot of people. I no longer feel comfortable talking to these people and I spent what was started as a good day just crying in bed for hours. I&#039;m still just feeling super down, even more than depression usually has me at.<br>I don&#039;t know. I just seem to always cause problems. I can point to every loss of a friend and show all the ways that I was in the right but the common factor is me. Dozens of people in the past few years and basically all of them deciding they hate my guts.

So my hips, butt, thighs and boobs developed, and my waist got narrower. If you check my posting history, the post with the corset is from after that month. The corset isn&#039;t doing all that much.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That kind of movement is normally difficult to achieve that fast. Other things happened in the first 9 months, but nothing as dramatic as that one month. And since then it&#039;s continued, although slower as my E2 levels have settled down.

Current medical transition options does not allow to change your reproductive role to that of the other sex, instead you become temporarily or permanently infertile.<br>1. Having more people transition would create a bigger supply of females devaluing them on the dating market. Part of the reason why being a girl is exciting is having all these males desperately desire you. You eventually reach an equilibrium where transitioning is no longer worth it for most people.<br>2. Current medical transition options are ineffective at reversing masculinization that has already occurred, thus a lot of people find themselves stuck in male bodies they dislike with little hope of ever escaping that, sure they can go on HRT but that doesn&#039;t really solve their issue, at best it&#039;s a bandage.<br>3. There is a lot of people who are hostile against medical transition for various reasons trying to make life difficult for them.<br>4. A lot of males (maybe a majority) wouldn&#039;t voluntarily change their sex to female even if it required no effort and was a full sex-change (including for reproduction), let me know if you find a decent poll regarding this.<br>5. A lot of males will still be needed for things like wars, construction work, etc.<br><br>So do we have to accept the current status quo where people are either born as a female with no penis, born as a male unable to fully transition to female or intersex?<br><br>What we need to do is change human biology to abolish or phaze out the current 2 sexes and make new better humans with XZ-chromosomes.", "filename": "transmaxxing-flag", "ext": ".png", "w": 330, "h": 220, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1676196855611238, "time": 1676196855, "md5": "7TQ0TkDtZJRuM3YvVqviEA==", "fsize": 51790, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "everyone-should-get-to-experience-the-joys-of", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 29576279, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)05:14:47", "name": "vintologi.com", "com": "https://vintologi.com/threads/herma<wbr>phrodism.882/<br><br>child: 0 to 10<br>start of female puberty: 11 \u00b1 2<br>end of female fertility: 35 \u00b1 5<br>start of male puberty: 35 \u00b1 5<br>start of male fertility: 36 \u00b1 5<br><br>This approach solves all the problems.<br><br>0 is solved by having people normally be born with the reproductive organs for both sexes and have them develop fully later (first the female ones, later the male ones). Another potential solution is developing medicine further to the point where we can give someone born male vagina, ovaries and womb that works and that can actually support child-birth.<br><br>1 is solved by the fact that there would still be more males than females at any given moment unless males are subjected to very high mortality rate (such as due to war).<br><br>2 is solved by having people undergo female puberty early before having undergone enough male puberty to cause significant masculinization. Currently this is medically possible but hard to push through politically due to democracy. It&#039;s actually possible to bank sperm early in puberty but that isn&#039;t enough to make most people realize that people born male should be able to transition before 18.<br><br>3 is solved by having everyone go through female puberty, then there is no out-group, no majority to impose themselves on the minority. Otherwise even under authoritarianism there will be a lot of social tension due to people being uncomfortable with the trans thing.

Unfortunately the same can&#039;t be said for what has to be one the dullest franchise in the history of movie franchises. Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series\u2019 only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.<br><br>Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody, just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a-at least the books were good though </span><br>&quot;No!&quot;<br>The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible.

I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic.

Who do you want to be as a sissy? What turns you on? There are sissies who want to be meek and mild, there are sissies who want to be bold and brash, there are sissies who want to be fucksluts, who are you? What&#039;s your sissy-centric attitude?

To have a boyfriend?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Effort is nothing more than attitude in motion. Effort is the physical action you take to achieve your desires. Effort is shaving your legs, buying an outfit, and driving over to your Grindr Daddy&#039;s house at 2am.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The trick is to realize that putting in the effort isn&#039;t difficult. The fact of the matter is this, there are certain emotional &quot;crisis points&quot; where sissies like you are confronted with a sudden wallop of fear/nervousness, an insecurity, a worry, a panic.

Going into a store and buying a girly product, meeting a man, going to work the next day with shaved legs. Nobody cares, no one notices, nothing bad happens.

At the same store (or nearest costume shop) you pick up a wig for $20-40 Anything will do but in a pinch you can&#039;t go wrong with long platinum blonde.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Go to your nearest pharmacy/walmart/etc and purchase a cheap perfume ($10), eyeliner and lipstick ($10). I&#039;m talking bargain basement products.

Take some sexy selfies in the mirror.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8. Download Grindr. Make a profile using the photos you just took and write in the bio, &quot;Horny sissy looking for fun!&quot; and fill out the rest of your stats.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9. Chat with local men and invite an interesting guy over. Or, go over to his place.

We embody the same ideals the Greeks and many other cultures embodied; that of the youthful spirit. The ideal height of human intellect and idealism to spring forth ideas about the infinite ability for humans to &quot;transcend&quot;. This is also where the idea of perpetual progress and the end of history comes from. Or the power to &quot;change the world&quot;. There are many different manifestations of this.<br><br>We worship the divine child because of its seemingly infinite potential, while the East worships and respects elders.

But it&#039;s true. The psychology surrounding the dynamics of gender identity and attraction to the concepts of masculine and feminine are inherently intertwined, and their very existence is that which defines being truly a man or a woman in gender identity.<br>In essence, the psychology towards sexuality and gender identity surrounds that of a platonic ideal of a man. Strong, self-reliant, supporting, caring yet harsh, etc. This is due to evolution surrounding being this platonic man, as this platonic man has the physical and psychological features that ensure someone whom can successfully hunt, gather, perform duties requiring heavy labor, etc. and help improve the chances of survival for a greater tribe.<br>By consequence of this, the mental attraction to this platonic man - including real-world counterparts, such as the &quot;Daddy&quot; type, the &quot;Gangster&quot; type, the &quot;Businessman&quot; type, etc. - is something primarily done in servitude to the platonic man for a variety of reasons. The first and foremost of which is to validate the platonic man&#039;s contributions to his tribe, to give a feeling of appreciation and care. This allows the platonic man to overextend his abilities to those besides himself. The second is to provide the platonic man physical goods, including pleasure and children. Note these two are not mutually exclusive, however.<br>This servility to the platonic man, therefore, defines the opposite of the platonic man. It defines the platonic woman. As a man is the opposite of woman, platonic woman is the opposite of platonic man. Ergo, to truly be a woman, your sexuality must be developed as a way to serve the platonic man.

The determining factor is sex chromosomes. XY, XX, etc.<br>The problem arises when our traditional, biological viewpoint on sex meets mutation. At least in humans seeing as we&#039;re typically binary and other species have a strange number of sex options, different reproductive methods, etc.<br>So in a human we can have a chromosomal variation. XXY for example.<br>It causes the person in question to have developmental differences, any number of them by the way as their &quot;DNA&quot; is &quot;kinda fucked&quot; biologically speaking.<br>This is what we call Intersex but you might know it by the archaic term hermaphrodite. <br>Now, how do we classify this person in the colloquial sense if biologically they fall out of the &quot;male-female&quot; binary?<br>Typically through social indicators. How they look, sound, and identify. We&#039;ll call them a &quot;Woman&quot; or &quot;Man&quot; based off that, generally speaking.<br>So we have an outlier case that breaks our understanding of &quot;Gender&quot; as it seems to not always conform with &quot;Sex&quot;. Ultimately an Intersex person may wish to identify one way or another, or perhaps even take on a third social role as &quot;Non-Binary&quot;.<br><br>Now, to answer directly about transgender people.<br>We have Gender Dysphoria. Which relates to a sense of self and identity. You&#039;re right, a transgender person can look at their genitals and understand their Sex, their body, etc. This is why it&#039;s Dysphoria and not Dysmorphia - There is no inherent delusion about what they really are.<br>However, their identity, a social concept of relating to how one views themselves, is not inline with a traditional identity relating to their sex. (IE Male = Boy/Man.)<br>So what they seek to change is how others view them, and typically through therapy an acceptance of their inner desire to &quot;be&quot; another Gender.<br>Dysphoria is obviously a lifelong disorder, but long term studies have shown that these treatments ALLEVIATE it by changing the image to reflect the ideal of the patient (Transition).<br>Hope that helps.", "time": 1676165915, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29571952, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:41:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bitches know me as F.E.A.R. cause I got that deep Penetrator", "time": 1676166096, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29571971, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:43:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Liar thread.", "filename": "Screenshot_20230211-204209_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 2220, "tn_w": 60, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676166192769390, "time": 1676166192, "md5": "ejU/Y0+LQ788ee2jJXWyBA==", "fsize": 522592, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572035, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:48:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29571952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29571952</a><br>FLASHLIGHT", "time": 1676166532, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572053, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:50:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29570064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29570064</a><br>Well before I got it remove I called it mr ugly lol", "time": 1676166631, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572054, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:50:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29570064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29570064</a><br>dont care about this thread. how do i find more of this artists work?", "time": 1676166632, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572105, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:55:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29571971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29571971</a><br>I put clit <a href=\"#p29570745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29570745</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;:(</span>", "time": 1676166900, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572215, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)21:04:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29572053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29572053</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mr ugly </span><br>lmao good one", "time": 1676167476, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572941, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:14:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29571109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29571109</a><br>man detected", "time": 1676171692, "resto": 29570064}, {"no": 29572951, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:16:06", "name": "Puffin", "com": "<a href=\"#p29570064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29570064</a><br>pp", "time": 1676171766, "resto": 29570064, "trip": "!!FbUWYWdHViW"}, {"no": 29572964, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:17:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29570509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29570509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go through the operations of mtf</span><br>do you think it&#039;s 1960?
