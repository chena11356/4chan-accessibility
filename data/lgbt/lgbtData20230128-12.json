The best thing you can do right now is seek comfort. In friends, family, song, food (in moderation).. It won&#039;t help you process, and you will have to, but first you need to get over the initial shock, which can take a few days. When you feel you have gained a little distance to the event (it will still hurt though, sadly..) we can talk over the options you could take it and how you feel about them. Whatever you do though, don&#039;t look for reasons, don&#039;t try to rationalize if you can help it.

I&#039;m a straight man but even I can tell when a man is beautiful, and it&#039;s very rare. Someone who is beautiful just triggers someone in people of all genders and sexual orientation. Straight guys want to hang out with and be nice to very attractive men who are charismatic. <br><br>Most men are ugly. In the past most men got to breed because women needed them for money, home, food, etc. Now we have roughly 80% of women chasing 20% of men. Those men who are attractive, tall, have money or status. I don&#039;t really blame them, when I look at most men I could not imagine them all sweaty laying on me naked its gross. So just like weak/pretty men in prison, women just find the most tolerable man they can to have the nice life and to deter the loser males. <br><br>Another factor is genetics and nature. A woman will have a biological animalistic drive that can be triggered by certain men doing the right things and its hard for them to control, they even regret sometimes hooking up with guys. Its like biology took over. Their minds are able to convince them they like a guy to stay with them like stockholm syndrome. They needed this to survive in the past when breeding consisted of males from other tribes capturing them and keeping them. Humans bred a lot of generations like this so we adapted mentally. <br><br>I do wish women could evolve past needing the tallest man around. Sure a big guy might work as a deterrent to most men, but they can be beaten up by men slightly smaller, happens in boxing all the time.

I actually prefer him to any guy tall and broad, because he has the perfect mix of physically fem and masc features. I&#039;m attracted to his leaned and toned muscles, the angularity of his body, his broad shoulders and chest, his boysmell, his masc behavioural qualities like his suave confident charismatic airs of taking slightly aggressive initiative (but without being assholish) yet also the times where he acts like a dumb impatient cute dog, and all the little masc-coded protective little things he does for me. I do in fact greatly enjoy if he lies down on me naked and sweaty. At the same time, him being a clean-shaven twunk on the shorter side makes him legitimately adorable looking, he has big cute anime eyes, he smiles and laughs in a feminine way that makes most men seem dead inside by comparison, his pitch has a melodic almost-angelic androgynous-leaning quality, he has fem-leaning hobbies we engage in together like listening to trashy pop music and watching Netflix and pop psychology and making candles and catsitting, and he verbalises his feelings a lot which I can appreciate and relate to. <br><br>Men can definitely be beautiful or handsome or just generally genuinely attractive, in a way inherent to their bodies, even putting dick completely aside. Anyone who can&#039;t relate just is not androphilic enough. And he doesn&#039;t have to be chad thundercock, maybe it matters that my bf is 3 inches taller than me, but that and more importantly his behaviour are already enough for me to feel protected.

I mean, look at /a/. /a/ is one of the oldest boards on 4chan and it&#039;s rife with BOTH of those issues.

I mean, look at gaygen. <br>I feel a lot of people, especially newfags from ~2016, have a romantic ideal of what 4chan is, was or is meant to be that is incongruous with reality. They point to the anonymity or trends of 4chan without understanding their roots or purpose. They wanna seem cool or just have a hatred of trips from most trips being annoying egotistical asshats. <br>I can&#039;t really say that&#039;s unwarranted or unjustified, but in my experience, the amount of egotistical trips on this general aren&#039;t much higher than the amount of egotistical people on 4chan in general. Really, most of the annoying or attention-whorey people who DO post on bigen tend to be non-trip avatarfags.<br>&#039;Course, you could be against avatarfagging too, but that just brings us back to the previous point of bisexuality not being a diverse enough topic to justify a regular general.

Both have sexual implications but one has a very specific audience. That, and I was in specific circles of people who indulged in specifically loli. If these places didn&#039;t exist I would have had very few places to go. Going into most sexual online groups and going &quot;haha everyone I&#039;m 9!!&quot; would immediately have me banned. Going into loli groups and going &quot;haha everyone I&#039;m 9!!&quot; would sometimes have me banned but would often have me crowned the server/chat/group &quot;loli&quot; and in private conversations would almost always illicit sexual advances.

Never once do they mention problems they have with our relationship, their needs in relationships, nor do they understand social dynamics outside of casual interaction. Examples are disagreeing with one \u201cfriend\u201d and then them freaking out about me behind my back and then when confronted about it directly, diverting from the actual problem and using direct insults. Another is having a miscommunication with one person, confronting it head on and saying I need communication in the future and then them not doing that which repeats the cycle of me asking for communication, and them not. I\u2019ll add that most of these people are cishet. I communicate my needs in all my relationships as well as things I think people need to know if having relationships with me, like that I have CPTSD and an intellectual disorder (like autism) but these people don\u2019t take that into consideration in our interactions. Whenever I do this with Gen Z or Gen Xers, they take this into account. Why are millennials high school-ass communicators? What the fuck is wrong with that generation?

factory option for 35&quot; tires lol but bare minimum i want that tundra infotainment system. also the 2023 bison edition colorado might be fucking dope desu. right now i&#039;m sad to say the most appealing option is the sierra 1500 duramax 3L with extended range tank and the at4x package. no hate for toyota but the interiors for the two size trucks id prefer are deal breakers rn. tundra i could be cool with but if i&#039;m getting that size i&#039;ve always wanted to try a diesel truck and the sierra looks bad as fuck blacked out picrel", "filename":

something different and i think i might like this format next time around, always been anxious on the road after witnessing a few accidents and a truck would alleviate some of that as well as make me feel less vulnerable to hatecriming. also i work from home so fuel cost is less of a concern for me so its more about picking something i can keep for ten years, also i own a house now so itd be nice

If 1 billion people supported you, I&#039;d be one of them. If 1 million people supported you, I&#039;d be one of them. If 10 people supported you, I&#039;d be one of them. If one person supported you, that would be me. If no one supported you, I&#039;d be dead. If the world hates you, I hate the world.
