There&#039;s a retinoic acid receptor just like estrogen and testosterone and glucocorticoid receptors. You&#039;re supposed to stop using retin-A and accutane during pregnancy and breastfeeding for a reason: it will have systemic effects on a developing fetus and infant. Using a topical medication as an adult will not have the same effects as exposing a developing embryo or fetus to it.</span><br><br>Retinol is not as regulated. The justification for this is that first, retinol is a vitamin A derivative naturally found in an omnivorous diet. Secondly, retinol has to cross the skin barrier to the living cells underneath. Then retinol has to be converted to biologically active retinoids with an enzyme in the skin (human retinol dehydrogenase is the name of the enzyme if you want to look it up). This reaction is limited by both enzyme and substrate. Retinols will be destroyed over time by the presence of blue light/UV light. The best bet is to buy retinol from a large company that will be beholden to cGMP and quality assurance. I know that goes against a lot of the values here, but even an unregulated drug is still a drug and I wouldn&#039;t trust etsy to make my drugs.<br><br> Skincare blogging has become a cottage industry absolutely overcrowded with unqualified voices. Vitamin A derivatives are screened for cancer chemotherapeutic agents specifically because they are (1) potent and biologically active molecules and (2) (likely to be) safer than things like cisplatin because they are analogues of vitamin A instead of inorganic molecules that kill cells. Plant derivatives of vitamin A (carotenoids) like beta carotene and lycopene, are also screened for anti-cancer activity.<br><br>cont.", "filename": "tumblr_ac1ae6a9bd77f2d12c4081b4a1c9d987_c3714cf6_1280", "ext": ".png", "w": 675, "h": 152, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 28, "tim": 1672291553467180, "time": 1672291553, "md5": "O1JebsW4iFF9fjBoFaLK0A==", "fsize": 15708, "resto": 28947120}, {"no": 28947417, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:26:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "actually i just like to listen to it in general. but i do also feel down most of the time.", "time": 1672291588, "resto": 28947120}, {"no": 28947427, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:27:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28947413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28947413</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One thing you can do to get more impartial information is to use more scientific search terms.

I&#039;m not saying this is like a gender dysphoria (although the nights spent crying and crying over my appearance where there&#039;s nothing I want more than to get to be a kid of either sex again do make me wonder) but that there&#039;s something deep down that likes when traits about myself after more childlike, and I also like when other people notice, someone irl a while ago said (just based on my personality) that I should be a kid, and I appreciated that but it also made me sad that I will just always be too big for someone to truly think of me as childlike in the way that a really short small-framed person might be infantilised by the people around them. I know people say the grass is always greener and I would hate it if I lived out but I promise from the years and years of struggling with this that I know for a fact that I would not hate being treated that way.<br>Knowing that I can never be short and small enough to be taken care of by a normal height woman and that at best we could be a &quot;tall couple&quot; if I found a gf taller than me, when plenty of people get to look like picrel, hurts like none else.", "filename": "l2htoz3o99j61", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1894, "h": 1920, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672242615464185, "time": 1672242615, "md5": "ilvS4UgFWJpTfEhIFzoJhA==", "fsize": 411896, "resto": 28929240}, {"no": 28937524, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)12:09:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28936846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28936846</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE anything scat/shit related, anything about pooping your diaper,</span><br>Poser.
