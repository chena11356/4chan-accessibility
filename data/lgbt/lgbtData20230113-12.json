Transitioning has caused me to constantly obsess about my appearance and how insufficient it is and it has made me wayy less considerate of others than i used to be in the past. My family still have a high appraisal of me because I only talk about body image shit on the internet so they get all of the good parts of the personality and not the bad so idk.

I am just striving to be a more well balanced person as each day passes by, whether it&#039;s improving how well I pass or my skillset. I like learning new languages, I&#039;m currently learning my fourth, hoping to learn Arabic or Chinese next. I&#039;m NBcoping right now because I value my family too much to tear it apart by transitioning. I like reading manga and webcomics, I don&#039;t keep up with many anime nowadays but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find common ground no matter what. I like cars, fitness, music, tech, clothing, and drawing as well. Recently, I&#039;ve been trying to get back into roleplaying, so if you add me for that purpose, I&#039;d be more than happy to draw OCs. I&#039;m currently a Junior in university, getting a BSN. I used to cosplay a lot and go to cons when I was younger, I still dabble here and there but not as much nowadays.

Then I tried to stop this agp stuff last year but I noticed how the urge never went away. Then some anons here told me I&#039;m probably trans and I thought really hard about it and I came to the conclusion that I really am trans.<br>I assumed myself to be a MtF (male to female) and I lost my mind every single day since then. It was bad lol.<br><br>So I seeked out a therapist who works with trans people and who can get them on HRT and after one month of therapy I found out that I actually don&#039;t identify as a woman haha. The therapist asked me what I want to be and I tried to say a woman but I couldn&#039;t. I just couldn&#039;t say it. I thought it was because of shame because I don&#039;t pass as one. In the next session he asked me again and I said a woman this time but I did it with so little confidence he could tell I was forcing myself to say it.<br>So after some sessions he told me that he can tell that I am unsure of my gender identity and that he can&#039;t get me on HRT if I don&#039;t know what I am yet. And he also said that just because I don&#039;t identify as man that it doesn&#039;t mean that I must identify as woman.<br>So yeah I&#039;m not MtF. But I still identify as trans because I don&#039;t identify as a man. I&#039;m not a man. I guess I&#039;m just non binary.<br><br>Ooooh my god I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t get on HRT by lying to myself through the therapy sessions. If I had gotten on HRT, or if I had done DIY, I would have lost my mind so much more. Then eventually after some months on HRT I think I would have eventually figured out that something is just off and that I&#039;m not MtF. Then I would have doubted my decision of going on HRT and then I would probably detrans and I would be a mess.", "filename": "url(12)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673606645102086, "time": 1673606645, "md5": "tZ2fEu3xNztbdGcA0PaTUQ==", "fsize": 274919, "resto": 29160898}, {"no": 29162669, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:45:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29162660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29162660</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(continued (i know it&#039;s so much to read sorry))</span><br><br>Now I am considering if I want to go on HRT as a nonbinary person. I&#039;m not a man and I don&#039;t like the idea that with every month that passes that I&#039;ll keep masculinizing. I want to be feminine and I think I would be more &quot;me&quot; if I could get on HRT. <br>And I pretty much cured myself of my agp which is so nice. Back then in those four years I would put on super cringe femboy stuff and then jerk off to it, bruh. But now that I&#039;m expressing femininity in an authentic way I don&#039;t have the urge to do it in this cringy fetish way. I am wearing nail polish, make up, earrings and cute hair clips (my hair is getting long now so I wear clips to hold them in place) and I talk in a softer voice now. The other students in my uni probably think I&#039;m some genderqueer effeminate homosexual but I don&#039;t care. It just feels better to present myself like this. I also feel more social and open that way.<br>And the pressure to get on HRT is not so high anymore. When I still believed I was MtF I thought that I need to get on HRT asap and fully transition into a woman so that I can be happy in life. But now this pressure is gone and I feel so much better now.<br>So my plan now is I want to take 2 months to think about HRT. Now that the insane pressure is off my mind I want to see how I feel in two months about hrt.<br>And shoutouts to my therapist he is so nice. He said once I&#039;m certain about my gender identity and I still want to get on HRT I should just come to him again and he can help me out.

I&#039;d been religiously spraying it for the first few months.<br>If you&#039;re like me and didn&#039;t get a buzzcut, get ready to suffer during the first 2 weeks. You&#039;ll be using a baby shampoo because it&#039;s super mild which one the one hand is good for your donor and recipient areas, but on the other hand isn&#039;t great for your normal hair, especially if it&#039;s long. Your normal hair will feel awful. Luckily, you&#039;ll be wearing a funny hat during that time, so no one will see that atrocity :v<br>After that switch a bandana or a beanie.<br>As I said in that thread I didn&#039;t use minox during my recovery, even Patty that using it as a tranny wasn&#039;t great because as she said &quot;you&#039;ll be growing hair in all kinds of funny places&quot; :v I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ll be staying in Thailand for the time being, get copper peptides from gravich, it&#039;s like local the ordinary, just a lot cheaper and easier to come by. Eveandboy sells it, there&#039;s also an official shopee store, https://shp. ee/5ihppyi.<br>There&#039;s some research into it, it basically strengthens hair follicles and helps to form and stabilise new blood vessels. I&#039;m honestly attributing my smooth recovery to it. It could be a placebo, it could be whatever, I&#039;ve been using copper peptides in my skincare anyway, so whatevs. Basically, after washing your hair and spraying the recipient area with saline, apply a couple of drops and geeently tap it to spread it. <br>Good luck, nona &lt;3", "filename": "20220517_032509", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 907, "h": 1210, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673599043883434, "time": 1673599043, "md5": "b83PylV3kCzc9OGeSO04Aw==", "fsize": 860927, "resto": 29153109}, {"no": 29161857, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:39:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29161842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29161842</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even Patty that</span><br>even Patty agreed that*", "time": 1673599153, "resto": 29153109}, {"no": 29162358, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:01:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there like only so long you can go without a grown hair that these drugs fail to recover much?

I think everyone deserves to experience love and affection. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does anyone else feel the same way or is it better to default to dying alone?</span><br>I&#039;m into men, and I love a man, so I feel different, for me it&#039;s enough that he accepts me and supports me in what I do, and doesn&#039;t have weird expectations related to my &quot;transition&quot;, and is also into men, in terms of shared experience. Like I couldn&#039;t be with a straight dude who expected me to be a woman, but I also couldn&#039;t be with a super masc4masc gay who hated me getting breasts. I think &quot;being a manmoder&quot; is not important to me in terms of romantic relationships. I get you in a way, though. Even if I passed as a woman and some straight guy who never was with other men loved me, I probably wouldn&#039;t really relate as much as to another man who is also into men.<br>I think you shouldn&#039;t default to dying alone if you don&#039;t desire that, even if it&#039;s hard to find someone, and even if people will hurt you in the process, and vice-versa. I hope you&#039;ll find someone compatible, be it a manmoder or someone else you&#039;re attracted to. There&#039;s nothing wrong with your attraction, but I think it might be a bit sad if you were only into someone because you felt like you didn&#039;t deserve someone more compatible. At the same time, it can take a while to fall in love and figure out compatibility. You should try to meet people and be vulnerable and allow them to be vulnerable. It&#039;s impossible to force it I think, so don&#039;t beat yourself up over it if it takes time to meet people.<br>Sorry if that doesn&#039;t make much sense, but good luck anon.", "time": 1673583840, "resto": 29141737}, {"no": 29159805, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:26:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29159564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29159564</a><br>you&#039;re probably not wrong but I seem to be fundamentally incompatible with everyone, so I think not even another manmoder would work with me...<br><br>it&#039;s not like I wouldn&#039;t be open to the idea otherwise though", "time": 1673583993, "resto": 29141737}, {"no": 29159870, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:34:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29159787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29159787</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Like I couldn&#039;t be with a straight dude who expected me to be a woman</span><br>I have this exact same preference (I like men too) but I&#039;m just so defeated to the point where finding a manmoder as a partner seems to be a lot more appealing. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You should try to meet people and be vulnerable and allow them to be vulnerable.</span><br>That&#039;s... too hard, it kills me to see people with their disgusted looks.

He doesn&#039;t make any appeals to God, Religion, Philosophy, Morality, Science, Reason etc. etc. When I was at my most suicidal, I wouldn&#039;t have given two shits if someone tried to convince me that &quot;Jesus would be sad&quot; or &quot;Your electromagnetic waves won&#039;t be in tune with the noosphere when your brain stops functioning.&quot; Maybe someone will find it refreshing to hear an argument for Life that accepts only what we know about the world, that it is cold and brutal. At the very least, maybe contemplating the ideas in the video will be a helpful mental exercise to keep your mind off worse thoughts.<br>It should be noted that, obviously, if you are feeling suicidal, please seek help from a phone call or professional.

Not being able to get enjoyment from any hobbies or social activities, having 0 motivation or discipline, 0 sex drive. I know I\u2019ll probably pull out of it in a month or three.

I have so many things I want to do but I can\u2019t motivate myself to get out of bed before noon or do anything beyond the simplest of chores and self-care. <br><br>It even feels hard to relate sometimes, so many other accounts of depression talk about self-annihilation, ending the suffering. I\u2019ve never considered it. Nothing scares me more than mortality. It\u2019s why I hate myself for wasting time that I\u2019ll never get back. <br><br>And I have almost every possible support structure. I have close friends who I see multipletimes a week, who truly care about me and support me. A cat who loves to cuddle. A supportive therapist and doctor.

Constantly procrastinating and beating myself up for not being able to focus or self-motivate. Finally got diagnosed 2 months ago at age 30.

Adderall just felt like chugging 2 energy drinks, did nothing to help with motivation or executive function, and made hyperfocus way worse. Made it way too easy to stay up til 5am posting or online shopping. Currently 2 weeks into Wellbutrin, which should take effect around week 3 or 4. So far, it only seems to make me cry a bit more. If this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll just have to keep working through the list of stimulants, SNRIs, NRIs, NDRIs, SSRIs, etc. Feels like it could easily take a year or more to dial in the right dosages in the medication cocktail.", "time": 1673606237, "resto": 29141916}, {"no": 29162640, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)05:40:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29162583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29162583</a><br>That sounds rather dangerous.

For you it might be bc you find spinning fun and exhilarating, or you really enjoy basketball and they have a basketball court. Without fun, your mind will constantly work against you bc we want to stay calm and comfortable.

Now the normal type of estrogen you get is the exact same type that appears in your body, and it&#039;s not associated with any health risks like blood clots. However, the cancer thing is sort of right: you have a much higher chance of breast cancer (still lower than cis women though). But in turn, you have a much, much lower chance of testicular cancer or prostate cancer, which are extremely common in men.

That, plus the HRT having rapid, large positive effects on the mental health things I&#039;d struggled with (to the point that I now realize I was most likely suffering from deporsonalization issues due to repressed gender dysphoria and not autism) combined to make me feel like I&#039;d suddenly woken up in another reality and people were finally treating me in a way that felt right and comfortable to me.<br><br>Now understand: I was in a position to choose to lean into one or the other of the two parts of me, and found one of them worked out massively better than the other, but this doesn&#039;t mean I think the same would be true for everyone.
