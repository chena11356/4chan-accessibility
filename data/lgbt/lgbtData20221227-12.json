It&#039;s the hand we&#039;re dealt, at least it&#039;s better than being born paralyzed from the neck down or something. The main difference between this and other problems people have is that most people will take pity on you and have sympathy for you for your struggle and encourage you to get treatment, but when you&#039;re trans, a lot of people will feel like disgust and hatred and won&#039;t want you to treat your problems. We just want to make our pain go away because living this way is so hard. I don&#039;t want to have to cross the bridge either but being on this side really sucks. If I could wake up tomorrow as a passing trans woman, I&#039;d do it, even if everyone still thought I was a man and I had to explain the awkwardness.

The fear that you&#039;ll never reach the other side is really real too, it seems terrifying to be stuck as visibly trans no matter what. I have hope though, I need to have hope.

It feels necessary for me to be a woman to be truly happy, and turning myself into a woman is something that feels so drastic and insane.

Only get face piercings if your moderately cute, whatever gender u are, otherwise you will look 10x worse and cringier. Nipple piercings are a waste, not super aesthetic imo and my nipples don\u2019t feel any different (very fun when my gf bites on them and pulls though).

I like music a lot more than arguing with trannies but I haven&#039;t been able to talk about music with anyone in like a month because youtube doesn&#039;t allow comments on songs and neither as far as I&#039;m aware does any music service. I feel as if the reason behind this is to dumb people down and limit the politically incorrect and artistic medium that is music in favor of sterilized shit like video game streaming on politically correct giant streaming platforms that are impossible to compete with, that makes cultural appreciation tend to revolve around consuming video games made by companies that are also politically correct. And social media like Instagram, which creates product lust and status anxiety, social media like Facebook which is an uncanny approximation of real-wotld socialization except sanitized of political incorrectness, touch, and potential fighting.<br>, etc. Anyone being able to make a song and anyone being able to comment on it and create buzz and social change via discourse on art threatens to undermine the ZOG program. Music is going the way of poetry and I think they want it that way. Music is social and therefore potentially dangerous. They want lockdowns, escapism into characters external to the self (identity dissociation), and parasociality as opposed to sociality.

Well, the erection can be physically eager like that - easy to push over the edge to cum as well. Jesus christ i&#039;m turning myself on. Anyway. <br><br>On top of that can be other dimensions such as mental horniness. Like you may or may not actually want to fuck someone, or you might just want to cum.
