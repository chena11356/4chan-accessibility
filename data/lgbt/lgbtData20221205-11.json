Both diet and exercise and pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity, but only the former was associated with loss of intra-abdominal fat. Pioglitazone increased total body fat, which preferentially accumulated in the lower body depot in both men and women. WHRs decreased in both groups. Abdominal fat cell size decreased (P = 0.06) after diet and exercise. No statistically significant changes in fat cell size were observed in pioglitazone-treated volunteers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conclusions: In nondiabetic upper body obese subjects, increasing insulin sensitivity via diet and exercise accompanies reductions in visceral fat. Pioglitazone treatment also improves insulin sensitivity and lowers WHR, but this is due to a selective increase in lower body fat. This confirms a site-specific responsiveness of adipose tissue to TZD and suggests that improvements in insulin sensitivity by pioglitazone are achieved independent of changes in intra-abdominal fat.</span>", "time": 1670228321, "resto": 28625562}, {"no": 28628780, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:22:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28627749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28627749</a><br>Do you only consider studies on transwomen valid?
