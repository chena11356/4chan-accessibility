Trans girls used to be boys. Chances are they grew up as boys until the age of ~15. In this time of growing up they are more likely to play video games, use the internet and generally get interested in weeb and nerd culture. In this way, trans girls are more commonly involved in nerdy and weeby culture than cis girls. This makes them much more appealing to many men, who more commonly play video games and are more commonly nerds. Trans girls are simply more likely to be the desirable nerdy neet losers that all men desire. Of course, cis women can also be this way, it is simply much more uncommon for cis women.

When the timer is up, slowly pour in the water - pouring in a circular or zig-zag motion if you want to get fancy with it. Stop when there\u2019s about 1 inch of space left between the top of the French Press and the frothy beanwater slurry. Quickly start another kitchen timer for 4:00. Leave the lid off the French Press.<br><br>While the coffee is brewing, get out your cups and hot cocoa packets. Pour one packet in each cup. When the timer goes off, put the lid on the French Press and slowly (but firmly) depress the plunger. Maybe ask if it\u2019s spending another Christmas alone, idk. Fill each cup almost all the way to the top, then stir until there aren\u2019t any clumps of dry cocoa on the bottom of the cup. Add a splash of half &amp; half to finish. You might have to add some, stir it in, sip your coffee to check if it\u2019s enough, then add a little more to taste.<br><br>You\u2019re done!

It&#039;s your call whether you think he deserves it, I can only base this off of my perspective and say I wouldn&#039;t distance myself. The point is that the reason you would not trust your own feelings if you tried to get back together is because he&#039;s placed that seed of unreliability in your mind, but if he somehow shows to you that you can trust him again then that changes the situation. This involves a lot of interpretation of his conviction and whether you can still see your lives intertwining forwards into the future, so like I said it&#039;s ultimately your call. There will be no easy decision to make in this situation, that&#039;s why betrayal from those you love hurts so much, but in the absence of a decision that you&#039;ll be fully satisfied with, you have to make the decision that you think will lead to either your own development as a person or the mutual development of the both of you if you still desire that.", "time": 1672025421, "resto": 28887396}, {"no": 28906069, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)22:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28900611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28900611</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;individual self determination comune</span><br>Psych majors who are fu of themselves?", "time": 1672025537, "resto": 28887396}, {"no": 28906096, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)22:34:59", "name": "Kookaburra", "com": "<a href=\"#p28905495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28905495</a><br>whats your plans cbp also what did you get for xmas<br><br><a href=\"#p28905530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28905530</a><br>wtffff you were supposed to go to bed, now youre gonna see all the lewd things bigen does after your bedtime nooooo", "time": 1672025699, "resto": 28887396, "trip": "!!b+IacvR0I2h"}, {"no": 28906179, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)22:42:18", "name": "Aidan", "com": "<a href=\"#p28906030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28906030</a><br>kk hold on.<br>Keep in mind work in prog etc<br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ct<wbr>da_U7oYOtQsL81l8Ii9oYNXN_RMsAn/view<wbr>?usp=sharing<br>This link should work; you should also be able to comment in the pdf.

Obviously teens shouldn&#039;t have any surgery with permanent effects or anything like that, but there&#039;s nothing wrong with hormones. I also know a ftm detransitioner who took T from age 16 to 18 and she just lives as a regular woman with a slightly deeper voice now. It&#039;s not like T is going to ruin someone&#039;s body. Many cis women are already born with higher amounts of it. It&#039;s a natural hormone, not an invasive surgery, relax.", "time": 1671930965, "resto": 28892015}, {"no": 28893803, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:16:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28893798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893798</a><br>literally this", "time": 1671931015, "resto": 28892015}, {"no": 28893807, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:17:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28892642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28892642</a><br>why are you here<br><a href=\"#p28893396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893396</a><br>I feel the same nonnie, most of my friends are normal trans women so that helps", "time": 1671931025, "resto": 28892015}, {"no": 28893828, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28893807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893807</a><br>yeah i&#039;m friends with plenty of trans girls, and they&#039;re really sweet. it&#039;s mostly just the ones on here that get all tied in a knot over &quot;afabs&quot; and make threads like these. a loud and annoying minority.", "time": 1671931147, "resto": 28892015}, {"no": 28893830, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:19:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28893761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893761</a><br><a href=\"#p28893761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893761</a><br>what mtfs and cis men dont get is that basically all the privilege of being a woman only comes if youre femme and have good social skills. if youre butch or dont do fembrained shit like being scared of men or compulsively smoothing over conflict or &#039;uplifting women&#039; solely for being female, men don&#039;t make your life easier just because they want to fuck you and women make your life harder because of their crab bucket mentality. you can see it in this thread even <a href=\"#p28893697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893697</a> where its &#039;internalized misogyny&#039; to say you think female social dynamics are retarded", "time": 1671931160, "resto": 28892015}, {"no": 28893832, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:19:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28893750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28893750</a><br>All global logistics would get instantly fucked.

Sometimes dysphoria is extreme and I want to die and I&#039;m about to get on HRT, then it relents for a bit and I question if transitioning is worth it or not, and the cycle repeats. My body image and mood swing all over the place like that too, my life is just a rollercoaster ride and I&#039;m hanging on for dear life. Maybe I&#039;ll be able to make myself do it soon before I waste most of my life thinking about doing something without ever doing it or do something drastic.<br><a href=\"#p28903742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28903742</a><br>Yeah, you&#039;re doing pretty good honestly, I&#039;d gender you female<br><a href=\"#p28903932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28903932</a><br>You are, you&#039;re only 5 months in and I wouldn&#039;t gender you male.", "time": 1672027532, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28906522, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)23:09:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28906372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28906372</a><br>kys", "time": 1672027796, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28906537, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)23:11:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28906522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28906522</a><br>nope i transitioned early enough that i dont need to be apart of the 51% maybe u do hon", "time": 1672027871, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28907217, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)00:12:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28906537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28906537</a><br>did you mean 41%", "time": 1672031527, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28907252, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)00:15:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28907217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28907217</a><br>I heard it was 51% now", "time": 1672031745, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28908057, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)01:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28906537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28906537</a><br><a href=\"#p28907217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28907217</a><br><a href=\"#p28907252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28907252</a><br>I&#039;m almost sure that statistic includes people who have even had suicidal thoughts, and those aren&#039;t exactly uncommon even with cis people, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s like half of all trannies are roping", "time": 1672036595, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28908441, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:37:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28908057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28908057</a><br>this, the meme statistic is constantly misrepresented, i guarantee 99.99% of the people who use it have never seen the source and actual meaning of the number, its just become a perpetual social contagion thing where everyone repeating it assumes it to be true because they see so many others confidently saying it means that, because that person saw everyone else confidently saying it and so on", "time": 1672040253, "resto": 28895035}, {"no": 28908555, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:03:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hi 24 cismale autosexual bpdemon just wanted to come through with my honest opinion c:<br><br><a href=\"#p28895035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28895035</a><br>this is not good at all.<br><br><a href=\"#p28895313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28895313</a><br>you look like a girl<br><br><a href=\"#p28895379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28895379</a><br>you look like a girl (cleft chin is equal between men/women in case anyone says retarded shit)<br><br><a href=\"#p28895965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28895965</a><br>You look really cool!

I mean I know I&#039;m not an uggo, I&#039;m just really manfaced, and I tend to attract a lot of guys because of that.<br>But after my last breakup I just don&#039;t feel like dating seriously for the time being, I miss having a regular partner, but I understand that I&#039;m not in the best shape for having one rn.<br>And there&#039;s also the question of FFS, like, I&#039;ll get mine in a couple of years, however, many facial features men find attractive in me, like, my strong brow, my hunter gaze, etc, are also the features that make me feel like shit. The only exception is my jaw, I like it, haha. The thing is, most relationships don&#039;t really survive through FFS, the more radical it is, the less likely you&#039;re to stay together. While FFS is a necessity for us, many partners say that they feel like they&#039;re waking up next to a stranger, not the person they fell in love with, and stuff like that. It&#039;s not the same as ageing together which happens gradually, with FFS quite often there&#039;s just too much change in a short period of time for the partner&#039;s brain to process and catch up.<br>And lastly, I&#039;m a loser with a Russian passport. I had to break up with my Norwegian bf of 3 years when he&#039;s transferred to another country for work because I couldn&#039;t marry him and follow him via the spouse visa. My country doesn&#039;t recognise same sex stuff, and I couldn&#039;t go to Norway to get married there because I was denied Schengen TWICE.

They have even been reported as having &quot;voluptuous breasts&quot; (Roy Hertz et al., 1966; Valentine, 1969; Polani, 1970). John McLean Morris, the gynecologist who reviewed and summarized all of the existing scientific literature on CAIS women in 1953 (including 82 cases) and gave their condition the (now-obsolete) name &quot;testicular feminization&quot;, described their breasts as &quot;unusually large&quot; and &quot;jumbo-sized&quot; (Morris, 1953; Quigley et al., 1995). He additionally said in his famous 1953 review that they had &quot;normal female breasts, often with a tendency to be overdeveloped&quot; (Morris, 1953). In actuality however, some CAIS women have large breasts while some have small breasts (Wisniewski et al., 2000), and we have no clear data that their breasts are in fact larger on average.

Some people regain all their hair, some regain none. If it&#039;s been ten years, though, I think you may be out of luck. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s common to regain more than a year or two worth of hair loss. HRT may not stop your hair loss at all, just look at the boomer trannies and IT&#039;S MA&#039;AMs who started late in life and probably had pretty high test before, the damage is already done. FtMs who detransition naturally produce E and they don&#039;t regain their lost hair either. Definitely a case of you want to start as early as possible.<br><br>If hair is all you care about though, you don&#039;t need E, and it probably shouldn&#039;t be anywhere near the top of the list of options. E inhibits hair loss as a side effect, the actual thing that stops hair loss is low testosterone. Higher E levels will dampen your T, that&#039;s how monotherapy works, but E will have other effects, including breasts, which is going to be a problem if you want to present as conventionally masculine. No, it&#039;s not as simple as &quot;I&#039;ll just bind if they get too big&quot;, you&#039;ll also get a different weight distribution and skin oils, people will notice, and binding isn&#039;t comfortably even with a smaller chest. <br><br>I suggest you do what the rich people do, get a hair transplant and take an antiandrogen. You can do the transplant in Thailand or Turkey or somewhere to save money on that (but it&#039;s still quite expensive, save up), and buy Chinese fina or Brazilian antiandrogen pills to selfmedicate. You don&#039;t have to be Elon to afford it. And yeah, Elon and the other rich people fighting hair loss are definitely messing with their hormones, just look closely at the pictures and you&#039;ll recognise elements they have in common with transitioning.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy.

It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH</span>", "time": 1671844491, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28880801, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:15:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28880465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28880465</a><br>Yeah, once i puncture it once and another when i flipped it over<br>Also, is otokonokopharma still alive?

Also check out https://transfemscience.org/article<wbr>s/transfem-intro/<br><br>The basics is, if you take any estrogen at all, you are going to develop breasts, which doesn&#039;t sound like something you&#039;re interested in. Heightened levels of estrogen will furthermore suppress your testosterone production, to the extent that a large dose (called estradiol monotherapy) can essentially block it entirely.<br>You can try taking only an antiandrogen (cypro will probably be the easiest and best option). You won&#039;t &quot;feminise&quot;, but you will &quot;de-masculinise&quot;. It&#039;ll kill your libido (it&#039;s literally chemical castration) and make erections very rare, but that&#039;s reversible if you just stop taking the medication. Over prolonged time it&#039;s going to cause brittle bones and other health issues associated with menopause, so bear that in mind and live healthy. Don&#039;t try to do this with bica, that one doesn&#039;t actually stop test production, just your body&#039;s ability to make use of it. All the leftover testosterone turns into estrogen and you&#039;ll grow tits.<br>Testosterone is the stuff that builds muscles, so without it you&#039;re going to build muscle at more or less the same rate a woman does, which is significantly slower, but you do keep any muscle you already have, and also your masculine bone structure. Even if you go full MtF HRT you&#039;ll be stronger than just about any natural female. If you keep up your exercise you won&#039;t lose muscle, but you may lose your appetite (or gain a lot of it), and you will find it difficult to build new muscle. <br><br>Needless to say, if you plan to have children, it&#039;s best to do that before you start messing with your hormones. And even if you don&#039;t want kids, at least go to a sperm bank. If in the future you change your mind, you&#039;ll be happy you did. In theory stopping the medication will eventually return your sperm count, but testicular atrophy is a case of better safe than sorry.", "time": 1671970922, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28898541, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:04:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "this is probably really stupid and weird but i just have to ask<br>is there any shred of a chance that going off hrt makes my fingertips more sensitive? i dont know its just after being off hrt for a few weeks they just feel so much more tingly even just washing my hands or like after just showering and not even for long. i dont know if ive memed myself into thinking this can even like be the cause but i swear it wasnt like this before. im not even that hairy atm and even when washing my freshly shaven face the tips still feel all weird afterwards<br>im probably just being dumb though", "time": 1671977089, "resto": 28875004}, {"no": 28898594, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:13:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28875004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28875004</a><br>can someone give me the argument against Dr. Powers/the Powers method?

It feels soft and vulnerable.<br><br>He projects to outward impression of a young man, stronger, wiser and more self-assured than a man his age (25) should be, and he probably is in much of his life, but he has been through many stressful times and living in the underbelly of the street frequently since fleeing Romania as a refugee two years ago. He seems to like me a lot. He snuggles comfortably against me. A significant part of him that needs shelter and rest and some strong arms to keep him safe. The warrior in him also wants to find a lover he can defend and nurture. A friend I know in Vancouver would say he has \u201cwolf\u201d energy \u2013 fiercely independent and wanting to mate once for life.

Every man knows the number of inches he&#039;s packing, but few know the volume of their balls. This is despite the fact that balls are arguably more important. It&#039;s the balls that give a man his strength and vigor, that give him the ability to pass on his genes which is his sole biological purpose, and which give him sharpness of mind and determination and drive.<br><br>Balls should be celebrated as much, if not more so than cocks, and yet here we are in a world that is almost entirely phallo-centric.<br><br>I find the idea that balls are so important and yet so forgotten to be fascinating. I find the idea of comparing balls with another man to be incredibly compelling. You vs them in a basic, primal competition.<br><br>As part of that fascination, I want to put together a photo series. What I&#039;m looking for are some volunteers to send me photos of their balls. But balls are notoriously difficult to objectively size.<br><br>So what I&#039;m asking is that you send through a photo of your balls with an American Quarter placed on them as a size reference. This will then be added to a scaled series.
