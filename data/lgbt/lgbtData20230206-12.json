I have a small number of undershirts I wear but I usually like to wear a dress shirt (either black or white) as my undershirt. Most of my overshirts are either horror themed, have a cute design, or have anime women on them. Sometimes Ill style red/black or white/black arm warmers as an undersleave if im not wearing a dress shirt. I usually wear some cheap kate spade jewelry that my mom gave me or at most 1 chocker. I almost always wear a black belt with chains attached. As for bottoms, Ill either wear one of a handful of skirts or a pair of black slacks. If im wearing a skirt, I usually wear a pair of thigh highs with 1-2 pairs of garters; the thigh highs are usually black with maybe a a little bit of white or red stripes at the top. but i do have a pair with really cute demon horns on them. Ill also maybe wear some fishnets underneath. I usually go for an egirl or grungy style of make up. Heavy blush or eyeshadow, crazy ass eyeliner, maybe fake freckles.I still need to buy some mascara. I also curl my hair inwardly in a way that frames my faace nicely, and color correct my face as necessary. As for shoes, rn I have a pair of black and white adias that I rock, but im saving up for a pair of converse and some surplus army jungle boots. When I low effort mode Ill usually throw on a pair of blue jeans, and a graphic tee and black flannel combo. <br><br> Im about 160 5&#039;11 and ive just found this style naturally complements my body measurments. I girl mode 24/7 and generally get treated like a woman in my day to day life. I live in a smaller city with a pretty tightknit alternative scene so most people see me as a woman.

Sex, i believe, is roughly a form of primitive communication between people. Its violent by nature, but that doesn&#039;t mean its inherently bad, but it does mean a dom is enforcing their desires on the sub, and the sub&#039;s consent, present or not, is irrelevant. Its a power struggle, of the dom TAKING what they want from the sub, enforcing their position as dominant, punishing noncompliance with pain or rewarding compliance with pleasure. Again, this is NOT inherently bad. Consent and noncompliance can coexist in kinks. But its visceral. Every moment of real sex is a fight and the reward is pleasure. Two or more bodies are competing to see who can derivve the most pleasure from the other in a consensual scenario, either physical or psychological. You ask me if a 16 or 18 year old is ready for all that? You&#039;re nuts. <br><br>Its not perfect, but its the closest i have to what the real nature of sex is, inshort, a violent (not inherently bad) form of competition and communication.", "time": 1675643556, "resto": 29480788}, {"no": 29484724, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)19:33:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29484707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29484707</a><br>possibly creeps, sure, not borderline pedophiles, it&#039;s a whole different thing, at least where i live. pedos would be if they were outside the elementary school with a camera", "time": 1675643635, "resto": 29480788}, {"no": 29484726, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)19:34:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29484716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29484716</a><br>ok im getting turned on, need to get manhandled right now", "time": 1675643649, "resto": 29480788}, {"no": 29484747, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)19:35:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;autistic people can never have sex</span>", "filename": "descarga (1)", "ext": ".png", "w": 193, "h": 262, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675643743940386, "time": 1675643743, "md5": "tEvaUlxqzZGukkFFxQ/lZw==", "fsize": 5811, "resto": 29480788}, {"no": 29484749, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)19:36:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29484707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29484707</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mUh NoRmAl PeOpLe</span><br>You&#039;re on the gay tranny board.

Not to mention all the actual paid up assets they have embedded god knows where. <br>Scholz and Merkel are getting shit for accepting the fact that they NEED (not WANT) Russian gas. Cheap Russian gas has allowed Germany to be Europe&#039;s only export economy. But the German citizens have stopped thinking about acting in their own state&#039;s interests, and it doesn&#039;t occur to them that Americans literally always think in their state&#039;s interests because they are global hegemon and Russian gas, strong EU, non-Russian/neutral Ukraine or whatever is counter to their interests.

The pipeline being there is an incentive for the EU to uncuck itself. Russia would end up agreeing to almost anything to put a firm wedge between the EU and USA. Also the whole area of the explosion was crawling with US Navy. It&#039;s just denial of reality to pretend it wasn&#039;t them.<br>Another problem with the EU is that it is fixated on a regulated market to solve everything unless it&#039;s a matter of national security. This in practice just leeches workers from the poorer states to the south and east, keeping them underdeveloped, and lowers wages in West Europe. These idiots have created a system where they&#039;re shitting and farting about having to get the Chinese to build stuff because it&#039;s cheaper while cucking themselves out of whole portions of the EU being unemployed. But you can&#039;t say create an arrangement where the Greeks work for less but tax free in an EU funded factory to help pay off their ginormous debt and get the economy started again, because a factory in Berlin or Paris may not be able to compete.<br>Unfortunately its history as a bulwark against communism has pretty much meant that the laws that were on the books before German reunification prevents EU states from engaging in anything like a dirigiste state capitalism which is ideal for these underdeveloped areas ultimately because it will put capitalists in the core countries at risk, and the elites of the core like the dynamics I already mentioned anyway. <br>And they all love to say &quot;We need to stop entwining our economy with China/Russia&quot; but you never hear them say it about America.

Its way more socially acceptable to be a femme gay than even a post op tranny unless you are stealth. The straight guy fetish argument has more validity than the social stigma for homosexual argument. And that can always just have the goalposts moved to be called meta attraction that u want your femininity validated by men. So the dichotomy is pretty useless since it cannot discretely sort between the two easily. Also traditional AGPs, MEFs, self-loathing homosexuals, etc are all transitioning younger which will make your final result of transitioning a lot more feminine than what people of the past would have experienced.<br><a href=\"#p29488322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488322</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;y;know... man issue, what else?</span><br>what?<br><a href=\"#p29488339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488339</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;talk to a cs major</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask them what they work in/on</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they can&#039;t answer</span><br>yep.... thats a wasted education<br>i have to code for one of my classes and the teacher doesnt even teach the language we&#039;re just expected to pick it up on our own without problems.", "filename": "(6155)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675665035162287, "time": 1675665035, "md5": "eqcwnShujNeedptPOdQm6A==", "fsize": 121919, "resto": 29487862, "trip": "!iloveyouaw"}, {"no": 29488359, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:31:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29488351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488351</a><br>wow laf looks great there!", "time": 1675665062, "resto": 29487862}, {"no": 29488364, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29488355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488355</a><br>im always upset due to man issue is what", "time": 1675665124, "resto": 29487862}, {"no": 29488369, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:33:01", "name": "grendel", "com": "<a href=\"#p29488364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488364</a><br>why did you write that response to my post? im trying not to be a petulant whining doomer atm and so please dont try to trigger my nasty narcissistic habits.", "time": 1675665181, "resto": 29487862, "trip": "!iloveyouaw"}, {"no": 29488377, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:34:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29488369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488369</a><br>sorry misclicked", "time": 1675665291, "resto": 29487862}, {"no": 29488382, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:35:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29488334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29488334</a><br>That&#039;s honestly fine, too.

I think it&#039;s in part a symptom of LGBT culture and associated brainworms going mainstream. Historically homosexuals (mainly gays (male)) were (and I suppose still are) accused of being pedophiles and grooming/raping children, and more recently trans women have been accused of the same. In an effort to be one of the good ones, pickmes of every flavor of the rainbow vehemently deny being pedos and go out of their way to call out age gaps (even between consenting adults). You can throw feminists in the mix who notice how common age gaps between men and women are and try to use that as ammo against men (even though those gaps are explained by the fact that men mature physically, mentally, socially, financially much later than women).
