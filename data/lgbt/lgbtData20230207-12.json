When you tell me to refer to you as &quot;she/her&quot; you are telling me to see a woman when I look at you. I don&#039;t. I see your receding hairline, I see your broad shoulders, I see your thin hips, I see your gut and sinking cheeks and wide stubble, I see your fashion sense that reeks of male sensibilities, I see your taste in anime that reeks of somebody with a porn addiction, I see your imitation based on what men find attractive, but more than this I see male aggression. I see the demand to dominate. I see acts of assertion and imperialist reeducation. You demand that I tell you 2+2=5 and when I refuse you become angry, aggressive, and seek my removal or destruction. You are bullies who want to assert yourselves over others but have no field in which you&#039;re competitive except in social manipulation. You demand female spaces, you demand female aesthetics, you even demand the female label. You take even this from the women from which you wish you could take love and acceptance. You have gone beyond incel. You have entered into thievery and barbarism. Pastiche. Fraud. Imitation. Ersatz. You are dishonest, inauthentic, and aggressive. You are not, will never, can never, and should never be a woman. You are the aggressor in every space, turning the conversation towards your hatred of the penis and leg hair, towards your lust for the female. Your insistence on being called a woman is your demand to be given the girlfriend you were denied through your roleplaying as that imaginary woman.

full ductal development and moderate lobuloalveolar development of the breasts from a histological standpoint.[132][133][134] The study also found that, in contrast, treatment of transgender women with estrogen and CPA (which is progestogenic in addition to antiandrogenic, unlike NSAAs) resulted in full lobuloalevolar development, as well as pregnancy-like breast hyperplasia in two of the subjects.[132][134] In addition, it was observed that the lobuloalveolar maturation reversed upon discontinuation of CPA after sex reassignment surgery in these individuals.[132] It was concluded that progestogen in addition to antiandrogen/estrogen treatment is required for the induction of full female histological breast development (i.e., that includes complete lobuloalveolar maturation), and that continued progestogen treatment is necessary to maintain such maturation.[132][133] It should be noted however that although these findings may have important implications in the contexts of lactation and breastfeeding, epithelial tissue accounts for approximately only 10% of breast volume (with the bulk of the breasts (80\u201390%) being represented by stromal or adipose tissue),[135][136][137][138] and it is uncertain to what extent, if any, that development of lobuloalveolar structures (a form of epithelial tissue) contributes to breast size and/or shape.[122]</span>", "time": 1675721873, "resto": 29481973}, {"no": 29496803, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)17:21:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com":

Today I heard a sermon by John MacArthur on Psalm 107 that Im sure will answer your question if you open your heart. I think maybe I&#039;ve heard this sermon thru the Holy Spirit with a purpose of answering OPs question.<br>9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.<br><br>10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;<br><br>11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<br><br>12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.<br><br>13 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.<br><br>14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.<br><br>15 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>My personal reflection on this Psalm is that suffering is necessary to transform the lead of your soul into gold. Once this job is done the suffering ceases.

Like, you&#039;re saying how you really wish you were a woman, but the idea of it feels wrong. I think it&#039;s just because of conditioning put on you by society. Even not just explicitly, but also implicitly, it&#039;s part of the machinations of our society to try to enforce gender roles to some extent and it&#039;s also a taboo to step out of your gender role in terms of behavior, let alone to physically change your body to be like the opposite sex.

In my mid to late thirties I finally began to realize there was some chance that I was suffering from dysphoria induced depersonalization rather than autism, and that HRT might help.

I was able to start passing to cis normies quite quickly into my transition and rarely ever get misgendered in public.

I basically lucked out in that there is a tall ship nearby me which I already kind of knew about, but the general safe bet is to look at nearby cities and ports, check any larger tall ship races, and generally just ask around. A lot of people know someone who knows someone who&#039;s on this boat etc. Also military organs and coastal schools sometimes have tall ships as training boats and since the community is small you might be able to reach out and see if they know any nearby ships. <br><br>Just beware that small boat sailing and being a youngman on a tall ship are two very different beasts; some theoretical knowledge carries over and having your sea legs always pays off, but the actual skillsets are very different.

If people in your area do it, well what are the vibes you give off? Being pretty isn&#039;t everything, boys made sure never to sit next to me but were okay sitting next to other girls, but I likely had the wrong vibes even as a very cute and pretty woman. If you seem awkward and slouched, you might come across as unapproachable. In any case, whether it is you live in an introverted culture or you aren&#039;t pretty enough or you don&#039;t look approachable enough, you can always be the one who approaches guys. The truth is that only women who are both attractive and approachable/outgoing-looking get so easily approached by guys to the level of just being approached by randoms on the street. I know men make it sound like every woman gets that experience but that is so untrue. And honestly even then, most of the hot approachable girls are getting approached in contexts where there are low-inhibition extroverted guys, like in bars.

I have a small number of undershirts I wear but I usually like to wear a dress shirt (either black or white) as my undershirt. Most of my overshirts are either horror themed, have a cute design, or have anime women on them. Sometimes Ill style red/black or white/black arm warmers as an undersleave if im not wearing a dress shirt. I usually wear some cheap kate spade jewelry that my mom gave me or at most 1 chocker. I almost always wear a black belt with chains attached. As for bottoms, Ill either wear one of a handful of skirts or a pair of black slacks. If im wearing a skirt, I usually wear a pair of thigh highs with 1-2 pairs of garters; the thigh highs are usually black with maybe a a little bit of white or red stripes at the top. but i do have a pair with really cute demon horns on them. Ill also maybe wear some fishnets underneath. I usually go for an egirl or grungy style of make up. Heavy blush or eyeshadow, crazy ass eyeliner, maybe fake freckles.I still need to buy some mascara. I also curl my hair inwardly in a way that frames my faace nicely, and color correct my face as necessary. As for shoes, rn I have a pair of black and white adias that I rock, but im saving up for a pair of converse and some surplus army jungle boots. When I low effort mode Ill usually throw on a pair of blue jeans, and a graphic tee and black flannel combo. <br><br> Im about 160 5&#039;11 and ive just found this style naturally complements my body measurments. I girl mode 24/7 and generally get treated like a woman in my day to day life. I live in a smaller city with a pretty tightknit alternative scene so most people see me as a woman.

If I had to attribute my ability to focus on drawing for long periods of time to any one thing, it would be my environment. Setup your drawing environment to be the coziest safe haven you never want to leave unless you absolutely have to. No matter how absurd or how lazy it makes you seem.<br>Personally I HATE sitting at a desk. When I try to sit at my desk to draw like a normal human being I can&#039;t do it for longer than 30 minutes before getting restless or distracted. So what did I do? I grabbed a nice drink, propped up my pillows, grabbed a blanket, turned on some music or a comfort show, then sat up in bed with my laptop + tablet and got to drawing. If you can practice whatever skill you&#039;re interested in within an environment that brings you comfort, you begin to associate that activity with comfort. Before long you crave it because it brings you peace because it means it&#039;s time to be in your happy place.<br>I&#039;ve had a lot of bad days drawing, but whenever I think back to the good days they almost always involve me reminiscing about that one time I could lay in bed from 5pm to 5am making drawthread deliveries while watching my favorite anime.<br>That said of course, do be sure to take breaks to stretch/exercise/take care of yourself. Not just for your health, but it&#039;s important to step away from your work so that you can come back to it with rested eyes to spot errors. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Team sports are the obvious option.
