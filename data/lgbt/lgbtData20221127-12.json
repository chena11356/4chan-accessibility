Not only does smoking diminish the otherwise well-established beneficial effects of estrogen on hot flashes and urogenital symptoms and its positive effects on lipid metabolism, i.e. by reducing cholesterol, but smoking also specifically reduces estrogen&#039;s ability to prevent osteoporosis. The reduction or loss of therapeutic efficacy is mainly caused by dose-dependently elevated hepatic clearance, partially in conjunction with lower estrogen levels, and has been demonstrated only with oral estrogen applications. This failure of therapeutic action should not be compensated for by increasing the dose in smokers as this might result in the production of toxic, even potentially mutagenic estrogen metabolites-compounds recently associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.<br><br>Source: https://pubmedncbi.nlm.nih dot gov/12608008/#:~:text=However%2C%20<wbr>it%20has%20been%20proven,efficacy%2<wbr>0of%20orally%20administered%20estro<wbr>gens.", "time": 1669569516, "resto": 28490636}, {"no": 28520568, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:21:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28520458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28520458</a><br>But what about female reference range?

My hero is Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. This is my take to the whole transgender thing:<br><br>First off, Terfs are right. You aren&#039;t women. Second off, as rational people that believe in science, we should also aproach transgender women rationally and using evidence and liberal ethics. For instance, Im not a proponent of throwing men with tits to get raped in prisons. For instance, no man is homosexual for being attracted to passing trans women: they are equivalent to women phenotipically except for the tiny shrivelled peepee. And trans women aren&#039;t to be denied access to hormones. Both psychiatry and medicine show these are good for their mental state. Lastly, even if you were &quot;mentally ill men&quot; (which I don&#039;t necessarily agree with) this doesn&#039;t mean we get to lobotomize you as a treatment: we ought to stand for individual freedom to determine our life projects.

This means plastic surgery. Every single trans woman needs plastic surgery, I dont care how young you started or how much better you think you are from other women on this board because you started at 13. Being beautiful is how you take control of things in this life and get people to do things for you. Society sees you as more valid if you are more passable. If you cant afford plastic surgery then do SW or just work harder. It\u2019s very important. PS is a lifelong commitment. If you need silicone pump then get it just get small amounts over time for scar tissue to form around it, life is too short. Confidence is key and getting surg helps that immensely.<br><br>continued\u2026", "filename": "FA43A2EB-97B0-4E80-A82B-1C9F8CEB271F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 960, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669507762772378, "time": 1669507762, "md5": "4QtBuWNXinkgUdszHc4ZfQ==", "fsize": 157012, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "there-are-lots-of-babytrans-on-this-board-and-i", "replies": 87, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 82, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 28518421, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)08:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28516116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28516116</a><br>am reminded thankyo", "time": 1669557092, "resto": 28511428}, {"no": 28518982, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)10:00:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28518342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28518342</a><br>Yes it is a lifelong commitment and needs to be maintained.

Passing is exclusively determined by the general public&#039;s view on you. Let me be real with you, a tranny&#039;s opinion on passing? Less than worthless. I wouldn&#039;t piss on it if it was on fire. This is a cishet world, the rest of us just get to live in it, to even demand anything else would be a complete lack of humility and common sense. Transitioning serves one purpose and one purpose alone: to not want to make you sui as much as you did before transitioning. Passing only serves one thing: for you to integrate into society at large in a way that makes you comfortable. If passerby and strangers don&#039;t clock you, this is all you can expect from passing. It is all there is to it. Bitterhons, seething family members and terfoids that know you are a tranny shitting on you? That&#039;s not the fault of passing, that is the fault of whatever lightning strike did not hit those cunts.

Very pre modern internet times. Was extremely autistic and also schizophrenic but like. In a regularly mentally ill way not in an annoying attention seeking Tumblr/tiktok person way. Anyway he is the most wonderful dude. Cis, straight and just very very funny and normal and cool. Didn&#039;t use his disability as a crutch and genuinely did kinda hurt him when people used the R word. Not even like in an attention seeking leftie way. Like he just genuinely had a lot of trauma from being mentally ill and treated like shit. <br>Anyway he went through a shit tonne of abuse from his shitty dad. And eventually developed a system to cope, not even intentionally. I didn&#039;t know what it was back then, he didn&#039;t really know what it was he just described it as there being different aspects to his personality up there and sometimes one would take over and stuff. <br>And like. I have been around legitimately annoying people before. Actual fucking losers, genuine whiny pieces of attention seeking shit. But this guy was just a normal dude who happened to just be seriously mentally ill. And the way he handled his mental illness and didn&#039;t let it get in the way of his life was fucking beautiful. He&#039;s got a good job now, a wife (cis) and they&#039;re saving up for a downpayment on a house and looking to have kids soon. They&#039;ve got a dog. He&#039;s got hobbies and friends. <br>And yeah he just outperforms like, every single fucking loser who identifies so strongly with their mental health shit that I&#039;ve ever met in my life. While being like. Profoundly more mentally ill. <br>He literally just gets on with it. He doesn&#039;t pathologize the system, he just works with it cause he can&#039;t change that that&#039;s how his brain functions now.
