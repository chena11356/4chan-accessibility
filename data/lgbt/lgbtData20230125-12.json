But at the same time I think men enjoy it more when they do succeed. Maybe it&#039;s because they had to work so fucking hard for it. Women, especially pretty ones just get used to the handouts. Anyway, in some part you can tell the demands go fuck themselves. If you gain more power and status as a man you gain more freedom to do however the fuck you please.

I think you&#039;re a guy who wants to be emotional. Everyone, and by that I mean everyone, has a certain amount of wanting to be vulnerable and intimate. Some people have a lot of it, others not so much. You happen to be a male (read: human being with a cock) who has those feminine tendencies. That&#039;s okay. You *do* have the need for gender roles to go away, because you&#039;re a more effeminate male, instead of the &quot;emotionless, stoic, and plain&quot; male. It might be that you&#039;ve fallen victim to the collective trauma males have in which they&#039;re expected to be providers and not human beings with feelings and emotions, and you&#039;re overcompensating for that by wanting a lot of intimacy and vulnerability. All of this is okay.<br><br>What&#039;s not okay, on the other hand, is changing who you are, whether it&#039;s physical or cognitive/mentally or even hormonally because the world around you doesn&#039;t accept the way you are. If you want to start dealing with this, accept yourself the way you are, and start acting like it. If there&#039;s others that reject you for being who you are, then you should reject them for not letting you be who you want to be. Because after all, it&#039;s the &#039;you&#039; who you feel comfortable with, right?<br><br>Once you&#039;re comfortable with yourself, in- and outside and all, then you&#039;ll be able to add other people to your life who will appreciate you for who you are.<br><br>If you genuinely feel you&#039;re a *woman*, i.e. you&#039;re not an effeminate male, then by all means transition. But make sure you understand the difference and which one you are *very* carefully before you try to change who you are into something you might not want to be.<br><br>That&#039;s my two cents.

He&#039;s at least a solid 7.5/10, age 26, 5&#039;10, pretty nerdy, and he was also brought up on the old school internet/chans so we have some chemistry in association with old and obscure memes/board culture.<br>We started going on dates, chilling at each other&#039;s place on our days off within the past month or so. It can go from casual conversations and memeing, to him passionately making out with me, kissing me up and down my body, teasing and vice versa, then getting railed until I&#039;m shaking/moaning, and cuddling/spooning afterward until we fall asleep. He says sweet things to me that make my blood boil almost as if he&#039;s trying to make me catch feelings. I&#039;m trying to hold my composure and stay rational to avoid catching feelings in case something were to go wrong in foresight. <br><br>But over text he&#039;s so stale and it seems like he has no interest aside from him asking when we can chill next. Somewhat flirtatious, but he&#039;s so vague. <br>What does this imply? I&#039;m fine with fwb and am capable of avoiding catching feelings, but something feels off. Are some men just like this?

The issue is that you aren&#039;t used to using the muscles consciously, so you need some kind of shortcut to teach your brain how to use them. Examples are this: http://lena.kiev.ua/voice/ and this: https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice<wbr>/comments/7r5ekb/lookin_for_some_la<wbr>rynx_lift_clarification/dsuomke/<br>There are more out there, but they all teach the same thing, so keep trying until you get one that works. This will increase your voice&#039;s resonance, but it&#039;ll take months of regular use before it stops sounding forced and unnatural and becomes something you can do for a sustained period of time.<br>2: practice for months. The easiest way is to do it in conversation with other people. Your biggest obstacle here is burnout, and conversations solve this by keeping you from getting bored and keeping you from listening to the sound of your cringe unpracticed trannyvoice for hours at a time. Try to just have conversations with other troons (or cis people you trust not to judge you). And remember, your voice sucking now doesn&#039;t make you masculine, it&#039;s just a step in the process.

The United States, in order to counter the Soviet imperialism, used its soft power and intelligence apparatus to push nations away from communism by either funding or aiding anti-communist groups. This is no different than what the Soviet Union was doing - it was funding all the Communist aligned groups in the United States and Latin America. In fact, the US had to execute their spies - who sold nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union.
