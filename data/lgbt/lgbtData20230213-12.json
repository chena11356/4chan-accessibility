Trump says &quot;LGBTQ&quot; at Republican convention. Encountered a lot of especially younger people who expressed a feeling of optimism for a new paradigm in which these culture war issues might no longer dominate the political conversation. Trans issues are far down the list of hot button news items. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2023</span><br>Culture wars are inescapable and no one can stop talking about trannies. RW memes have devolved into trannyjaks and spamming YWNBAW. The incel-to-trans pipeline idea balloons from a 4chan urban legend in 2017 to being publicly discussed on mainstream platforms. Harry Potter has gone from being employed in liberal and leftist rhetoric so frequently as to become a meme to being aggressively boycotted over trans issues. Trans girls in women&#039;s restrooms are treated like the most critical issue of the day and painted as monsters and creeps by mainstream conservative media.<br><br>What happened? I feel very sad about the way that public discourse has narrowed so radically in fewer than ten years. It&#039;s like this little window opened up and these weird possibilities of political heterodoxy emerged, and then just as rapidly, it slammed shut, and now everyone has &quot;gender ideology&quot; in their vocabulary and a culture war poison pill comes with every position. Political participation has become effectively unconscionable for me and it just seems like reasonable discourse on especially trans issues has just died a cruel death while simultaneously drowning out other issues.

The main instigating catalyst in Europe was an intersection of the failures of pluralism, European integration, and neocon bellicosity over the war in Syria, which collided all at once in 2015. Trump&#039;s signature issues were immigration and trade. The right&#039;s *successes* in this period were based precisely on issues unrelated to the culture wars. Since then, the right has stagnated, if anything, as conservatives and the far right alike lose their minds over bathrooms. I believe you&#039;re quite right to say that it&#039;s a losing fight; it&#039;s not only based on falsehoods but no more practicable in the long run than any other culture war battle that conservatives have lost in the past fifty years. But there is no reason to think that the right needed to fight this battle in the first place, or that it has been useful to them in the past ten years.

For the left, this means something like people who secretly have hateful and genocidal plans, while for the right it&#039;s more like people seeking to justify their violence and criminality. There&#039;s some validity to this, but it has a corollary: just as the naivety of good faith dialogue can attract bad actors who use it as a cover, the cynicism of the radical is attractive to others because it offers a justification for their desire for violence and cruelty. And it&#039;s very difficult to tell the difference.

The issue is with stress tolerance, for instance, I was a very normal happy child. I had a very good childhood, I wasn&#039;t mentally ill, I hadn&#039;t gone through any trauma, and I had one of the best childhoods on the planet. I was a very lucky and privileged person growing up, but starting at the age of 12 years old, things were going downhill. I started isolating myself in my room, I wasn&#039;t talking to my friends anymore. I was slowly becoming a social recluse who didn&#039;t talk to anyone and sat on my computer all day 24/7 browsing the internet. But I wasn&#039;t fully there yet, I also started getting very uncomfortable about touching other people. But overall, I was still doing okay. But then at the age of 13, my anxiety started getting worse and worse and by mid-2016, I had full-blown anxiety disorder 24/7 non-stop, there is no way to articulate how terrible my anxiety was. I would give John 50 a run for his money at the age of 13 years old with how bad my anxiety is. Essentially I had a condition known as haphephobia, which is the fear of touching others or of being touched. I feared that if I touched another human being in an inappropriate area, this would make me a rapist piece of shit who deserves to die. This was something that I was extremely afraid of, like if I had gone to wal-mart and if there was a person that was say, 100 feet away from me. If for instance, I had my hand and lifted my index slightly upwards, I would be deeply afraid if I had accidentally touched the person 100 feet away from me and then I would tell myself that since I had accidentally touched them, this means that I&#039;m a rapist and that I am irredeemable and unforgivable as a human being, so I should take my own life. cont.", "filename": "66f-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 763, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676286268692984, "time": 1676286268, "md5": "xTd57zs0tKV7LerbyxVf/A==", "fsize": 34208, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-was-john-50-at-the-age-of-13-years-old-and-im", "replies": 13, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 29592226, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)06:05:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29592216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29592216</a><br>If I had to leave the store, I would sit there and it might take me some minutes because of all of the people coming out and coming into the store that I would have to avoid touching to not be a bad person who sexually assaults others. I had to deal with this every day 24/7 non-stop, I became an agoraphobe and somebody who was avoidant of my family because I didn&#039;t want to rape them. This is only one of the things I&#039;ve had to go through in my life, and this was at the age of 13. But, if you think that is bad, from 14-17 my life and my anxiety, were only getting worse and worse, and I was slowly transforming into an evil human being. Yet even as I had significantly masculinized during my puberty, probably more so than most people in my age group, I had still decided to repress my gender dysphoria, and I was successful. Eventually, at the age of 17, I developed extremely severe insomnia, suddenly out of nowhere, so I don&#039;t feel any emotions or anything anymore, so I&#039;m pretty fine now and am not non-stop suffering from constant non-stop mental torture 24/7 never-ending. Even though my life isn&#039;t as bad now as it was back then, I was capable for years as a child, of repressing, and I was successful at it.

Thanks for the nice words and feedback tho. Ive noticed that if a you take a person and say theyre nb or a femboy people will notice the more female traits they have where as if you say youre a tranny/woman people will be more critical and pick out the things that clock you for some reason. Like if you present as a feminine man youre still in the male genre so your female traits are what sticks out. Where as a trans woman has the opposite. I think I gotta use that to mu advantage.

As a trans girl, she faced many challenges and obstacles, but she was determined to live her truth no matter what. One day, while browsing a small shop, Emma came across a blue plushie shark that immediately caught her eye. She couldn&#039;t resist the adorable creature and brought it home with her, naming it &quot;Blahaj&quot;. At first, Emma was content to just cuddle with Blahaj and enjoy its company, but as time went on, she found herself confiding in the plushie shark about her struggles and triumphs as a trans girl. It was as if Blahaj had become her closest confidant and the perfect companion to share all of her deepest thoughts and feelings with. But things took a turn for the romantic when Emma met Rachel, a kind and compassionate young woman who was also trans. Rachel and Emma hit it off right away, and they soon found themselves falling in love. Their relationship was full of cute and adorable moments, from sweet kisses and cuddles to playful jokes and games. Emma struggled to find a way to include Blahaj in their lives, but Rachel was completely understanding and even suggested that they take Blahaj on their first date. The three of them had a wonderful time, with Blahaj joining in on all the fun and laughter. As their relationship continued to grow and deepen, Emma, Rachel, and Blahaj formed a beautiful and unique family. They were each other&#039;s biggest supporters and cheerleaders, and their love for one another only grew stronger with each passing day. They even started speaking to each other in &quot;uwu&quot; furryspeak, adding an extra layer of cuteness to their already adorable relationship.
