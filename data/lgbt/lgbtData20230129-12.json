I only really need to take the ralox for a few years, until I have the means to afford top surgery. My main fear is that hair loss seems to be a notable side effect of serms (less so ralox than tamoxifen), and I keep finding conflicting reports about whether or not they would actually cause hair loss in someone who&#039;s on hrt. I know that ralox increases testosterone, I guess I&#039;m just wondering if the reason for reported hair loss on serms is due to the increase in testosterone levels, or if it&#039;s caused by another mechanism entirely. If so, would an aa that directly lowers test levels (such as cypro) prevent hairfall from ralox? I started hrt about 2 months ago; I noticed a lot of shedding right after starting but I assume that was due to the stress it was putting onto my body, as the hair that did shed started growing back about a week later.

There&#039;s no possible reality where me transitioning ends up well. I can&#039;t say I have fully accepted that but I know it isn&#039;t going to change and ultimately it&#039;s the fact I come back to every time there are any cracks in the armor.<br><br>Along with acceptance I think there are some little things you can allow yourself to give you a little bit of feminine expression in your life. The way I act when I&#039;m alone is rather different from how I act when I&#039;m around other people. I also don&#039;t think you have to consider your male body your enemy. You can have pride in your fitness and how you look if you take care of yourself. Men&#039;s fashion isn&#039;t as fun but I think it can still give you somewhat of an outlet. Being a well-dressed man can be rewarding in a way that most men never get because they never try. I guess what I&#039;m trying to get at is that you need the find the things you can enjoy despite everything.

It&#039;s hard for me to believe that God isn&#039;t just fucking with me and wants me to have the worst life possible. I overdosed seroquel but when I finished taking the pills and then I tried putting my bottle on the desk next to my bed, it fell down to the ground. Afterwards, I went to the bathroom and my parents went into my room and saw my empty pill bottle on the ground If 30 seconds had passed, I would probably be dead right now.

I believe this is just my natural biological role and I&#039;m stuck living like this for the next 60 years of my life or so. God will not allow me to commit suicide, I am too much of a pussy to end my life, even though I know with 100% certainity that it will never get better and that I objectively have every good reason to do so. If I was rational, I would end it right now, but my lizard-brain is too cowardly and weak. All I can do is rot and suffer living an inferior existence for 50 more years until I die.

As hard as it is, you need to just come out to her. It&#039;s going to save you so much pain in the long run and she might even be accepting. I&#039;ve had tranny feelings since I was like 5 too and I&#039;ve repeatedly wished I was a girl and considered transitioning ever since I found out it was a thing and I&#039;m very attracted to men but I forced myself to live as a heterosexual cis man and do mental gymnastics to convince myself I&#039;m not trans or attracted to men. I&#039;ve had outward success, like I got up to about half a PhD before dropping out and I have a pretty good career and a house and a car and a cute girlfriend that I&#039;m like best friends with. Internally though, I&#039;ve always been a total wreck. I think I&#039;ve been dissociated and detached from reality and off and on depressed and all kinds of other fun stuff since puberty, and that&#039;s about the time I started sporadically abusing substances too. It got really bad in my early 20&#039;s and I was straight up addicted to hard drugs to cope with everything. I&#039;m just about your age too. But yeah I got sidetracked. Anyways, once I started admitting to myself that what I feel means I&#039;m kinda bi and trans, I knew I couldn&#039;t just hide it from my girlfriend so I told her. It was one of the hardest things I ever did but she is really supportive and is okay with it if I decide to transition. She even like gets excited to do makeup with me and look at outfits with me and stuff and she&#039;s been treating me a little more like a woman and I think we&#039;re closer than ever after I shared such a major and secret part of myself. I&#039;m not saying it will work that way for you or anything but it was the biggest relief in the world to get that off my chest and not feel like I&#039;m alone and hiding something anymore. I&#039;m honestly probably going to end up snapping and transitioning because I feel that pressure cooker analogy hard, this is a lot to cope with.", "time": 1674969247, "resto": 29330279}, {"no": 29377655, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:37:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29377179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29377179</a><br>just be a gay man", "time": 1674970624, "resto": 29330279}, {"no": 29377786, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)00:52:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29377405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29377405</a><br>I&#039;m happy that it worked out for you.

Honestly it would probably be even more traumatic for everyone who loves you to see you go from seemingly happy and successful to dead by your own hand. I know the people in my life that I care about would rather see me trans or with a man than dead. It&#039;s going to be hell on people either way you try to get out of this and make the feelings stop, but one way is going to hurt them less. I felt really ashamed to come out to even one person, just my partner, and I was so scared for the worst and I ended up getting so much more love and support than I expected. Not everyone is going to be like that though. But seriously like just try living your life the way you want to live it before suicide. Sure, it&#039;s going to be hard and it&#039;s absolutely terrifying to the point where dying seems less scary but maybe once you rip the bandaid off it will be much better and you&#039;ll wonder what you were even worrying about. I know I personally do that with a lot of stuff in my head where I anticipate the worst and I am so scared that I&#039;m wishing I&#039;d die instead and then everything ends up being okay when it happens in reality. I&#039;ve been considering sui a lot lately too because of how much pain I&#039;m in and how scary this all is, but I decided that I don&#039;t want to die and that I don&#039;t want to put everyone through me dying. The mental image of how fucked up my loved ones would be by me offing myself scares me straight away from doing it even though the idea of dying instead of either coping with this or doing the unthinkably terrifying and transitioning feels comforting. I do really feel that huge crushing pressure though, this is a lot to cope with and honestly I&#039;m shocked I haven&#039;t done anything to make it stop yet.

I&#039;ve always been female and nothing and nobody can change that, which is why republicans and bigots are exceptionally ignorant. In my opinion as someone who has struggled with their identity for the last 25 years and only recently came to terms with embracing and accepting myself, find contentment with yourself first, find validation and love within yourself first before looking for validation from others. Who gives a fuck if Tommy down the street or Gretchen at the grocery store thinks you&#039;re a &quot;female now&quot; because you got a nose job or you took drugs. If you don&#039;t learn to accept and love yourself you&#039;ll never be true to yourself.

So that if you\u2019ve really been beating up the glutes with direct work for multiple mesocycles and they need a break, don\u2019t be afraid to remove all direct glute work for fear of losing gains\u2026 so long as you\u2019re doing some squatting, your newfound glutes shouldn\u2019t be going anywhere.<br><br>MEV = Minimum Effective Volume:<br>The minimum effective volume for most individuals is actually ZERO sets per week. But remember, that\u2019s sets of direct work. What this means is that most individuals will get SOME glute growth, even in the long term, from not even training glutes directly, but training quads and hams, and thus engaging the glutes significantly. If your desire is to grow your glutes more than their minimum potential, you\u2019ve got to train them more, and just letting them get their stimulus indirectly from other leg work is no longer enough.<br><br>MAV = Maximum Adaptive Volume:<br>The maximum adaptive volume of a single session of any trained muscle group is still speculative, but research suggests it\u2019s probably no lower than 4 working sets per session and no higher than 12 working sets per session in most intermediates. When you design your program and progressions, having lots of sessions with much fewer than 4 working sets per muscle group per session for multiple weeks on end might not be very efficient, and you might benefit from combining a few of these lower volume sessions to get the same volume but in fewer weekly sessions. Also, not exceeding 12 sets per session per muscle group for more than a few weeks is probably a good idea.<br><br>1/2", "filename": "FRcWK34XEAAObci", "ext": ".png", "w": 563, "h": 765, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674961654747666, "time": 1674961654, "md5": "0ig2MMINVVf04HxM0hcLoA==", "fsize": 1081676, "resto": 29374818}, {"no": 29376367, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:08:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29376352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29376352</a><br>MRV = Maximum Recoverable Volume:<br>Most people seem to encounter serious recovery problems above 12 sets per week of glute training when done with 2 weekly sessions. 3 session can raise this to 18 or so sets per week, 4x to 25 sets per week, and 5-6 sessions to near 30 sets per week. Mind you, this is ON TOP OF a full complement of quad work and hamstring work. It\u2019s worth noting that the exercises you choose to do for your glutes have a huge effect on your MRVs for them. Deadlift variations are incredible taxing, and may see your MRVs as low as 8-12 sets per week no matter the frequency. If you use mostly glute bridges and hip thrusts of various kinds, you\u2019re likely to see MRVs of double or even triple those values. Per set, such easier exercises are probably not as stimulative to glute growth, but they are so much less fatiguing that any serious program prioritizing glute growth will include a lot of hip thrusts and bridges of various kinds.<br><br>EXERCISES<br>Barbell Hip Thrust<br>Barbell Walking Lunge<br>Cable Pull-Through<br>Deadlift<br>Deficit 25\u2019s Deadlift<br>Deficit Deadlift<br>Dumbbell Walking Lunge<br>Machine Glute Kickback<br>Machine Hip Thrust<br>Reverse Lunge<br>Single Leg Hip Thrust<br>Split Squat<br>Sumo Deadlift<br>Sumo Deficit Deadlift<br>Sumo Squat<br>Trap Bar Deadlift<br>Dumbbell Reverse Lunge<br>Dumbbell Split Squat<br>Dumbbell Single Leg Hip Thrust<br>Wide Stance Belt Squat<br><br>playlist of exercises: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLyqKj7LwU2RtZnGDmtpyhDdvUHFvVyZ<wbr>nA<br><br>2/2", "filename": "1674120225605411", "ext": ".webm", "w": 900, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674961716152069, "time": 1674961716, "md5": "j4RGJ5JgKGjXhgK3uoZLdw==", "fsize": 676626, "resto": 29374818}, {"no": 29376379, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:10:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29376342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29376342</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A. https://rpstrength.com/hypertrophy-<wbr>training-guide-central-hub/</span><br>for your legs", "filename": "Capture2", "ext": ".png", "w": 747, "h": 650, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1674961817021577, "time": 1674961817, "md5": "kJfo1M2CKa7pw85nILijiQ==", "fsize": 40541, "resto": 29374818}, {"no": 29376411, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:13:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29374818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29374818</a><br>Wym those are normal thighs for a guy.
