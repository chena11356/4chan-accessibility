I would rather not go on a tangent since nobody here can read, but male socialization (as indicated by the name) basically just means how society socializes--trains up a child in the way they should go--people they perceive as male.

Specifically, gay men who identify with a recep-tive (i.e., bottom) anal sex role (ASR) tend to report greater gender nonconformity than gay men preferring an insertive (i.e., top) ASR. Thus, while both subgroups have a same-sex sexual orientation, they vary in their gender expression. Examination of other traits affected by sexual differentia-tion/androgen signalling suggests that gay men delineated by ASR also differ in androgen exposure. For instance, gay men with a bottom ASR present with a more female-typical digit ratio than tops, while gay men with a top ASR have an earlier pubertal onset, are taller, and have more body hair than ASR bottoms. Recalled childhood separation anxiety (a psychologi-cal trait with consistent sex differences, females &gt; males) is also greater among gay men with a bottom than a top

He doesn&#039;t make any appeals to God, Religion, Philosophy, Morality, Science, Reason etc. etc. When I was at my most suicidal, I wouldn&#039;t have given two shits if someone tried to convince me that &quot;Jesus would be sad&quot; or &quot;Your electromagnetic waves won&#039;t be in tune with the noosphere when your brain stops functioning.&quot; Maybe someone will find it refreshing to hear an argument for Life that accepts only what we know about the world, that it is cold and brutal. At the very least, maybe contemplating the ideas in the video will be a helpful mental exercise to keep your mind off worse thoughts.<br>It should be noted that, obviously, if you are feeling suicidal, please seek help from a phone call or professional.

The first is, at what is the functional distinction between &quot;bdd to look feminine that improves with physical feminization from HRT&quot; and gender dysphoria?<br><br>The second is that, if HRT femboys still had a male gender identity, things like growing breasts would be expected to cause them to become dysphoric. This is what is meant by &#039;reverse dysphoria&#039; if someone goes on the wrong HRT for their gender identity. Instead of being happy with the changes they get, any changes they get will make them feel bad and dysphoric because of the traits they are losing, which is exactly the opposite reaction to HRT that you&#039;re supposed to have.<br><br>We know this based on studies of intersex children and infants who had accidents that caused them to be sex reassigned by parents and doctors. Those children were then given hormones in puberty to make them have the puberty that matched the sex they&#039;d been assigned, and additionally, they were not told that this was being done to them.<br><br>What happened in cases where the assigned sex did not match the gender identity of those children is that the children usually intuitively figured out and expressed their true gender identity, and they experienced crippling dysphoria when they were forced to have the wrong puberty on enforced HRT, even though they didn&#039;t know that&#039;s what was being done to them. This body of research is one of the thing that underpinned the development of the informed consent standard for HRT because it showed that if someone goes on the wrong HRT for their gender identity, they will almost certainly voluntarily want to stop taking it well before it would carry significant health risks.<br><br>All of that is a long way of saying, if your gender identity isn&#039;t that of a woman, you generally will be pretty upset about growing breasts.", "time": 1673494251, "resto": 29139949}, {"no": 29145890, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)22:54:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29145650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29145650</a><br>I mean ya there probably isn&#039;t that big a difference of I&#039;m honest.

In Britain and America, the English-originating literary/cultural movement and group of writers known as the Uranians (1858-1930), including Oscar Wilde, Edward Carpenter, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Ralph Chubb, challenged anti-homosexual prejudice through writing on the subject of Ancient Greece or &quot;Greek Love&quot;: the love between older males and male youth (adolescents). The Uranian writer John Addington Symonds, inspired by &quot;gay&quot; (pederast) author Walt Whitman, is credited as being the 1st person to use the term &quot;homosexual&quot; in the English-language,[3] in his book A Problem in Greek Ethics, written in 1873 and privately printed in 1901. This work was the 1st to use the term &quot;boy-love&quot;, which were both considered as &quot;homosexual&quot; in the Uranian effort to defend and advocate for same-sex love. The American Uranian poet Edward Perry Warren also authored an early defence of same-sex love, in his 3-volume magnum opus (1928-1930), A Defence of Uranian Love. Der Eigene (1896-1932), the very first Gay Journal focused on pederastic writings and photography, and &quot;advocated classical pederasty as a cure for the moral flabbiness of German youth&quot;. Scans are available via Wikipedia.[4]<br><br>&quot;The issue of love between men and boys has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. [...] A few (Hans Bl\u00fcher, for example, famous for his book on the Wandervogel movement) believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state - a view that, in a perverted form, found a distorted expression in the militarism of the Hitler Youth.&quot;[5]", "filename": "300px-Haykiss1994 (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 207, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1673510235354668, "time": 1673510235, "md5": "dFpFlFcbTOd6Bzr6YqtMGg==", "fsize": 36364, "resto": 29148082}, {"no": 29148149, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)02:58:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29148128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29148128</a><br>I was one of those guys who forcefully dragged into sport events in schools soley by physical appearances.", "time": 1673510319, "resto": 29148082}, {"no": 29148152, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)02:58:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A 2021 journal issue entitled &quot;Restoring Intergenerational Dynamics to Queer History&quot;[6] reminds us that intergenerational love and eroticism represent an integral part of Queer history; before terms like &quot;homosexuality&quot; - once designating same-sex attraction - came to be redefined as referring to &quot;androphile&quot; or &quot;adults only.&quot; In her book on the once famous and influential pederast Norman Douglas (see book review), Historian Rachel Hope Cleves quotes from Queer historian Kadji Amin:<br><br>&quot;According to Amin, \u201cmodern pederasty,\u201d which he defines as age-differentiated sex, was the dominant form of male same-sex practice until the mid-twentieth century.

H. Mader survey the history of recorded male same-sex eroticism through surviving photography artwork.

Reflecting on the dire consequences of expansive definitions of &quot;child pornography,&quot;[8] which can include drawings, animation, and any material featuring real-life persons under 18 years of age even if they are not engaged in sexual activity or remotely naked, they note that the mere possession of much material they and other historians discuss has now become illegal - providing a justification to wield state-power to destroy gay history.

Are the transphobic views of politician&#039;s and terfs inspired by nazi ideology? </span><br>It is certainly a shared common background. The reason why the nazis hated trans people is because they threatened their idea of a conservative cultural identity, and a rise in trans visibility in the early 20th century, alongside the decline of germany, made them a cultural scapegoat, alongside was communism and jewish people. <br><br>In the modern day this is the exact same ideology. The right wing has a ideal of a conservative cultural tradition in america, trans people contradict that, america is failing so they have to blame it on someone.

In Britain and America, the English-originating literary/cultural movement and group of writers known as the Uranians (1858-1930), including Oscar Wilde, Edward Carpenter, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Ralph Chubb, challenged anti-homosexual prejudice through writing on the subject of Ancient Greece or &quot;Greek Love&quot;: the love between older males and male youth (adolescents). The Uranian writer John Addington Symonds, inspired by &quot;gay&quot; (pederast) author Walt Whitman, is credited as being the 1st person to use the term &quot;homosexual&quot; in the English-language,[3] in his book A Problem in Greek Ethics, written in 1873 and privately printed in 1901. This work was the 1st to use the term &quot;boy-love&quot;, which were both considered as &quot;homosexual&quot; in the Uranian effort to defend and advocate for same-sex love. The American Uranian poet Edward Perry Warren also authored an early defence of same-sex love, in his 3-volume magnum opus (1928-1930), A Defence of Uranian Love. Der Eigene (1896-1932), the very first Gay Journal focused on pederastic writings and photography, and &quot;advocated classical pederasty as a cure for the moral flabbiness of German youth&quot;.

Reflecting on the dire consequences of expansive definitions of &quot;child pornography,&quot;[8] which can include drawings, animation, and any material featuring real-life persons under 18 years of age even if they are not engaged in sexual activity or remotely naked, they note that the mere possession of much material they and other historians discuss has now become illegal - providing a justification to wield state-power to destroy gay history.

On the basis of his interviews, Vacha attributed this tendency &quot;not so much to preference as to their lack of hesitancy in entering into such age-segregated relationships. The stigma against these kinds of relationships does not appear to be as strong in the gay community as it is in society in general. Furthermore, the stereotype of the older man exchanging status, security and financial favor for the younger man&#039;s physical beauty did not hold up. Often, the older man did not have those worldly possessions to offer, suggesting that the relationship was less trade and barter in the presupposed sense.&quot; (pp. 217-218).<br><br>Homosexuality (including pederasty) remained illegal and strictly taboo until the liberation movements of the 60s.
