Is suffering a necessary part of the human condition? What would people who never suffered be like?</span><br><br>Great question. It really is. Today I heard a sermon by John MacArthur on Psalm 107 that Im sure will answer your question if you open your heart. I think maybe I&#039;ve heard this sermon thru the Holy Spirit with a purpose of answering OPs question.<br>9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.<br><br>10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;<br><br>11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<br><br>12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.<br><br>13 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.<br><br>14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.<br><br>15 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>My personal reflection on this Psalm is that suffering is necessary to transform the lead of your soul into gold. Once this job is done the suffering ceases. This can be achieved in a single lifetime once after one is saved with dedication and the blessing of the Lord and before one is saved thru the mercy of the Almighty once one has come to genuine contrition.", "time": 1675721602, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29496722, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)17:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Kek who deleted", "time": 1675721705, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29498120, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)18:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I need a sexy milf to spit on my pussy.", "time": 1675727718, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29498932, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)19:56:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want a tall strong woman to lift me into her arms.", "time": 1675731376, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29499021, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:02:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29498120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29498120</a><br><a href=\"#p29498932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29498932</a><br>I want an emo chick thats fixed her broken mentality but still likes metal shows.", "time": 1675731737, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29499107, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:08:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thoughts?", "time": 1675732092, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29499263, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:20:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29499021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29499021</a><br>I want a girl to lose her anal virginity with me.", "time": 1675732818, "resto": 29489032}, {"no": 29499591, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)20:50:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You ever dislike how conformist and cowardly most white women are?

I guess thats partially a natural protective older brother thing but i wont deny theres a bit of jealousy.<br><br>I really dont want to ruin our relationship or creep her out but im anxious because our parents keep suggesting we move into a studio apartment closer to college together when she graduates highschool this year so they can move our nana into our room.", "filename": "1674536127120", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 900, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675902773600279, "time": 1675902773, "md5": "77RdMDSgDiqQZKYYtmszNQ==", "fsize": 389103, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-kind-of-into-my-tranny-younger-sister-and-idk", "replies": 78, "images": 14, "unique_ips": 46}, {"no": 29528696, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:34:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528682</a><br>trans girls belong to their brothers", "time": 1675902849, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528699, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:34:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528682</a><br>she&#039;s 18 right? right? right?!!", "time": 1675902869, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528711, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:35:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528682</a><br>usually larps or pasta has better grammer, maybe this is real? if so, dude get you a gf fast. don&#039;t date your sister.<br><br>yes some guy will eventually fuck her, learn to accept this", "time": 1675902916, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528725, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528682</a><br>damn some people are retarded as fuck", "time": 1675902995, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528751, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528682</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I used to jack it to trap doujins a lot before she came out to me</span><br>hmmmm...", "filename": "1666046195142838", "ext": ".png", "w": 269, "h": 272, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675903121924434, "time": 1675903121, "md5": "jCAsCbCSV5kpUMclmzRKLg==", "fsize": 5936, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528753, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:38:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29528696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29528696</a><br>fpbp<br>she belongs to you OP. prove it to her", "time": 1675903129, "resto": 29528682}, {"no": 29528756, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:39:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You need to tell her she has to cover up now lol, dumbass.

Half of the sellers now have lists of countries that they don&#039;t ship to, and are working on basically a brew to order basis. if you&#039;re a homebrewer, unless you&#039;re in somewhere like Brazil or Ukraine it&#039;s a *when* rather than an *if* you get caught. all it takes really is for one of the big EU sellers to stop production and everything will be on fire again for a few months", "time": 1675905574, "resto": 29526571}, {"no": 29529288, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:23:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29526571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29526571</a><br>tbf it isnt uncommon for people to ban or enforce silly things to have a sense of control over things that they can actually have control over<br><br>its why many corporations treat their employees like criminals more than they do for actual thieving customers", "time": 1675905780, "resto": 29526571}, {"no": 29530949, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)22:59:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29529259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29529259</a><br>I just ordered my own powder from china, the uncertainty kills me.

Then move for a boycott on those after winning public good points, game sales mean shit honestly, studio gets shut down and that&#039;s it, merchandising however blows the fuckin ip up if it no longer sells. Instead, we went for culture war outrage, and the issue is, culture war outrage is dumb and only benefits the right wingers and reactionaries.

Based, good for you. Telling others you are disappointed in them for buying it? Stupid, retarded, what the fuck are you even expecting to accomplish with that? Making others feel bad over liking *thing* never worked and will never work. If anything imo enjoying the game as a trans person is a bigger act of defiance to JK imo, it shows just how ultimately unimportant she is to HP as a whole when she had fuck all to do with it and everyone is just enjoying the fuckin game. (that is if you actually like the game, don&#039;t force yourself to if you don&#039;t, it is a mixed game for people after all)<br><br>Like this game by itself is just as transphobic as CP2077, which it turned out to be not at all and twitter is just retarded. Heck cyberpunk had great troon representation, this not so much but it isn&#039;t transphobic, just not great representation, but you know JK is malding even over that. Bottom line imo is, brain rotted twitter users are retarded, regardless of political stance, and hopefully musk burns it down in another month or two together with his wealth.", "time": 1675935494, "resto": 29530943}, {"no": 29533301, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)04:41:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29530943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29530943</a><br>why do people want to play this game so badly? what&#039;s the allure? i don&#039;t get it. maybe i&#039;m just unable to understand because i prefer indie titles over triple A garbage most of the time, they have more soul to them", "time": 1675935677, "resto": 29530943}, {"no": 29533307, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)04:42:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29533287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29533287</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heck cyberpunk had great troon representation</span><br>like what?<br>I didn&#039;t play it so all I know is the &quot;try something different&quot; poster that implied trannies are not chicks", "time": 1675935738, "resto": 29530943}, {"no": 29533315, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)04:44:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29533287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29533287</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cyberpunk had great troon representation</span><br>the devs literally hate trannies and the &quot;trans rep&quot; in the game was a mockery", "time": 1675935863, "resto": 29530943}, {"no": 29533318, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)04:44:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29533301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29533301</a><br>Big ip that has a big formative impact on a lot of zoomers and millenials, and most have wanted to explore hogwarts in a video game and outside the lego games there wasn&#039;t really a game that did that well.

Like for pooners who know what they are doing and know how to leverage being trans, it can actually be a bit easier to find a gf and find high-quality female friends, compared to complete autistic basketcase cis moids. This applies even if the FtMs pass as men. Get those bisexual female orbiters and they will do emotional support and do emotional labor for you. But at the end of the day, and this applies to both sexes, you need to figure our own shit internally. Venting occasionally to your partner and your friends can help, because you know there are people who care about you and want you to be happy, but you don&#039;t want to be whining about the same shit constantly, and you can&#039;t expect to be fully understood. If I had to summarise all the advice I was given, it was simply &quot;go to the gym and have more sex&quot;.<br><br>When I was living as a woman, I was actually more ignored and misunderstood and treated with disgust than now, because people do that to women who don&#039;t fit in (if you don&#039;t fulfill the expectations of the womanhood, you don&#039;t get the perks, you get dismissed rather than coddled) and then I &quot;cried for help&quot; from all the wrong people. This is not a bait post for a thousand (You)s telling me amabs have it worse because they were beaten physically and then thrown into metaphorical death camps, this is just an aside that both gnc women and pooners need to learn social filtering anyway, as a gnc woman I already had zero friends and had schoolmates who physically avoided me and I have parents who now say they regretted emotionally ignoring me as a child.

It has been life-changing for me in so many ways! I&#039;m sure you hear this all the time but your book truly touched my heart\u2014it felt like it was written specifically with me in mind. The story of your proud tomboy protagonist had an especially profound effect on me because she reminded me of myself at that age: struggling to find her place in the world while being true to herself despite what everyone else thought or said about her gender identity.
