Your apology is accepted, its a good trait to be able to apologise when its right.<br>Point 2. Because of what i remember about You and Your dating i think it might be your intimacy craving that gets in the way, at least in regards to this part :<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no matter how many things i do for others i just end up getting forgotten about or walked all over and i cant even say anything about it without embarrassing myself or being the bad guy</span><br>Afaik if guys see you as too easy they will decide you are low value and thus not worth caring about<br>I think the point is that You should set up standards for yourself so that you seem more valuable/hard to get. And i mean it both with sexual intimacy as well as emotional engagement.<br>As for trans part yeah no no idea how to help with it myself ;-;", "time": 1671698804, "resto": 28855680, "trip": "!GNrGHxOKPI"}, {"no": 28856933, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)05:03:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28855680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28855680</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;QOTT1: how do you celebrate christmas?</span><br>Tablegrilling with the family. 12 strong now with my 3 month old nephew.

Prog has been observed to modulate the expression and behavior of estrogen receptors. If I&#039;m remembering correctly, in rabbit models large spikes have been shown to result in a (very) temporary downregulation of estrogen receptors on the surface of breast cells. Our reproductive systems are quite different, but this MAY be an argument in favor of cycling prog, as it also results in a burst of prolactin which makes the tissue more sensitive estrogen after prog levels dip. The best thing to do if you want to maximize breast growth, IMO, is to get all of the growth you can out of just E before staying on prog long term, as everyone&#039;s body will respond differently to it.

The natural state for any physical body is &quot;use it or lose it&quot;. Imagine you&#039;re constantly losing a small percentage of your strength every day. Normal activity, like walking down the hall and taking out the trash causes you to build a very small amount of strength. Working out does a lot more.

Just doing that little bit of housework helps to counteract this a lot. Testosterone made it so the rate that you lose strength at was low. Without male levels of T, the rate you lose strength at will be a lot higher, so you need to do more just to counteract the loss and even more to bulk.

Just for more icing on the cake, sometimes dysphoria is so painful that I can&#039;t think about or feel anything else and I&#039;m desperately considering transition, then it relents a bit to where I can tolerate being a man even though I still want to be a woman and it makes me question my sanity from earlier when I was wanting to transition so badly and question if it&#039;s even worth going through transition.

So when someone sees it as a good thing I like it. And I have always been attracted to guys that\u2019s not a meta attraction although that\u2019s probably part of it. I actually feel safer being feminine with girls than with guys because I use my masculine side to protect my feminine side and with guys I\u2019m more vulnerable + rampant homophobia makes me act more masculine and guarded around guys. So for me meta attraction is more that I feel safer being feminine with guys if there\u2019s a girl to assure me it\u2019s safe. And I like being feminine with girls because it shows me that she truly likes me and there\u2019s more trust and less expectation to be a man that stresses me out.", "time": 1671776341, "resto":
