This is done for the comfort of FTM readers who prefer a mix of vague and masculine descriptors when trans men are written in erotica. I ask for any comments to not contain transphobic slurs (c**tboy, tr***y, etc.) or any language that treats trans people as a fetish. Any found doing so will be deleted.

There are different types of ugls (underground labs) and different ways they sell. Some are larger operations and some are smaller. Labs generally get the powder from a third party (also illegal) and then make the vials themselves by measuring out the powder, oil, and preservative and sterilizing it (or claiming to sterilize it). A lot of different groups who do this and sell it. Some places claim to have facilities but again, very few actually back up their claims. Best you can do is check if they have 3rd party testing.<br>Reviews from users are unreliable and hit and miss because they can&#039;t actually test the perfect amount themselves and they&#039;ll be taking a dozen substances at once lol.

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti\u2010Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced.

Imho it&#039;s hard to sustain coherently. If Orthodox and Catholic are right and church tradition is important, then their tradition states that homosexual acts are wrong. On the other hand if they are wrong and protestants are right and the Bible is what matters, the Bible still says homosexual acts are wrong. I&#039;ve looked into some of the counter-arguments and they mostly don&#039;t make sense to me. Like a common one is that the Bible was only referring to sex acts associated with paganism.

Most of the anti-gay stuff in the NT is from Paul. The problem with that is Paul laid out most of Christian theology and if you go back to just what Jesus said.. most of the stuff about the Mosaic law no longer applying comes from Paul and Jesus mostly just talked to Jews.
