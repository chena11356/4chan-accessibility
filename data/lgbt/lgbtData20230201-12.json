So I passed on a test to join a programming school who has kinda of a partnership with other companies. Basically you join and you only start paying after you get a job (if the job is from the programming area. and if the salary is greater than 3k), ex students from there say getting a job studying there is not hard since they have partnership with other companies and the jobs pay well. And if you don&#039;t find a job in 5 years, you don&#039;t have to pay it. BUT THE DOWNSIDES ARE: the classes schedule: 2pm to 8pm. Yeah, and you can&#039;t skip it. and if you don&#039;t pass the exams you can be expelled(same thing will happen if you skip classes) and you will have to pay all the classes you did before you got expelled even if you dont have a job. So will it be possible to work even if I have to study from 2pm to 8pm if I find a job? Will I be able to get a gf if I get this busy? Do I join?

Many media reports contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. Reports described how Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except where it had been partially cleansed by his tears.[10][14][15]<br><br>The assailants&#039; girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at the time of the attack.[16][17] McKinney and Henderson testified that they learned of Shepard&#039;s address and intended to steal from his home as well. After attacking Shepard and leaving him tied to the fence in near-freezing temperatures, McKinney and Henderson returned to town. McKinney proceeded to pick a fight with two men, 19-year-old Emiliano Morales and 18-year-old Jeremy Herrara. The fight resulted in head wounds for both Morales and McKinney.[18] Police officer Flint Waters arrived at the scene of the fight. He arrested Henderson, searched McKinney&#039;s truck, and found a blood-smeared gun along with Shepard&#039;s shoes and credit card.[9] Henderson and McKinney later tried to persuade their girlfriends to provide alibis for them and help them dispose of evidence.[19]", "filename": "8926878606056", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1712, "h": 1170, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1675248283123718, "time": 1675248283, "md5": "XvIMWGJ5U7LhkUQ/hddocA==", "fsize": 1041129, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "now-that-the-dust-has-settled", "replies": 12, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 29420895, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)05:45:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Still tied to the fence, Shepard was in a coma eighteen hours after the attack when he was discovered by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow.[20] Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. Shepard was transported first to Ivinson Memorial Hospital in Laramie before being moved to the more advanced trauma ward at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado.[21] He had suffered fractures to the back of his head and in front of his right ear. He experienced severe brainstem damage, which affected his body&#039;s ability to regulate his heart rate, body temperature, and other vital functions. There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face, and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support.

However, after Shepard was admitted into the hospital following his attack by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, doctors diagnosed him as HIV-positive. Additionally, Shepard&#039;s attackers had used the bloodied gun they beat Shepard with on two other victims, Emiliano Morales and Jeremy Herrara. They had to undergo treatment in case they were infected with Shepard&#039;s blood. His attackers were also considered at risk of infection. A Laramie journalist covering Shepherd&#039;s death told Vanity Fair that this would&#039;ve been cosmic justice.<br><br>Shepard&#039;s friends were afraid that news of his HIV status would make strangers feel less outraged about his murder since HIV was deadly, anyway. Indeed, news of Shepard&#039;s HIV infection was used against him. Those sympathetic to his attackers painted a picture of a seductive Shepard who deliberately tried to infect McKinney and Henderson, but people close to Shepard believed he was unaware of his infection, especially since he hadn&#039;t told anyone of it. His mother knew that Shepard had routinely gotten tested after he was sexually assaulted in Morocco, and these tests always came back negative. His friends and family didn&#039;t believe he would&#039;ve kept such information secret because of his open manner. They also believe that Shepard wouldn&#039;t have wanted to contribute to the stigma surrounding HIV by keeping it secret, according toVanity Fair.", "time": 1675248439, "resto": 29420893}, {"no":

It&#039;s a bit different for everyone. Some know from the very beginning and insist they&#039;re the opposite sex as soon as they can speak, others repress it completely and don&#039;t even realize that they&#039;re dysphoric or can&#039;t quite but their finger on how they feel until they&#039;re older. I was somewhere inbetween where I knew I wanted to be a girl since I was a kid but was taught that wasn&#039;t ok so I kept quiet bc I wanted to be a good kid. Once puberty hit the dysphoria did too and I found myself praying to god every night to turn me into a girl. Like a kid dreaming about getting a bunch of crazy stuff for xmas and asking santa for all of it and then being so disappointed when you don&#039;t get it. But while with santa you learn to cope and move on, dysphoria just gets worse. I would dissociate and put on a mask to get through the day but when I was alone with my thoughts it felt like being awake in a nightmare with a body that I didn&#039;t recognize. I was convinced I was in a coma or something, passed out somewhere in my normal female body, hallucinating my entire male existence. And a whole bunch of depression to top it all off. Thought a lot about kms to escape the nightmare and maybe wake up in my normal body.<br>Honestly as cliche as it is, at the end of the day &quot;feeling like you&#039;re in the wrong body&quot; is fairly accurate. And it&#039;s insanely distressing. Again think about when you&#039;re sick, your body just doesn&#039;t feel right, right? Cause it&#039;s not running the way you know it&#039;s supposed to. And sometimes when you&#039;re really fucking sick you look in the mirror and see your sick ass self and you don&#039;t even recognize the person looking back cause it&#039;s so different than what you know you normally look like.

The problem is that most people cannot consciously control the muscles that do this, nor can they consciously learn to do it by rote. Instead, the most effective approach is to create exercises that the conscious brain can focus on that basically trick your body into learning how to unconsciously control the right muscles and give you the muscle memory to be able to consistently do it on command. Because of how this works, you&#039;re better off trying different exercises and practising them all until you find the one(s) that work for you rather than spending your time intellectualizing them. <br><br>Big dog little dog, whisper siren, sliding from oooooo to eeeeeeee, and cat hissing are all just different tricks to try and teach your body to unconsciously do the same thing. Try them all, rotate between them, eventually your body should learn what it needs to.
