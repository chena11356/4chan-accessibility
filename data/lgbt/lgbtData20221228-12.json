I just want you guys to be prettier longer. I was with a twink dude during high school (ldr) who was short, had a neotenous face, had female fat proportions, and a really large ass. He was so hot. If he used makeup I&#039;m 99% sure he could&#039;ve mogged Finn to the ground.<br><br>5 years later he has facial hair (and he always has a shadow), a masc face, and male proportions. He still has a decent ass but that&#039;s about it. I wish I knew about HRT so I could&#039;ve saved him. He said he takes care of himself and that I shouldn&#039;t worry about aging. He runs daily, does skin care, and even has a good diet but that couldn&#039;t do much for masculinization.<br><br>I still have his old pics (yes, it&#039;s technically CP but I don&#039;t really care since its hot). I don&#039;t really talk to him too much anymore. I hate that I&#039;ve resorted to basically being Leonardo Dicaprio and ditching bttms the moment they turn 25. Just take hrt and stay pretty, God damn. It&#039;s not a big deal. I don&#039;t even like that dress up shit most femboys do.

What you mentioned is as far as I know the more common response from those socialized as boys/men because the expectation from them is that they exhibit very little emotion in response to their trauma, and that if they do it must be anger. So much of traditional masculinity revolves around who is the more dominant figure, and who is where on the proverbial totem pole. Because vulnerability is seen as emasculating, rape and assault of men is thereby one of the most emasculating things in the eyes of traditional masculinity.

Here are a few steps you can follow to voice train:<br><br>Warm up your voice: Before you start any vocal exercises, it&#039;s important to warm up your voice. This helps to loosen up your vocal cords and get your muscles ready for singing or speaking. You can do some simple vocal warm-ups, such as humming, lip trills, or sirens.<br><br>Practice proper breathing: Good breath control is essential for strong and effective vocalization. Practice taking deep breaths from your diaphragm and exhaling slowly to develop your breath control.<br><br>Work on pitch and tone: To improve your pitch and tone, try singing or speaking scales or arpeggios. You can also try singing or speaking in different registers, such as your head voice or chest voice, to develop your range.<br><br>Focus on diction: Pay attention to your diction and enunciation when speaking or singing. This will help you to be understood more clearly and to project your voice effectively.<br><br>Find a vocal coach or mentor: Working with a vocal coach or mentor can be very helpful in learning how to voice train. They can provide guidance and feedback on your progress, as well as help you to develop a personalized training plan.<br><br>Remember to be patient and consistent with your voice training.

Have you ever heard of cognitive dissonance? For me it was like a defense mechanism like my earliest memory of cross dressing was getting caught at 5 and being so embarrassed. I don&#039;t even have a memory before then of learning it wasn&#039;t ok but I def knew from a very young age so my brain like went into survival mode and convinced itself I was a normal boy and me being trans was never even a possibility. Every time I saw something that challenged that like seeing a successful tranner in media or a moment of clarity when I was dressed up I would immediately get really anxious and uncomfortable and my brain would dissociate until it went back to normal and I forgot the feeling. I grew up mormon and that sort of thing is really common with their religion too, when confronted with information that contradicts their views they go into cognitive dissonance shut down mode.

I hope you understand the consequences of this. You can&#039;t be sexual 24/7. You can&#039;t count on being with him forever. Even if you&#039;re long term, he may die before you and what then? You&#039;ll still have gender dysphoria.<br>You need to be able to function in normal society and everything outside of a kink context. How are you doing that/planning on doing that?<br>How much of this did you negotiate and discuss in advance? If you didn&#039;t give him explicit permission to throw away your binders and hold them as ransom for permission to cum then that&#039;s undeniably abusive and you need to leave asap. Otherwise, it&#039;s annoying that you just threw them out instead of donating and I really really hope you thought about the potential long term consequences of this.<br>You can do all this in an exolocitly role play setting without affecting your real life. The idea of you being trans but actually detransitioning to fulfill a kink is disturbing for reasons I listed above (still needing to function outside of sex and outside of a relationship).<br>Right before covid I conditioned a fwb to only orgasm if I clapped. Unfortunately, I was the only guy she was sleeping with at that point so she didn&#039;t have an opportunity to train that with other guys (or on her own), and she was unable to orgasm for multiple months because of that until I was able to see her and retrain her. If you and your boyfriend break up, then how you going to handle the adjustment back? Anything that plays with you psychologically like that is firmly in the RACK classification and NOT SSC.
