Do not just go back and forth and let them lead the conversation. There are wayyyyy more guys on dating apps than women and if you&#039;re not forward then another guy will be. Women also tend to be really flakey on dating apps. Explicitly try to get a date as soon as possible. After initial introductions, say something like &quot;I&#039;m going to blah blah blah on Saturday, do you want to join me?&quot; and see if they agree. If not, then ask them what their schedule is like and try again with something else. If you try a few times and they don&#039;t seem to be interested in meeting irl, then give up and move on. People online will not feel bad about ghosting you because they don&#039;t have a human connection, so you need to convert it to an irl connection asap. Once you have a date set up and their phone number, THEN talk more casually and show your personality and everything, but make sure that in order to experience you fully they have to meet you in person. Of course there&#039;s a limit to this, do all this in an actual conversation and don&#039;t sound like a receptionist or robot, but do try to focus on getting an actual date.<br>Irl it&#039;s much easier, make them feel good and talk to them and have them build an emotional connection and get their number and set up a date over text. They&#039;re less likely to be talking to a dozen other guys in that scenario but do make sure that the relationship feels real to them.<br>WHERE you go depends on what you&#039;re looking for. Clubs I wouldn&#039;t recommend unless you&#039;re just looking for a hookup. Where do you go out to have fun and frequent? Etc.

Some people will end up looking away and being uncomfortable around them, which makes me feel bad about it. If I&#039;m around someone, they need to be comfortable with all of me, including the needle use. Not an issue for most people but still happens sometimes so may as well bring it up<br>Organ/blood donation thing is just something morally that I feel extremely strongly about. Plenty of people die every day due to not having an organ transplant. It&#039;s not doing anything being buried/cremated, but you could literally save someone&#039;s life instead. To me, someone who doesn&#039;t do that and willingly is more okay and comfortable with someone dying over donating their organs is not someone I can see myself with. Donating blood is also easy and necessary for people to survive and I don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t put up with a minor inconvenience to save people&#039;s lives. If you&#039;re not the type of person willing to do that, then you&#039;re not the type of person I wanna date.

Death soon following.<br><br>Although, this practice was seeming hopeful in creating this perfect being, it was usually agonizing for the boymoders, as the moment the seed was put inside, they would shed their skin, becoming a new, real woman.

It was seeming like all hopes were lost... <br><br>Until rumors of a certain suit that you could put on this boymoder started spreading around, If you put this suit on a boymoder, the man can still retain his heterosexuality, while creating the perfect being. Could this also prevent the boymoder from dying? We must find out, this could be a huge breakthrough in Boyscience.<br><br>Getting this suit wouldn&#039;t be easy though, if the rumors are true it means that its being heavily guarded by the Empire of KEA, Some of the most fearsome stuffed shark warriors, known for their brutality, it seemed like the man was going to need a army....<br><br>2BC......", "filename": "1673225150623981", "ext": ".png", "w": 760, "h": 472, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 155, "tim": 1673352898425484, "time": 1673352898, "md5": "Dv234PxV8ngiacfy+vK36A==", "fsize": 15763, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "set-in-19th-century-england-a-true-and-real-story", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 29123391, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:18:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29123362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29123362</a><br>am interested, might make you compete with gpt", "time": 1673353103, "resto": 29123362}, {"no": 29123428, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)07:24:12", "name": "Usada Pekora", "com": "What is this &quot;suit&quot; you speak of?", "time": 1673353452, "resto": 29123362}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29115062, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)16:43:39", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/clg/ Cis lesbian general - Lesbian bird edition", "com": "Inspired by power couple Electra and Viola, we stan<br>https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc<wbr>-out/lesbian-penguin-super-moms-wel<wbr>come-chick-spanish-aquarium-n123807<wbr>2<br><br>Thread questions:<br>1.

thread <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28839800</span> hitting bump limit after two days. the only difference is explicitly referencing transgirls, instead of implicitly from being posted on /tttt/. what about all the implicitly /tttt/ threads just talking about receiving dick, without professing /tttt/ identity (the mod had no answer). diaper threads <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28308707</span> (6d, 315 posts), <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28403628</span> (2d, 286 posts, deleted??), <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28535894</span> (2d, 135 posts), <a href=\"/lgbt/thread/29008930#p29008930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29008930</a> (2d, 193 posts). frengen deleted after 8d, 174 posts <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;28529068</span><br><br>how do i conform", "filename": "popopoka_-1422904844826861568-20210804_085845-img3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3835, "h": 3624, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1673026312561740, "time": 1673026312, "md5": "mpzzDNVpPeMTOwYSvwt+tg==", "fsize": 1999403, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070542, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)12:43:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070431</a><br>please go outside anon<br><br>find a club and join it, like running or smash tournaments, a cooking class even. it just has to be outside.", "time": 1673026980, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070770, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:06:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070431</a><br>what?", "filename": "FWnFKNkXwAE93nR", "ext": ".png", "w": 660, "h": 809, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673028364482006, "time": 1673028364, "md5": "oN9KeaMo3KjtjDvXOH7qqQ==", "fsize": 550248, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070802, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:08:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070431</a><br>Now this is the kind of schizoposting I come to 4chan for.", "time": 1673028529, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070806, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070431</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s just hopeless. there is no consistency</span><br>your first professional job will drive you absolutely insane but after a few months you\u2019ll be numb to this feeling", "time": 1673028538, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070838, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070806</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the human on the other side of that post will ever be emotionally stable enough to hold a professional job</span><br>nigga what", "filename": "1602706781880", "ext": ".png", "w": 705, "h": 514, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1673028689042319, "time": 1673028689, "md5": "M00/C8fmGvhf9Uer5trpnw==", "fsize": 648119, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29070861, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:13:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29070431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29070431</a><br>1) I&#039;m sure you knew not to reply to off topic threads<br>2) in confused on why the thread wasn&#039;t deleted and is archived instead.", "time": 1673028782, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29071000, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29066211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29066211</a><br>small relatively new discord server with yandere aesthetic looking for new members. hang out and vc if you want to with people and play games, make friends.", "filename": "1664813159427190", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 600, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673029363858900, "time": 1673029363, "md5": "cr5d3OvsUAJQGJGKkgO71A==", "fsize": 82743, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29071025, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:24:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29071000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29071000</a><br>forgot the link<br>https://discord.gg/MkFkPJGV", "time": 1673029488, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29071139, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:33:56", "name": "luzer", "com": "<a href=\"#p29067814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29067814</a><br>Favorite to laugh at maybe", "time": 1673030036, "resto": 29066211, "trip": "!!cFfUMiVYF8k"}, {"no": 29071238, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)13:39:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29066211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29066211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A/S/L</span><br>25/mtf/UK<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sexuality</span><br>Bi<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;About me</span><br>Friendly and open to talk about a lot of things.

we&#039;d likely be able to get along! i&#039;m also just a huge fan of music in general! some of my favorite artists right now are asian glow, king krule, viper the rapper, ichiko aoba, mount eerie, grouper, iglooghost, earl sweatshirt, etc etc etc. i love shoegaze and hip-hop and atmospheric stuff. i also love playing games (mostly just FFXIV, but also JRPGs and horror games! i love indie games of all kinds as well) and reading manga (reading chainsaw man pt. 2!!!!) and watching anime (currently bocchi-maxxing). i uhhhh i think there&#039;s more i could say but i&#039;m too shy and writing

of sins (legal) that i wish to complete in order because i find that fascinating and after that id like to complete a bucket list of anti sins like philanthropy etc, studying people, how they think because every behavior no matter how minor is interesting and i like analyzing people by looking at them or hearing their voice, <br>about me:<br>On the surface i seem sociopathic and cold and some would say evil, but underneath im really just a good person, an empath with a warm heart protected by many walls of thick ice. Im a bit flirty and bantery but not in a serious way, just a memey online way, im already dating someone and have no interest in cheating. when I was 20-22 i had an awful phase where i wanted to dominate everyone and was very manipulative and just generally a creepy fake conniving person, just in general i was a control freak. But iv grown from that and now know wanting to control others is because you lack control of yourself. Now im like the opposite, I want people to be as free as possible without any of my influences on them, i love free will and I love humanity as a fellow human lets just enjoy being free and dance and eat and sing into the never ending night. The only thing that remains is that i still have an awful relationship with my mom, but on the surface im kind to her without letting her know i hate her. you probably think im cringe by now and you&#039;re right, i like to think of myself as a cringe expert.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking for</span><br>Im not too sure, i uhh, lets just talk sometimes i reply within hours to to days. but i never ghost.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not looking for</span><br>dunno<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Contact</span><br>Adrastia#8101", "filename": "tumblr_p0i424BR1S1vtxltoo1_1280", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 816, "h": 1159, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673325853304544, "time": 1673325853, "md5": "sG99nXvmloAtkW9fqyyyng==", "fsize": 173839, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29120277, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)23:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29119199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29119199</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ultimately an internet bf/gf that will be obsessed with me and message me every day</span><br>if it really is after you show someone a picture of yourself then it must be because they don&#039;t see you as very attractive. maybe anglemaxx harder so when they inevitably find out you&#039;re not that great looking they&#039;re already committed and will learn to cope with the fact that they&#039;re dating a hon. that, or you look fine and just got unlucko. no offense btw..", "filename": "youmureclining", "ext": ".png", "w": 650, "h": 650, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673326019760902, "time": 1673326019, "md5": "jdqaChUuX9rlVb13hAvQOg==", "fsize": 366785, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29120599, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:23:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29120277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29120277</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cope with the fact that they&#039;re dating a hon</span><br>motherfucker I am a MAN not a tranny", "time": 1673328211, "resto": 29066211}, {"no": 29120743, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ASL</span><br>31/MtF/SoCal<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;About You/Interests</span><br>Going back to school right now to finish degrees.

Across the aisle from me sitting all by himself was an older business man silver fox type of guy...to which I am attracted. Traveling always makes me hormy so I am fantasizing about this guy across the aisle- letting myself get rock hard in in my jeans sorta hoping he would notice and take a shine to me. What I didnt notice was that some other guy got up to go the bathroom and when he came out he just stood in the back. After while I notice him back there and realize he is checking me and my rock hard penis out. I start freaking out a little...but he sits down in the last row (behind the silver fox) and kinda makes eyes at me. Then he gets up goes back the bathroom and motions me to follow. I sit there for a moment freaking out then decide to follow. I go in, he immediately takes off my shirt, pushes me down on the toilet, pulls out his cock and pulls my head close. I suck him off for maybe a minute or 2 before he tells me he is cumming and grabs the back of my head. I dutifully swallow most of it and he zips up and immediately leaves. I sit there for several moments wondering wtf just happened then go back to my seat. never saw the guy again even after getting off the plane.

The same goes for men who do TRT when they see an age-related decline in testosterone production: exogenous testosterone use increases the risk of prostate cancer as high T (and DHT) levels are a risk factor for prostate cancer.

You don&#039;t just &quot;bounce back in a few weeks&quot; after taking estrogen for 6+months and having T levels 1/10th of a healthy male, if that.

In contrast the girls of Groups B and C, all of whom were deficient in gonadotrophins, showed only the development of breast buds (Pz) after 6 months of treatment and in none did breast development exceed stage P3 after 3 years of oestrogen substitution therapy. Similar results were noted by Burns et al. (1981) in girls with hypopituitarism due to craniopharyngioma.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These findings indicate that gonadotrophins are indispensable for the effectiveaction of oestrogen on breast development. It is of interest that a number ofcomprehensive reviews on the influence of hormones on the mammary gland fail to mention the possible effectsof gonadotrophins (Bassler, 1970; Porter, 1974; Ceriani, 1974; Topper &amp; Freeman, 1980). Paulsen (1975)observed breast development in men with isolated LH deficiency(fertile eunuchs) but not in men with deficiencyof both LH and FSH. Thus it may be postulated that of the gonadotrophins FSH is the more important, apparently functioning as a permissive or priming factor for the action of oestrogen on the breast tissue, It would be of interest to test the cells of the mammary gland for the presence of receptors to gonadotrophins or FSH.&quot;</span>", "time": 1673351436, "resto": 29098228}, {"no": 29123170, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29123156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29123156</a><br>So I need high LH and FSH to get big boobs?<br>Just tell me what pills I need to shove up my butt, I&#039;ll do it.", "time": 1673351564, "resto": 29098228}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29123146, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:49:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If I peeled off all my skin then made clothes out of it then wore the clothes would that count as me being naked or not?", "filename": "Screenshot_20230109-115505_YouTube", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1876, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 143, "tim": 1673351382923036, "time": 1673351382, "md5": "wHE0k09Ln4P7d4H+ppmK2w==", "fsize": 425403, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "if-i-peeled-off-all-my-skin-then-made-clothes-out", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29123079, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:43:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I love trans women so much that I\u2019m disappointed when I find out a woman I find attractive is cis", "filename": "1673350210151774", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673350984419543, "time": 1673350984, "md5": "yIXJzCNJQ3aR36p0BkxsXA==", "fsize": 733693, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-love-trans-women-so-much-that-im-disappointed", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 29123105, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:45:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29123079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29123079</a><br>fetish", "time": 1673351138, "resto": 29123079}, {"no": 29123141, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "me in the back", "time": 1673351347, "resto": 29123079}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 29122566, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:49:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s she smirking at?", "filename": "url(27)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1320, "h": 880, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1673347770354529, "time": 1673347770, "md5": "J9pbsmP3JkUakSuzuupgAQ==", "fsize": 116720, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-she-smirking-at", "replies": 14, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 29122596, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:52:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122566</a><br>Autogynesmile", "time": 1673347963, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122635, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:56:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122566</a><br>a little known fact is that not only do the british have lopside faces, but also lopsided brains, lungs, and kidneys.", "time": 1673348162, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122645, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)05:56:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122635</a><br>it&#039;s from all that inbreeding innit", "time": 1673348203, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122808, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:13:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122596</a><br>This, most female terfs are cissexual autogynephiles, they obsess over female bodily functions because it satisfies their sick perversion", "time": 1673349225, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122815, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:14:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122566</a><br>When they give you that TDS stare", "filename": "linny ham2", "ext": ".png", "w": 579, "h": 322, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1673349276481557, "time": 1673349276, "md5": "9Pr+AfOUnI0MbpWSPNoJ/w==", "fsize": 9332, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122838, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:16:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29122566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29122566</a><br>The sells for Hogwarts Lagacy", "time": 1673349415, "resto": 29122566}, {"no": 29122853, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:18:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "She&#039;s got plenty to smile about.

It is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of the blessing I&#039;ve been granted to come to exist on this planet at precisely the right moment to be alive at the same time as Hunter Schafer and to experience her kino coming to fruition as a tangible, living process, flesh and spirit, now. I hope I&#039;m lucky enough to catch even so much as a glimpse of her IRL one day, not to meet her or be a creep or anything, just to be able to know that I experienced that beauty, that realness, as visceral, tangible truth in the short time I was on this earth.", "filename": "20220824_235630", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 795, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673330354541681, "time":

What does that mean? Most of us if not all know the face in our mirrors but not the person in the photographs; the vexing glance at the face that is a psychologically shattering juxtaposition, brutally unwinding the warm tape our ego commands in our heads: the face that is in front of our desperate wish to at least be attractive in our stumbling failing lives is actually shown in our true face, our ugly attempts at smiling, as if to show to the world the lighting of our last match in our own pelagic darkness that we wish to hide so badly. The face in the well-lit photograph is luridly asymmetric; discolored, jaundiced around the mouth; the eyes are like that of an old, weathered stuffed animal that is still attempting to look happy in its decrepit state, staring to the pastel sky from the hole of a trash can; the youth of our cheeks is receding like the tide of a sunny day we missed in debilitating misery and remember through our dirty, dusty windows; the mouth is small and distorted in its attempt at a vaguely sympathetic, artificial pleasantry; the frosting of it all is the grease and the sweat; we become the sad monster that we saw swimming through our alcoholic father&#039;s bottles. In our wish of sublimity and grace we become inseparable from the very thing we are running from. How do you know what you really look like?

But the lack of monogamy is the biggest issue: it decreases overall genetic diversity in populations, it makes childrearing much much worse (single mother parenting leads to a myriad of mental issues), it doesn&#039;t actually make birth rates higher (because the number of children each woman bears doesn&#039;t increase) etc.<br>Finally excessive testosterone causes lower intelligence and higher rate of incarceration in men. <br>So basically, while these traits are good for survival in a pre-societal environment, any post-social contract society doesn&#039;t benefit from them, and their exclusivity in the human race (which is what would result from systematic inceldom or trannyism of non-chad males) would drive it backward to the extreme.", "time": 1673291233, "resto": 29101684}, {"no": 29113202, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:09:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29111216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29111216</a><br>you WILL take that Big Chaser Cock, and you will like it<br><br>now shut up and take your pills, Alice", "time": 1673291347, "resto": 29101684}, {"no": 29113319, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:19:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29113177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29113177</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh society</span><br>But what if society is bad to begin with?
