John gave me only his first name and informed me that I was the first to be told what he was about to tell me.

Other than intrusive and repeated fantasies of being female, he had refused to allow himself any overt form of female gender expression. He reported feeling that if he was to cross-dress and be caught, he would dishonor his wife and family. Having attained international recognition for his work, he was also concerned about his professional reputation. The only other form of temporary relief came through masturbating, often up to five times a day.<br><br>Some gender dysphoric individuals proceed into their senior years with their needs and desires to be female still unresolved.

It\u2019s thrilling for a few reasons. <br><br>First is the excitement of a new toy. Yes, you can buy a big rubber dick on Amazon, but you really don\u2019t know how big it is or if it\u2019s really appealing until you see it in person. Picking one out that you can see is obviously better.<br><br>Beyond that, there\u2019s the naughtiness. You know you shouldn\u2019t be in there. Only perverts go in there. But there you are, pulling into the parking lot.<br><br>There\u2019s also an exciting type of embarrassment, a sort of public shaming that\u2019s actually a turn on. I\u2019m not into that normally, but I rationalize going inside as it being semi-private and non-judgmental, all the while knowing deep down that yes, I\u2019m being judged (and it makes me horny).<br><br>The feeling of going to a sex shop is exactly the same feeling you get going to a guys house for sex. It\u2019s super exciting, and a giant turn on. You\u2019ll probably speed home to punish yourself with your new toy.

See someone who looks like a woman, call her a woman. See someone who looks like a man, call him a man. Sometimes you get it wrong, like with pcos butches, but since pronouns are words connected to indicators of ostensible sex, that error rate is just how it is. Putting pronouns aside, a &quot;woman&quot; is simply someone who either has a biofemale physical body it or is transitioning to approximate one. But unpassing trans women understandably still get he/him&#039;d. A &quot;man&quot; is simply someone who either has a biomale physical body it or is transitioning to approximate one. Intersex edge cases are technically nonbinary to be honest.<br><br>But the conversation about pronouns fucking confuses me. There are unpassing MtFs who say everyone should she/her them, even though pronouns in daily life with strangers is obviously based on your ostensible gendered appearance. Even more confusing are people who say pronouns are not connected to gender (then wtf are pronouns and what are they for).<br><br>Underlying all this tends to be an argument about &quot;internal gender identity&quot; but personally I never felt any internal gender identity. I never felt like a woman. I just knew I wanted a biofemale physical body and not having one gave me distress.
