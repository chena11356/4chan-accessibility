Other favorite snacks include a handful of nuts (peanuts, almonds, cashews, etc) or fruits (especially apples and bananas).

Do you know of any mysteries?</span><br>Yes. One &quot;mystery&quot; that I&#039;m very interested in is the Finders cult.<br>A mysterious child trafficking new age cult that was found transporting children across the US-Mexico border. It had ties to a Satanic panic case that the FBI had found actual evidence of being real, including secret tunnels with pentagram iconography.<br>The FBI continued investigating and searching Finders cult related properties. They had found cages on a farmhouse that seemed to have been used to keep children locked away.<br>The FBI continued working with border patrol and local police agencies and felt as though they were close to finding out the truth. They had flight logs, purchasing history, etc. and it all seemed to be pointing to an international child trafficking ring that involved incredibly rich individuals who had properties in a number of countries including all the way out in China.<br>All of a sudden the CIA came into the case, declared it an internal matter while sucking up all of the evidence.<br>Shortly thereafter the case was declared &quot;closed&quot; and the CIA never continued looking into the Finders cult.<br>No one knows why they did what they did, where the evidence went ,etc.<br>All we have are semi-declassified FBI documents. They were only declassified a few years ago and prior to that you could actually find those same documents floating around online.<br>Of course, back then everyone thought they had to be fake. Because I mean, the FBI investigating a new-age satanic child trafficking cult and the CIA stepping in sounds insane, right?<br>Well, one day they declassify the matter and it turns out those images were real leaked images of these same documents.<br>And no one, absolutely no one, knows what happened to the Finders cult.<br>There were never any charges in spite of the evidence, no one knows what happened to the driver that had kids in the truck, etc.", "time": 1675280032, "resto": 29425242}, {"no": 29425723, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)15:08:40", "name": "vuuv", "com": "<a href=\"#p29425328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29425328</a><br>oooo cults poggies", "time": 1675282120, "resto": 29425242, "trip": "!!MTJH4H808bF"}, {"no": 29427036, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:48:20", "name": "vuuv", "com": "(^\u4eba^)", "time": 1675288100, "resto": 29425242, "trip": "!!MTJH4H808bF"}, {"no": 29427125, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29425242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29425242</a><br>yo trans people, i&#039;m a cross boarder from /m/ and i&#039;ve been reading up on the latest controversy over harry potter and the fairy dust of fulchester or whatever this game is called, what with jk rowling being a Blairite Idiot Trans Cyberbulling Hatemongerer (BITCH) and all. <br><br>Are any of you fans of Harry Potter?

The resulting gender dysphoria (GD), is frequently treated with cross-sex hormones. However, very little is known about how this treatment affects the brain of individuals with GD, nor do we know the neurobiology of GD. We recently suggested that disconnection of fronto-parietal networks involved in own-body self-referential processing could be a plausible mechanism, and that the anatomical correlate could be a thickening of the mesial prefrontal and precuneus cortex, which is unrelated to sex. Here, we investigate how cross-sex hormone treatment affects cerebral tissue in persons with GD, and how potential changes are related to self-body perception.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;significant Cth decreases were observed in the mesial prefrontal and parietal cortices, in both TrM and TrW (vs. controls) \u2013 regions showing greater pre-treatment Cth than in controls. The own body \u2013 self congruence ratings increased with treatment, and correlated with a left parietal cortical thinning. These data confirm our hypothesis that GD may be associated with specific anatomical features in own-body/self-processing circuits that reverse to the pattern of cisgender controls after cross-sex hormone treatment.</span>", "time": 1675302332, "resto": 29429237}, {"no": 29430135, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:05:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29429919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29429919</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...reverse to the pattern of cisgender controls after cross-sex hormone treatment.</span><br>But isn&#039;t this just saying that cross-sex hormones are making the brain change into the opposite gender?

So you may say &quot;But they were likely on pain meds&quot; but then isn&#039;t the stim user also on pain meds for the mind?<br>That&#039;s my perspective on it anyway, you can draw the line at physical and psychological addictions, but they&#039;re both addictions. Plenty of people were physically addicted to things and then died due to their sheer resolve to never touch it again, even though logically they could have tapered off.<br><a href=\"#p29430607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29430607</a><br>Yeah it could have just been the regional producer being a shitty chemist.

The problem is that most people cannot consciously control the muscles that do this, nor can they consciously learn to do it by rote. Instead, the most effective approach is to create exercises that the conscious brain can focus on that basically trick your body into learning how to unconsciously control the right muscles and give you the muscle memory to be able to consistently do it on command.

Basically, the goal is to shrink the space in your throat and your mouth (in the right way where it doesn&#039;t cause strain) so that your voice has a much smaller space to resonate in, which causes it to sound &#039;smaller&#039;. Making your voice sound smaller is the #1 most important goal of voice training, and it means you have to learn to raise the larynx in your throat, and to shape your mouth and tongue in such a way as to make the space inside your mouth smaller and so that it amplifies upper mid-range frequencies but dampens low range and super high frequencies.<br><br>The hard part is that most people cannot consciously identify and control the right muscles so you can&#039;t learn to do this by being told which muscles to use and learn it by rote practice. Instead, exercises try to teach you indirectly by giving you something to mentally focus on and mimic that can help you learn to unconsciously control the right muscles.<br><br>This is what all the popular exercises like big dog little dog, whisper siren, hissing cat, oooo to eeeee slides, and so on are trying to do. But since they&#039;re all indirect mental tricks, different ones work better for different people, and you should try a bunch to see which works best for you.<br><br>Once you have those two aspects of voice training down, then you can work on speaking a bit softer and on raising pitch, if necessary (but not too much!).", "time": 1675298818, "resto": 29413467}, {"no": 29429540, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29427446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29427446</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;focus on is shaping your mouth cavity to shrink the space and emphasize upper mid range frequencies</span><br><a href=\"#p29429061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29429061</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shrinking and shaping the space in your mouth can make a HUGE difference to your sound</span><br>It does nothing even when I try because I have a very croaky voice naturally and even at a high pitch and a shrunken mouth my voice sounds wrong.

So I passed on a test to join a programming school who has kinda of a partnership with other companies. Basically you join and you only start paying after you get a job (if the job is from the programming area. and if the salary is greater than 3k), ex students from there say getting a job studying there is not hard since they have partnership with other companies and the jobs pay well. And if you don&#039;t find a job in 5 years, you don&#039;t have to pay it. BUT THE DOWNSIDES ARE: the classes schedule: 2pm to 8pm. Yeah, and you can&#039;t skip it. and if you don&#039;t pass the exams you can be expelled(same thing will happen if you skip classes) and you will have to pay all the classes you did before you got expelled even if you dont have a job. So will it be possible to work even if I have to study from 2pm to 8pm if I find a job? Will I be able to get a gf if I get this busy? Do I join?

This suggests that perhaps tops and true vers are biologically closer to bisexuals and/or str8 men than to gay bottoms. It might also explain the top-shortage, perhaps being a bottom is genetically more likely than being a str8 man who is willing to fuck &quot;men&quot; exclusively. Maybe being a top is less biological and more influenced by post-vitro environmental factors such as social pressure. Tops staying closeted and marrying wombyn and having kids is certainly not historically unprecedented <br><br>To quote every academic paper ever published, more research is needed to answer these questions.", "time": 1675301072, "resto": 29426543, "trip": "!!AcsnU0Qj7k0"}, {"no": 29429660, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:25:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29429627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29429627</a><br>kinda slaps ngl <br>https://youtu.be/XlOs0kXVJfQ", "time": 1675301110, "resto": 29426543}, {"no": 29429669, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:25:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29429612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29429612</a><br>That&#039;s the cheap slim Jim trash.

But this is still wrong. <br><br>Greek culture envisioned age as literally changing the gender role of a man, since after a certain age it was unseemly to still get fucked in the butt. Furthermore the word Catamite comes from Ganymede the Patron Goddess of Cismale Bottoms, and it became a slang term for gay bottom as in someone who continues to play the woman&#039;s role in sex after he&#039;s too old, and should become a man therefore bisexual top if he cares about propriety.
