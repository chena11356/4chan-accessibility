She said yes. Actually, she&#039;d been banging two different guys she worked with since June (4 months after our SEVEN year relationship ended), and started seeing this girl too who broke her heart. I couldn&#039;t believe what I was hearing. Broke down and started crying. Here I was thinking she wanted to patch things up but instead she was getting every hole filled. Felt like a total fool and idiot. Deleted her and haven&#039;t spoken to her since.

Mr. McLaughlin dragged her body to his car, placed it in the hatchback, and drove her body to the river to dispose of it.

Despite these efforts, the police found Ms. Guenther&#039;s blood in his car.

measure and wrap it nice and tight mega fucking tight around where you want your jeans to ride. this is going to be your waist measurement. some companies bullshit their measurements but nicer companies use real numbers<br>2.now you go from the middle of where you just measured and straight down on either side you measure to your gooch. once again really tight because we&#039;re looking for accuracy. these numbers are going to be your front and rear rise. this one is important because it determines how much slack is around your ass and or dicknballs<br>3.your thigh measurement, i do mine at the fattest part, just wrap my leg and then divide in half. so my 21 inch thigh would look for a pair of pants with 10-10.5 for a skin tight fight<br>4.your knee measurement, same thing. they take it generally around 14 inches or so from the crotch seam. once again, diameter of knee and half it.<br>5. the leg opening. if your jeans are non stretch, you are limited here by your foot size so measure your foot around the ball of the heel and the tendons on top so its angled the way you slide a foot though jeans. take that number and also cut it in half for this measurement. i have mens size 9 feet and can get away with a 6.75 inch opening<br>6.inseam is your gooch to where your shoes hit<br>7.outseam is the top of the waist band to where your shoes hit.<br><br>but like if youre

He leaves them after 2-3 months, maybe a few weeks if she is not forthcoming. He might date a 5 or 4 but NEVER a 3 because this would lower his value via the halo effect. He is not desperate, he has an abundance mindset. If there isn\u2019t chemistry, if there isn\u2019t love in the relationship, he can always find someone else. The psychological profile of OP is the inverse, a truvirgin/trucel. Sexually insecure, he desires someone equally if not more insecure, someone he can feel safe with, someone he feels won\u2019t cheat on him and will love him forever unconditionally. Some one who would be stuck with him, someone he could ultimately emotionally abuse and manipulate, someone he feels doesn\u2019t have standards, someone he could trap. Ultimately the chaser is an insecure man with little self respect or self confidence.

Generally, most people say 2mg oral is the barrier where more estradiol usually overpowers SERMs like raloxifene, although you could run into issues with more or less. Using a SERM would be able to reverse some swelling and puffiness in early stages, and usually can still have some noticeable effects with well developed gyno.<br><a href=\"#p29022792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29022792</a><br>Cool stuff, im personally getting the same thing done soon.

Bica increases testosterone due to the absence of HPG negative feedback and also causes raises in estradiol from the increased test+increased free test since it cannot bind to androgen receptors. Both these factors allow for more free estradiol to compete with a SERM for the estrogen receptor.<br><br>Also, any thoughts on the photography?", "filename": "lasoagain", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3072, "h": 3634, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672726123250024, "time": 1672726123, "md5": "JF1AR3ykYA6nzKh5zfq5bw==", "fsize": 1411029, "resto": 28970970}, {"no": 29023612, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)01:29:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29023480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29023480</a><br>The photography is nice just shop out the reflections. Are you going to sell lasofoxifene? I have a supply of raloxifene but I bought out the vendor and they never restocked lol so I\u2019m interested in that if you are, and I\u2019m sure many others would be because it seems like people are always looking for serms, especially guys into them for PCT. And if it doesn\u2019t affect hair miniaturization like tamoxifen (that may be because tamoxifen metabolizes into an AI though?). Since you know your shit, do you know if it would be beneficial for telomeres and things like collagen/elastin? I think raloxifene is? Along with estrogen. <br>2mg oral e sounds about right for what serms can stop. I take 1mg e no issue but sublingual gives me a little sensitivity. And just 12.5mg bica monotherapy caused more issues, with less benefits that 1mg e provides. Bica is definitely a powerful and messy drug to take and not something I would wanna be on long term. I was getting all sorts of weird side effects, some good but more bad in a toxic unhealthy feeling kinda way. Probably all the free test in the blood and the messy effects on liver and HPTA.", "time": 1672727396, "resto": 28970970}, {"no": 29024095, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)02:56:58", "name": "Salazar", "com": "<a href=\"#p29023612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29023612</a><br>Thanks, I have a bunch of similar photos and like this lighting but I&#039;m annoyed with the label not showing very well, or at least the important bits on the left.

As for your questions:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PCT</span><br>No, lasofoxifene does not seem very effective at increasing LH/FSH at any normal dosage (literature showed groups taking 10, 30, 100mg per day having increases against placebo, which is ridiculously high compared to a 1mg/day dosage I recommend. Also, this is better for the trans people here who don&#039;t want the testosterone increases from raloxifene.
