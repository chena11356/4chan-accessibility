Like my first memory is following my sister and putting my moms heels and I used to take off my clothes to put on my sisters when I was a toddler. Thats my first memory and I remember nothing else from early childhood. I remember this episode of billy and mandy(I don\u2019t know if zoomers know about this dumb show lol) where they could dive onto someones head and switch bodies and I wanted to d that with a girl; I was probably 7. I remember the first time I saw a crossdresser it was like I was struck by lightning. I couldn\u2019t breathe and suddenly I weighed 1000 pounds. Ive never felt like that since. Thats before puberty and there are more examples like I kept my hair long so people might misgender me. I remember at puberty having a difficult time getting excited over girls and I found tg erotica which made me more turned on than anything by far. Since then its like all I can look at and I don\u2019t know if thats just some porn induced thing or some form of release. I have definitely used it in the past to deal with dysphoria but I don\u2019t know what came first. I remember tripping really hard at 18 and seeing my body turn into a girl\u2019s. I thought \u201coh well I guess everyone will get used to it so its okay\u201d. That day I told someone about my secret and they reacted awkwardly so I learned not to tell anyone. When I was young I was super neglected cause my mom was on drugs and I was scared to tell her as the only parent around. I thought at 18 Id run away and get surgery. During highschool I used to do exercises to make my figure more feminine until I realized how pointless that was. Ive cross dressed since 12 when I can but never had much clothes. I remember in middle school thinking I would care and be a good student if I was a girl-I ended up dropping out of highschool due to extreme depression.

I had a traumatic psychotic break at 18 when I took 1000mg of dxm and went genuinely insane. That fucked me up for two years. After that I just could never find out deep down what I truly was. Nothing felt certain. Ive left long posts like this on here and reddit for like a decade and people always tell me to talk to a therapist. I never got to because Im a neet neglecting the shit out of my life. I desperately search for meaning but I just cant find anything I want. I dont feel many emotions. People scare me.I hate myself intensely. I guess Im just trying to explain why I never moved forward at all. I got my ged but then covid happened. <br><br>Long story short, right now Im very addicted to kratom. Ive kicked my alcoholism cause my body just cant even take one beer anymore. I dont have a license. Ive only ever had one shitty job which I quit for a whole slew of reasons ill spare you the details on. Aside from that Ive only ever been a professional musician who cant drive himself to shows and is too ashamed to give lessons. Im 26 now and Im in no place to move out. I spent all my money cause I was gonna kill my self last year. I cant go somewhere else because I don\u2019t have any income. <br><br>As far as other theories, my life is obviously dogwater and Im pretty deranged. I could justifiably hate myself and want to escape. It could be some emasculating cope. I could just have an ocd obsession over it(I have obsessive OCD), Im probably autistic and could just be tricking myself into thinking Im trans. Maybe Ive spent too much time on 4chan. Like I fucking look at gay porn all the time and dont even know if Im gay. My emotions are so distant from me all I can do is ponder explanations. Nothing ever clicks.

Maybe him punishing me for wearing girls clothes as a kid made it a part of my insecure attachment to him and thus society. Because I couldn\u2019t express it maybe I buried that part of me. Because I was not good enough fr girls maybe my sexuality was buried too and those insecurities became expressed by the same secret act of tg/sissy erotica.

I don&#039;t know what you&#039;ll look like after years of hrt, but you&#039;ll look better than you do now. <br>It&#039;s ok to feel scared and hurt and all this, you&#039;ve gone through a lot and had a tougher life than most. It&#039;s not easy being born a woman but having the entire world gaslight you about it and hurt you for it. That might not make sense to you now but I think it will in the future. Try to take it easier on yourself and imagine you had a good friend who came to you and confessed all this to you. Would you say the same things? Would you call them a freak? You don&#039;t seem like the type who would, so don&#039;t be mean to yourself like that.<br>All I know from you is what you&#039;ve wrote itt but I&#039;m actually crying a bit now because I want you to feel better. Will you do what to need to try to feel better for me if not for yourself?", "time": 1675161953, "resto": 29401771}, {"no": 29407312, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)06:49:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29406851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29406851</a><br>Sorry for missing this at first. I didn\u2019t mean to make you sad. Im too dramatic..<br><br>I am worried that going through with stuff would make me feel really vulnerable. If I had a friend that said all this Id tell them to do what makes them happy. I wish I had more control over my life. I wish <br>I could just get hrt and try it, I might do my best to atleast see how it feels. Society is so scary. Like Im already a recluse but I can\u2019t imagine being a transexual in rural kansas. My neighbors have trump flags and all that. I don\u2019t care what they think ofcourse\u2026 it\u2019s mostly my dad. I stayed a guy because I feel like I have responsibilities to him. Strangely enough I have a trans broth(which makes repressing really hard) but I feel society treats male and female expectations differently.<br><br> If I could do anything, aside from turn back time, Id boy mode and study for some programming job and move out somewhere I could be free with my brother. I don\u2019t know if life as a tall boymoder is easier than repression but I know repression sucks and I fail to get societies respect anyway. Ive just been playing music and games and feel dysphoria creeping up on me. I was wondering if pills would help with that feeling. If I could get rid of that then I wouldn\u2019t need kratom and Id be so much healthier. I actually used to compete in 5ks be a health nut. But I just cant do that with this weight on me.<br><br> Ill tell my brother I want to try hrt just to see how it feels. Hopefully I can keep a secret for a few months.

Ben had a dog that he had dressed up in an alpaca suit and then he had eaten it. Then all of a sudden Australia floated down up into the sky and then all the computers went feral and started eating cheese. They and ate and ate and ate and ate and then they all blew up. Then Ben sneezed and the world blew up and the Adam Sandler (In the movie Click) used his remote to rewind time to the age of dinosaurs and he got eaten up by a piece of dirt.

I only really need to take the ralox for a few years, until I have the means to afford top surgery. My main fear is that hair loss seems to be a notable side effect of serms (less so ralox than tamoxifen), and I keep finding conflicting reports about whether or not they would actually cause hair loss in someone who&#039;s on hrt. I know that ralox increases testosterone, I guess I&#039;m just wondering if the reason for reported hair loss on serms is due to the increase in testosterone levels, or if it&#039;s caused by another mechanism entirely. If so, would an aa that directly lowers test levels (such as cypro) prevent hairfall from ralox? I started hrt about 2 months ago; I noticed a lot of shedding right after starting but I assume that was due to the stress it was putting onto my body, as the hair that did shed started growing back about a week later.

Repeat to yourself when you&#039;re feeling your thoughts start to smile, and in a small way argue against the negative thoughts until you win and then later try to self examine the reasons you felt that way.<br>Repeating a phrase outloud or in your head at least three times will help. Or until you pull yourself out of a shame spiral when those are occurring, and before you go to bed at night.

I like coloring, watching comfy shows while cuddling stuffies, and giving myself permission to feel silly and childish without feeling humiliated and over focusing on sex. I still do experience sexuality; but I changed the way I interact with it. I have a teddy I&#039;ll hump to completion instead of rubbing or buzzing myself constantly while feeling embarassed. It intentionally takes longer, feels more intimate, and tires me out so in post nut I wasn&#039;t immediately rushing to take things off.

At two hours you are falling asleepor really fucking annoyed and stressed. It can get better of course and I always sucked but hope is all about escape.

Giving up desire is terrifying because of the fear of missing out. If the hope is wrong it was for nothing. I literally sat down and did nothing for years without ever getting the relief I hoped for.
