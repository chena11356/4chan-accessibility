I don\u2019t feel male or female which is normal for most people\u2026 we just exist as we are\u2026 but I do have dysphoria and I do naturally blend in as a woman in society. To me transitioning is just growing up, there\u2019s no switch to be made we just grow up into who we are as trans people and our growing up process is a bit more complex but that\u2019s what it is. Even if I said that I am a cis man which I am not I would still have done all my surgeries and ended up the same as I am now\u2026 if I were to detransition into a cis man I wouldn\u2019t want to reverse or change anything or stop taking hrt etc because I didn\u2019t do what I\u2019ve done to \u201cbecome\u201d a woman. This is why detransing makes no sense to me. There is nothing to detrans to<br><br>These professional detransitoners who say the same thing over and over as well as people on r/detrans seem to be very confused and I think we should probably have some gatekeeping because society is encouraging people to transition for the wrong reasons it seems", "time": 1668626953, "resto": 28383146}, {"no": 28384839, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:39:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28384748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28384748</a><br>To add to this transitioning being the same really as growing up is why people who transition later in life are an absolute mystery to me. Yeah everyone matures in various ways in their life at different rates and we see that in the spread of transitioning ages from childhood to mid 20s but beyond that transitioning is very weird behavior to me. I suppose repressing but even then it\u2019s hard to picture.
