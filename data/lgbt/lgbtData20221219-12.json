I mean, I mean partially why I related to HP so much as a kid and teen was because of the inclusivity of outcasts, mythical beasts, etc. Like, a school where anything is possible and good triumphs over evil and magic is everywhere is created by some bigoted asshole who is literally evil, wants rights taken away(ironically to women, just not women she likes), and is in bed with anti lgbtq+ right wing bigots. None of it really makes any sense to me o ther then &quot;money = good&quot;, like how corrupt do you have to be to not only hold a hateful agenda that alienates a large chunk of your fanbase but to just double down on it? Like, even if you aren&#039;t trans she still hangs out with a ton of people who hate other lgbtq+ people so don&#039;t think she just hates transgender people. It also sucks because I was a DIEHARD fan of HP but haven&#039;t watched, played a video game, listened to the music, or anything HP related since because it&#039;s creator is horrible. So she&#039;s not only damaging her career but all of these innocent people who are either impartial or are pro lgbtq+ rights careers are destroyed as collateral. <br>Tl;dr I don&#039;t fucking know<br><br> enjoy this: https://youtu.be/DxeIZutIklQ", "filename": "9117", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 448, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1671443893150375, "time": 1671443893, "md5": "OKp/smI2vRVEh1MoO7evdA==", "fsize": 59357, "resto": 28814891}, {"no": 28815856, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:00:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815796</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My guess is she&#039;s been smoking a lot of weed lately.</span><br>based<br>i love drinking weed<br>im eating taco beef i made (no packaged mix!)<br>with baby arugula, grated sharp cheddar, and avocado on a whole wheat tortilla for my post-yoga meal", "time": 1671444000, "resto": 28814891}, {"no": 28815878, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815847</a><br><br>It is kind of weird how her main villain hates muggle born wizards for being mudblood.<br><br>Like gee, they&#039;re also wizards, magic just as good, but something about their blood, i.e. their genetics makes them impure and invalid.<br><br>Hmmmmmmm now what real world situation does this remind you of?

But nope, despite dumping a fuckton of money on treating her skin, for instance, going through a painful nearly year long course of accutane, she basically destroyed whatever benefits she&#039;s getting from it by always trying to cover up breakouts and whatnot with makeup.", "time": 1671443402, "resto": 28815645}, {"no": 28815850, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)04:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815795</a><br>Fair enough.", "time": 1671443906, "resto": 28815645}, {"no": 28816158, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:04:03", "name": "daughter", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815685</a><br><a href=\"#p28815729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815729</a><br><a href=\"#p28815738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815738</a><br><a href=\"#p28815741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815741</a><br>I&#039;m going to put in more effort.<br><a href=\"#p28815803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815803</a><br>You must be beautiful.<br>Will take care of my skin.", "time": 1671447843, "resto": 28815645}, {"no": 28816324, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:30:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815645</a><br>Mogs me", "time": 1671449436, "resto": 28815645}, {"no": 28816621, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:28:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28815729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28815729</a><br>This + pluck the eyebrows to make them thinner, especially under the ends.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3j<wbr>E0zUUoa0", "time": 1671452917, "resto": 28815645}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28816116, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:57:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Why do repppers rep?", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

It\u2019s so strange seeing the front she puts up and the person underneath. She seemed quite emotionally stoic before we really talked. I said I\u2019m happy to refer to her however she wants in private and in public, and she said okay. We\u2019re going to keep dating. I do like her. Since we talked, she\u2019d cried it out and we decided to lift spirits by putting on stupid Christmas movies. She fell asleep on me. It was nice. I don\u2019t really understand why I feel this way for this person, but I don\u2019t think it matters I suppose. I like spending time with her so I\u2019m not going to second guess things.

And they have very different physical symptoms.<br>Texanon claims to not know what kind of intersexuality he has. This is legitimately preposterous.<br>We know that Tex has intersex genitalia, meaning that he has a &#039;severe&#039; (for lack of a better word) form of intersexuality. This contrasts with some chromosomal forms of intersexuality which have little to no effect on a person&#039;s body, and can go undiscovered for life. Doctors would have noticed Tex&#039;s genitalia while he was in the womb. With Tex&#039;s parents&#039; permission, doctors would have been able to determine exactly what kind of intersexuality Tex had - if not before birth, then soon after. It is highly likely that Tex&#039;s parents would have given permission for these tests because it is medically important information. Different kinds of intersexuality have a profound effect on the body&#039;s interaction with certain medications, risks of medical conditions, cancers, etc. It is vital for a parent to know these things.<br>But okay. Maybe Tex&#039;s parents didn&#039;t get these tests done, or they did, but they never told Tex the results, leaving him unsure. It doesn&#039;t matter, because Tex has been hospitalised multiple times in his life, including as an independent adult. If Texanon couldn&#039;t tell the doctors what kind of intersexuality he has, they would have tested him immediately upon entry and told him the results.

It is ridiculous.<br>There&#039;s no way Texanon is intersex. I would bet money on it.<br>And I think the most interesting question here is: why is he lying? By labelling himself as intersex, Tex has attracted a lot of aggression and ridicule from /gaygen/. Why would someone willingly bring that upon themselves, especially someone like Tex who is so conflict-averse? We know that Texanon has issues with sex - is claiming to be intersex a way of desexualising himself in the gay community?

By highschool I was diagnosed with bpd and given Seroquel which might\u2019ve made things worse as it\u2019s possible I was misdiagnosed as I live without medication now- and I live ok. I would just like to say here that medication is not bad while not for me as a result of my experience but, well, it\u2019s hard to find a real doctor (not a person who just prescribes drugs) these days in the US (atleast by me in the north) if you can find one id really like to say here I would prefer a medicated person to a dead one bar none. Everytime. But that\u2019s not how my story goes. So in high school I was medicated and definitely, whether because I was prone to, or the medication led to, bouts of extreme disassociation which lasted for years(16-22) it wasn\u2019t until I was around 23 that I could really hold a friendship or job in a social way but I was lucky enough to have made semifriends from high school that I could reconnect with however unfruitful that was it led to deeper and longer days where I was so out of it I didn\u2019t even think about hurting myself. I would have major boosts from time to time and did make strides in all Normie aspects but still an extreme NEET. At the time and honestly I still could be if I didn\u2019t care. Homeless for stints as not much to speak of parentally at any point but I would in winter save up to live in \u201cshare houses\u201d we call em up here- basically people looking for roomies but you can pay week for week - not great not stable but I did it and I made me have to getittogether because people don\u2019t wanna live with somebody tragic and I was a pretty soppy story. And honestly I don\u2019t feel much regret over the things that happened (I am sorry for people i wronged) but the choices I made where my own. And I was pretty unattached to my own life.

I attribute that to finally being clear of the medication and I\u2019m curious about who I am more than I hate who I am- it was like meeting myself again as an adult. So I did my best to cut out all the other drugs in my life. And to an extent I did so I could really get to know who I was under and beyond the control I felt drugs (medicated and self medicated) had on me. And was sober for a time. Found I could hold a job and hold a life aswell but I had to treat it like it mattered. I had to actively care. And the more I did, a kind of amazing thing happened, the more I could. It hurt at times but Slowly and definitely (only in retrospect at the time I had no faith or hope it made any difference I pursued out of desperation and curiosity alone but clearly now I can tell) things got better. The people who let me down still did constantly but I no longer felt it was more than THIER shortcoming as inverse to the pain it caused me when I was younger. Sisters steal, brothers lie. But it became a reflection of them NOT a damnation of my worth or importance. I slowly introduced drugs back in just weed and drinking. Had a few partners die and had a few benders (see also the massive drug industry selling basically heroin to people with pain) but I\u2019ve always come back to this pull/push.<br>So when I feel the weight of life \u201cpull\u201d me down with starts and stops in life I don\u2019t desire I \u201cpush\u201d and make sure I do more of the important things(brush teeth, drink less, stretch between games online eta) then I do when I feel less \u201cpull\u201d some people \u201cpush\u201d so hard they never enjoy things in a smell the roses way.

The best form of adoption is adoption within the family for several reasons, as many adopted children will express:<br>1. Medical history. Family medical history is often learned and passed by word of mouth. I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle my eczema or IBS if my mom didn\u2019t have the same issues and have developed habits she passed on that help.<br><br>This is also why if adoption must happen, it\u2019s best to either have it occur within the biological family or have a fostering arrangement that allows family members to visit and help care for the adopted child.<br><br>2. Trauma. Adoption always always causes trauma. Even if you adopt very young, babies know who their biological mother is and crave her presence. And as children get older, the impact of adoption on the psyche can still lead to feelings of rage, isolation, etc. Even adopted children in families that love them still deal with this trauma their whole life.<br><br>3. You are not owed children, and it is selfish to assert you are. Children are agents with feelings, hopes, and preferences. It is natural for humans to prefer to not be adopted, I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true.<br><br>4. The industry targets vulnerable new mothers. There are literally adoption agents (and sometimes even prospective \u201cparents\u201d) who rather than providing support to new mothers and pregnant women, harass them into signing their child away, usually on the condition they never contact the child again and all the child\u2019s records are changed.<br><br>5. Cultural history: humans have a need for culture, and adopted children not raised in the culture they were born into often experience isolation and trauma from not being able to identify with that culture, yet still often looking and even acting the part.<br><br>There are exceptions, and if you find yourself in a place where a child has no choice but to be adopted out, by all means", "time": 1671367655, "resto": 28797122}, {"no": 28803623, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:49:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28803565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28803565</a><br>It\u2019s okay, anon!
