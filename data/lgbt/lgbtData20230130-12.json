The only romances that make my heart flutter are lesbian ones and I find myself identifying with the more masculine woman. <br><br>Too add to the confusion, whenever i dream or do hallucinogens i &#039;meet&#039; a girl with my name (my name is gender neutral). She looks like a girl version of me, dresses like me, etc. But shes happier, less anxious and her presence is calming. <br><br>when it comes to sexuality I&#039;m dominant/masculine but find myself imagining I&#039;m a woman sometimes but then ill catch myself and snap out of it.

Blowjob in the cinema, fucked in a bunch of public toilets, went to a sex club and got a blowjob and then fucked in front of a bunch of old boomers, lots of car sex. They were shockingly subby too, wanted to be choked, wanted to drink piss, would tell me not to bathe before sex sometimes. Every date they&#039;d be caged and sometimes had a remote controlled vibe in their ass, the wore whatever I wanted, went out in skirts and heels and wouldn&#039;t wear panties if I told them. They probably spent the better part of a thousand dollars on clothes while we were together. I spent hundreds on lingerie and thongs and that sort of stuff as gifts. Eventually it just logistically made more sense to start getting airBnBs and just fucking. They were very into me and that&#039;s what made it hot, most of the time I wasn&#039;t ordering them to do something I was basically just giving them permission. They wanted to be nose deep in my bush throating my cock, or letting me use their ass like a cocksleeve. Having a pretty thick cock and only dating cis women up until that point blowjobs were always a favour, whereas with them it was like I was doing them the favour by letting them suck it. Also they were the first person I&#039;ve ever gone raw with. <br>I think basically what made it exceptional is that they were into it, they were a kinky sub but they were not passive.

I think twinks are indeed the peak human aesthetic, estrogenised fat on moid bones. I hesitate to say that I am jealous of trans women, after all, trans women want to pass, so it would be weird to say I am jealous of trans women who don&#039;t quite pass. What has been a bit interesting to explain to MtFs is that, since elven twinkhood is impossible for me, and my options are either woman or twunk manlet, I still much rather be a twunk manlet than a woman. For some MtFs who categorise twinks as closer to women than men, this intrigues them as they assumed that I would just stay a woman if I can&#039;t be a twink.<br><br>I think transbians who &quot;feel guilty for cisles&quot; are victims of the amabs-are-predators hate train, they internalised that they are creeps and predators and feel bad &quot;intruding on lesbian spaces&quot;. Unless I&#039;m getting wrong what you mean by feel guilty. Personally I don&#039;t feel bad/guilty for cis gays, most cis gays are quite calm but firm that they are either simply not attracted to me or don&#039;t see me fully as a man, but they are not dicks about it either. Arguably transphobic sometimes, but if they are not going to be assholes and I am just not meant to hang out in certain spaces, I&#039;m fine with it. I think this does play back into the stereotypical perception of amabs as capable of making their own decisions and not needing to be coddled. Like okay you&#039;re a big boy and you can handle witnessing FtMs at general queer events and you can simply not have sex with said FtMs, it doesn&#039;t kill you or victimise you to exist in the general vicinity of pooners.

atm), literature, generally a fan of sci fi but haven&#039;t read much lately and i wanna get more varied in genres lol (last book i read was snow crash), history, currently reading a book about the black plague, art, trying to learn to draw for fun if i have the free time. also into anime but I like reading manga, webtoons, manhwa&#039;s more than watching anime. also a music fan and my music taste is varied, from wave genres(ie vaporwave, synthwave), metal, rock, psychedelic rock, anime/games osts etc. extremely varied in video game preferences but i like games that i play with friends more. to add to this though i don&#039;t play video games often anymore and i actually rather keep it that way to focus on other stuff. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking for</span><br>people to talk to, potentially frens and all that. been bored and suffering from anxiety lately so i think socializing would probably amend that for me. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not looking for</span><br>creeps, coomers/extreme horniness, relationships maybe?(unless if we realllyyy click with each others but no guarantees on that) <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;QOTT</span><br>used to hear small laughters in my grandma&#039;s house at very late night when everyone was sleeping and it all came from a empty room that had a picture of a women which i always got scared off as a kid, it felt like that picture was genuinely cursed. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(free space) </span><br>i try to respond fast but sorry in advance if i don&#039;t reply fast enough to your messages, i have a very busy schedule this semester so there&#039;s a chance i might be in class or studying plus im a bit shy first time talking to new people. <br><br><span

Equivalence classes [x] are a disjoint partition on any set. This particular one you can think of as a homomorphism \u03d5(x) of addition where ker(\u03d5)=Q.<br>So \u03d5(a+b) = \u03d5(a)+\u03d5(b) = [a]+[b], with the intuitive property that [0]+[x]=[x], as any homomorphism should. For finite sets it becomes pretty obvious that every [x] has the same cardinality, the same is true in the finite case here as well though. Or more pragmatically, every equivalence class can be defined as [r] = {r+q : q \u2208 Q} for any r\u2208R. The reason these sets are a disjoint partition is essentially because R is an additive group, but since that part is of no import since we take it for granted let&#039;s move on. Obviously, [r] is countable. However, that means that K={[r] : r\u2208R} is uncountable. We need a countable partition because our measures only care for countable unions. But if we have UNcountably many countable sets, we could reorder them to countably many UNcountable sets. That is what I meant by vertical slicing: Take one of the uncountably many elements from each [r], but only one, and form a new set of those, called E. That set, by definition, is uncountable, since it has one element from an uncountable number of sets (we can use [r] as an index). However, since we can enumerate the elements in each set [r]={x_{[r], 1},x_{[r], 2},..}, it means that we can form countably many E_n = {x_{[r], n} : [r]\u2208K} (I mean we literally just enumerated them) that are each uncountable (since K is) and together form once again all of R.<br>By restricting r to a finite interval we instead get a decomposition into disjoint unions of something that ought to be measurable (a finite interval). The actual proof just figures out a simple indexing that turns the E_n into translated copies of each other, completing the proof.", "filename": "__loremaster_helltaker_drawn_by_vanripper__ccd1136c83977bdc8a8574a3fa2043d1", "ext": ".png", "w": 660, "h": 748, "tn_w": 110, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675073635133888, "time": 1675073635, "md5": "THZOFEj334sKhwxBg9cKMw==", "fsize": 205609, "resto": 29325927}, {"no": 29393214, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)05:21:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29393183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29393183</a><br>in the infinite case*<br>Take one of the countably many elements from each [r]*", "time": 1675074066, "resto": 29325927}, {"no": 29393447, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)06:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Comic Project day 1 - Update 1<br><br>Goal: Making the panels, speech bubbles and a first draft of the dialog<br> - Bonus goal: loose sketch of the characters<br> - Minimum goal: working on the comic for at least 6 hours<br><br>I do not expect to actually achieve my goal.

The flipside though is that male puberty makes you far likelier to be a hon.

I&#039;m looking to minimize breast growth on hrt; I&#039;m currently taking 2mg e 200mg spiro &amp; 60mg ralox daily. I only really need to take the ralox for a few years, until I have the means to afford top surgery. My main fear is that hair loss seems to be a notable side effect of serms (less so ralox than tamoxifen), and I keep finding conflicting reports about whether or not they would actually cause hair loss in someone who&#039;s on hrt. I know that ralox increases testosterone, I guess I&#039;m just wondering if the reason for reported hair loss on serms is due to the increase in testosterone levels, or if it&#039;s caused by another mechanism entirely. If so, would an aa that directly lowers test levels (such as cypro) prevent hairfall from ralox? I started hrt about 2 months ago; I noticed a lot of shedding right after starting but I assume that was due to the stress it was putting onto my body, as the hair that did shed started growing back about a week later.
