I also notice that this behavior intensifies in the winter, in conjunction with my overall mood and motivation dropping.<br>So, is there any good way to cull or reduce these kinds of reactions without therapy?", "time": 1674611547, "resto": 29320183}, {"no": 29321246, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:55:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29320183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29320183</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;QOTT1</span><br>no but there&#039;s always time<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;QOTT2</span><br>same amount as you<br>QOTT that makes sense: in what year was your (chosen) name the most popular?", "time": 1674611729, "resto": 29320183}, {"no": 29321284, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just in case<br><a href=\"/lgbt/thread/29308102#p29308200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29308200</a> #<br><a href=\"/lgbt/thread/29308102#p29308509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29308509</a> #<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"/lgbt/thread/29308102#p29314041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29314041</a> #</span><br>Find ways to increase pleasure (which varies by person, for me it was just really strong vibrators that would overwhelm me with pleasure so I didn&#039;t have time to think about dysphoria)<br>Find ways to decrease dysphoria (keep clothes on, don&#039;t touch those areas, affirm that they&#039;re still a man despite those areas, compliment male features of them)<br>Find ways to work around the dysphoria (prosthetics, calling their genitals a penis, etc)<br>Sex doesn&#039;t have to be piv. I usually kept my clothes on and just did oral. I ended up getting super into specific kinks and bdsm because that&#039;s a way to have sex that completely bypasses the genital aspect.<br>Prosthetics also helped a ton, and pretending that the prosthetics were real. I&#039;d pretend I was doing anal when getting vaginally penetrated and my partner would go along with it and said she was fucking my prostate.

I live with my religious parents, still. I come from an upper middle class family and it&#039;s very uncommon in my country for people from this background to move out or get employed before they complete their college education (unless they moved to a different city to go to college itself, where their parents pay for their expenses). Because of this, I haven&#039;t had any significant source of income (only got internships and some money I get from my parents) that would allow me to build a safety net so that if I came out and shit went south I could escape. I thankfully got hired by a company from another country recently, which means I&#039;ll be receiving first-world salary while living in a third-world country, so this will allow me to build my safety net way faster than expected and if everything goes right I&#039;ll be going through the process of coming out and starting HRT in the latter half of this year.<br><a href=\"#p29331407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29331407</a><br>Thank you for the kind words, anon, and I do hope what I said can resonate with people who are in a similar situation right now.

I go to art school, so I&#039;ve argued way too many times about which programs are best. <br>My personal most used programs are Procreate on the iPad and Paint Tool Sai on the PC. However, I wouldn&#039;t reccomend Paint Tool Sai to everyone. I like it because it has insanely good blending that literally no other art program has managed to replicate, even though it&#039;s an old and very simple program. If you don&#039;t want to do paintings I wouldn&#039;t reccomend it and even if you do it&#039;s probably best for you to learn and get used to a more complete program than it anyway, even if they have inferior blending.<br>Clip Studio Paint is by far the most complete art program we have, in my opinion. I haven&#039;t used it very often because I hate having to learn a new program when I just want to draw, but if you&#039;re looking for a program to learn this is the one I&#039;d reccomend. It even has pretty good animation features, if you&#039;re into that.<br>Photoshop is not an art program and never will be. I&#039;ve argued about this multiple times. The brush engine is absolute shit. The blending is horrible. It is the most complete option in terms of photo manipulation and all that so I can see why some people use it, but I still don&#039;t like it as an art program.<br>Krita is free, and that&#039;s pretty much what it has going for it. It&#039;s leagues better than Paint.NET, and the animation feature in it is pretty usable, too. I like the blending here better than Photoshop blending but even Clip is better, IMO.<br>People who use Corel Painter are insane, but I haven&#039;t used it enough to talk about it myself. I don&#039;t like Adobe Fresco, but I am biased against Adobe and have not tested it too much myself, either.

My current one is a Wacom Intuos CTL-4100. My previous one was a Wacom Intuos CTL-480 but I broke it from lugging it around to college all the time (you should always avoid putting weight on top of the tablet to not fuck it up, but I had to carry it around with my notebook and books and shit happens. They usually last a long time under normal circumstances). All Wacom tablets are pretty good but they&#039;re slightly overpriced, but I think the prices might be fine in the US? Lots of my peers use Huion tablets and they&#039;re decent as well but if you have the cash to buy Wacom, I&#039;d go for it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i couldnt even see what i was drawing</span><br>Don&#039;t know if you&#039;re talking about display-less tablets in this, but honestly, I learned to enjoy them. They take a bit to get used to but once you get the hang of it, it&#039;s very nice to not have your hand in the way. They&#039;re always cheaper, too. But if you really truly want a tablet that has a display, and only want to draw and paint and not do animation or 3D sculpting and shit like that, I&#039;d get an iPad instead of getting a display drawing tablet for your computer. I find those can be a bit clunky to use if you don&#039;t have a good physical space for it (a big ass fucking desk) and an iPad is portable, at least.<br><a href=\"#p29334112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29334112</a><br>Lucien and Florian are pretty bad, but i like Julien if we change the spelling to Julian.

The easiest way is to do it in conversation with other people. Your biggest obstacle here is burnout, and conversations solve this by keeping you from getting bored and keeping you from listening to the sound of your cringe unpracticed trannyvoice for hours at a time. Try to just have conversations with other troons (or cis people you trust not to judge you).

As for interactions with cis people, most of my trans friends don&#039;t say anything until a lie becomes necessary (like lying about also having periods), then they choose to out themselves as trans rather than to lie. But this is in cases where the cis person doesn&#039;t have power over them, e.g. that it wouldn&#039;t complicate their work life. If you just meet some rando at a party and they turn out to be transphobic after you came out to them, you can just stop talking to them and there is no social fallout anyway for example. When you keep your work life entirely separate from the rest of your life, and your social life comprises of other trans people, there is very little that transphobic cis people outside of your work environment can do to you.

Sometimes this requires moving away. You don&#039;t tell your new coworkers and new friends that you are trans, and lie when necessary to keep them thinking you are cis. Although usually even for deep stealth it becomes necessary to come out as trans to your romantic partner, some deep stealth people thus choose never to date.<br><br>It is considered a more extreme solution but it does mean that basically no one knows you are trans and so there is very low chance of you being outed and you are completely treated as cis. Some people only go deep stealth after they have secured a romantic partner who knows they are trans, and they trust that partner to keep that fact to themselves.<br><br>Most trans people seem to do semi-stealth instead, which is to go to work but barely socialise there and be presumed cis. Then keep a separate social life where their friends are pre-filtered to be trans-accepting (sometimes this means sticking to other trans people) and being openly trans there. They also usually come out to family members and old friends who matter to them, to give those a chance to accept them as trans, then decide based on reaction whether to keep those people in their lives. <br><br>But some deep stealth people do not do semi-stealth, as they fear that anyone at all knowing they are trans, might react badly in ways that result in social fallout, or may accidentally leak the fact to others. <br><br>As for &quot;what personality is good for deep stealth&quot;, a person suited for deep stealth is someone who doesn&#039;t see their birth sex or being trans as anything significant at all (as opposed to a core part of their identity), doesn&#039;t mind telling small lies, doesn&#039;t feel lonely as a result of telling said small lies, isn&#039;t too focused on personal authenticity and honesty, and has poor/loose/no social ties to their pre-trans lives.", "time": 1674721776, "resto": 29335427}, {"no": 29338203, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:30:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29338192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29338192</a><br>I had nothing to do with it.

This includes the pursuit of vanity, something granted to women as they are valued solely on their inherent tangible qualities and their capacity to bear children. Men recognize it as a lower pursuit than that of knowledge or practical skill, and women internalize this evaluation.
