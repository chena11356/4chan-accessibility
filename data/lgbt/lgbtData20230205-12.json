was growing up on 4chan or shitty upbringing but in my head i always separated trans girls into two groups trans women that identify as trans women and trans women that call themselves women exclusively. <br><br>the girl i&#039;m dating started transitioning 3+ years ago she always identified as a trans woman she never wanted bottom surgery, she never wanted me to play with her dick during sex. everything was fine. now im 25 and i&#039;ve gone above and beyond to stay femme looking, almost exclusively cardio. i&#039;m 5&#039;7 58kg. she liked that about me she was the one that approached me first actually. recently though when we&#039;re at the gym she tries to push me to do more weight lifting and more reps when i do. <br><br>in the last 2-3 months out of nowhere i&#039;ve seen her taste in porn change drastically from femboys, twinks, trans on trans stuff to some of the most vanilla shit imaginable like brazzers tier porn, buff dude, cis girl. she&#039;s also been floating around the idea of having bottom surgery. <br><br>so now i&#039;m in a place where i&#039;m insecure because suddenly my girlfriend is attracted to literally the polar opposite of what i am. she is floating around the idea of having bottom surgery which i find disgusting. and when i bring up the recent rather sudden changes she just handwaves them away like she&#039;s just bored of the normal stuff she watches and she&#039;s thinking bottom surgery might help with her dysphoria. she&#039;s cute, i&#039;d say only other trans people would be able to clock her. my parents had no clue and we never brought it up. <br><br>i dont wanna make a big issue out of it but i&#039;m not planning on lifting weights and becoming a jacked dudebro. and i&#039;m all out of ideas on how to approach

Sure, you&#039;re technically fucking them, but you&#039;re their sex toy and all she had to do to make me a total bottombrained sub for her was grab my face or neck and say &quot;Tell me you&#039;re my good little boy&quot;. Thankfully she didn&#039;t or I would have embarrassed myself massively by telling her I&#039;ll always be her good little boy. Imagine getting topped by a 19 year old girl that has your dick inside her, who wasn&#039;t even trying to top you and was just grinding her hips. Holy shit I&#039;m going to cum.<br>So yeah, the point of this was, well I forgot. I guess that ultimately it&#039;s about sexual dynamics but when you are a skeleton then you can&#039;t invert anything. Looking back I can explain in detail why it was so hot, but she was at the time just a cute girl who liked me because I made sure she was safe by walking her to the taxi rank one night, and she got a crush on me. She didn&#039;t want to dom me, and we never acknowledged that was what happened, but it did and I don&#039;t even know if she knows it. It just happened. And that&#039;s what&#039;s sexy, the ambitiousness and uncertainty of it all.<br>So no it&#039;s actually about power dynamics and not muscle or bodyfat distribution.", "time": 1675560716, "resto": 29470316}, {"no": 29471180, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)20:34:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29470603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29470603</a><br>All that tells me is you&#039;ve got face blindness", "time": 1675560841, "resto": 29470316}, {"no": 29471512, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:00:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29471155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29471155</a> (me)<br>Please for the love of god someone reply to this because I even had to edit it to make it fit, I need to know how it makes you feel.", "time": 1675562459, "resto": 29470316}, {"no": 29471532, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:02:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29471155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29471155</a><br>(You)", "time": 1675562558, "resto": 29470316}, {"no": 29471566, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:05:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29470316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29470316</a><br>I have the same body type but better chest.

The numbers aren&#039;t clean which is a huge red flag.<br>There are 4 forces acting on the car at point C; the braking force, the centripetal force, normal force, and gravity. Assuming the road is flat, gravity and the normal force cancel out. That leaves us the braking force and centripetal force.<br>There are two tricky parts to this problem, the first is that we are given a changing acceleration, so the kinematic equations is going to be less plug and play. Secondly, we have to solve for the radius of the arc.<br><br>Rearranging the kinematics eqn, we get the following:<br>-1/48*t^3 + 30*t - 100 = 0 where the only valid answer of t (between 0 and 15) is 3.35967 seconds. (I used an online calculator to solve the cubic)<br><br>We are now able to figure out the new acceleration and velocity at point B, which is -0.42 m/s^2 (plug time into the acceleration function) and 20.29m/s .<br><br>Now from B to C, we know we have 11.64s to get there. We can then just plug that value into our kinematic eqn:<br><br>-1/48 (11.64)^3 + -0.42(11.64)^2 + 29.2944(11.64) + 0 = 251.225 m<br><br>We will also need to find the velocity at C which is:<br>(-1/16)(11.64^2) +(-1/8)*11.64 + 29.2944 = 19.3713 m/s<br><br>Now we need the radius of the arc:<br>251m/0.785 = 320.0m<br><br>Finally we can compute the centrifugal acceleration:<br>(19.373)^2/320.0 = 1.173m/s^2<br><br>The other force (braking) is more straight forward to compute:<br>-1/8*15 = -1.875 m/s^2<br>Now, the brakes are applying the force tangent to the circle, while the centrifugal force is pointing towards the center of the circle. This basically means that the two forces are perpendicular to one another, so to sum the total acceleration, we are going need use a^2 + b^2 = c^2.<br><br>sqrt(1.875^2 +1.173^2) = 2.211 m/s^2", "time": 1675589188, "resto": 29472016}, {"no": 29475474, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)04:32:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29472016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29472016</a><br>i&#039;ll just say at least 2 bc i can only do basic math and don&#039;t even understand half the question", "time": 1675589576, "resto": 29472016}, {"no": 29475490, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)04:36:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29475434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29475434</a><br>*centripetal acceleration<br>Not centrifugal force.

No idea why there is a point B but read the question, it plays absolutely no role whatsoever.<br><br>This leaves us with the only real information we have: acceleration from breaking and 15 seconds of breaking.

To be clear, this type of hair is already low maintenance and naturally straight.<br><br>Layered haircuts is a good start.<br>If you see frizz, usually it&#039;s too many split ends or dry hair. Get a trim or use oil/leave-in conditioner to treat these respectively.<br><br>I wash my hair every 2-3 days, any more and you strip too much of your natural oils which keeps your hair hydrated and looking nice. This is not a hard rule, if your hair starts feeling really greasy/dirty/weighed down, just wash it.<br>I really liked using OGX coconut oil shampoo for a long time, but recently switched to Jupiter pythrione zinc shampoo because it helps my skin condition. But in general I think any sulfate-free shampoo is a good pick, again trying to preserve your scalp&#039;s natural oils.<br>Shampooing is root to end, make sure you massage the scalp too. You may want to look into a scalp massager you keep in the shower to help with this. Rinse ALL of the shampoo out when you&#039;re done.<br><br>For conditioner I kind of just do whatever, I switch up a lot. My hair type lets me be pretty flexible on conditioner imo, but you may want to get something more specific to your needs. <br>Applying the conditioner goes from the middle of your hair strands to the ends. DO NOT do the roots. This unnecessarily weighs down your hair and makes it hard to achieve volume. It also makes it hard for your roots to absorb scalp oils. Now, leave the conditioner in for 5-15m before rinsing it out. I usually wash my body during this time.<br><br>After I shower I try to pat my hair dry with my towel. I also untangle my hair with a comb, depending on your hair type you might like a brush more. If your strands are more brittle you may want to consider wrapping them in a towel or t-shirt. <br>When I&#039;m done with my skincare routine I roughly style/set my hair (while it&#039;s wet) in the way I want it to look for the next couple of days.

\u0653Additionally, since the integral from epsilon to 1 diverges to positive infinity as epsilon approaches 0, the area underneath 1/2x is decidedly larger than the area under f(x) on the interval (0, 1), so there must be some x2 in (0, 1) for which f(x2) &lt; 1/2x2. Assuming that neither of these are solutions would mean that f(x1) &gt; 1/2x1 and f(x2) &lt; 1/1 + x2, but because f is continuous, f(x) must take every value between f(x1) and f(x2) on the interval (x1, x2)/(x2, x1) (depending on which is greater). Since 1/1+x and 1/2x do not intersect on the interval (0, 1), this means that f(x) must cross a gap at some point in between these values, and in this gap there must be some x0 where 1/1+x0 &lt; f(x0) &lt; 1/2x0.
