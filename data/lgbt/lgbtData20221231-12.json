His idea of the absurd is intriguing to me because the question of suicide is kind of personal.

I can only speak from my own experience, but just changing appearances, even quite dramatically, isn&#039;t necessarily going to make someone happy or comfortable. It might seem easy for me of all people to say, but working out and achieving fitness goals didn&#039;t really make me any more secure with my image. There&#039;s a lot of things that I can find about myself to criticize, to be insecure about, and if I let my thoughts get out of control, I would become neurotic about them to the point of an eating disorder, for example. When I was younger and got made fun of for being &quot;the chubby kid,&quot; I would look down at my stomach and grab the fat hanging there, and just feel miserable about it. I still sometimes look down at my stomach and all I see is that layer of fat that just won&#039;t go away.

I would suggest either keeping a library of media around (to avoid sacrificing mobile data for downloading I would suggest maybe a caf\u00e9 or other place with free wifi. Coffee is also a good appetite suppressant if you can resist the temptations of adding anything).

What you\u2019re referring to as pedophilia, is in fact, hebephilia, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, ephebophilia. Pedophilia is not merely the attraction to anyone under 18, but rather a totally separate disorder (not a legal term) listed as a sexual-psychological disorder categorized under paraphilias, a group of sexual-psychological disorders in the DSM-V and considered a disorder under the standards of the American Psychological Association. Many people could be considered ephebophiles despite the fact that they themselves may not know the term, much less what it means. Through a peculiar turn of events, ephebophilia and hebephilia became grouped under the very general and inconclusive cultural term &quot;pedophilia,&quot; and the majority of people using the term are unaware that they are referring to non-paraphilic sexual preferences that are unmentioned in the DSM-IV and occur relatively harmlessly in a great deal of the population. There really is a pedophilia, and these people may be referring to it, but nevertheless it is a small part of what is labeled under &quot;pedophilia.&quot; Pedophilia is labeled as a paraphilia because it is by nature unhealthy. Paraphilias are all unhealthy and destructive to relationships, but are restricted to the definitions set forth in the DSM. Pedophilia is simply grouped with the non pathologized conditions of hebephilia and hebephilia because they share a few similar traits. In reality, pedophilia separate from both and should be treated as such, and many people described as pedophiles would be better described as hebephiles or ephebophiles.", "time": 1672486961, "resto": 28976962}, {"no": 28980435, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)06:44:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28980393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28980393</a><br>Biological puberty \u2260 psychological maturity.

wiggers. I do have autism, but with a lot of work I realized how cool I really am and stopped beating myself up for being different. A lot of people always want to be friends with me, even though I don&#039;t understand why and often consider people acquaintances when they think we are close friends. Anyway, through starting my career in cyber security, focusing on my passions more, making money and working out I&#039;ve stopped being socially awkward. I was on government assistance 1.5 years ago, on a helpdesk for 8 months, now have an ebin h4x0r job that doubled my salary to college-grad tier. Worth noting I was hikkineet balls deep in alt-chans for around 7 years.

I would also like to find a tranner with similar interests to me but maybe different area; maybe someone more into webdesign or something artsy to do with computers.
