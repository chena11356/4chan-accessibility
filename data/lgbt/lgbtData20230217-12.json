I just went along with girls who came on to me because I was trying to convince myself that I&#039;m a straight guy and I am attracted to them enough at least and I really like hanging out with them as friends and dating them let&#039;s me do that. It sucks though because it&#039;s like constant jealousy and a reminder that that&#039;s not what I am.<br><br>I think I have body dysmorphia or something so I don&#039;t even know what way I&#039;m attractive in exactly. I really hope it&#039;s not the masculine manly man kind of attractive and that it&#039;s more of the pretty boy attractive. The latter is what I go for in presentation anyways, I have shoulder length hair I take good care of and I arch my brows and wear concealer and shave my body hair and stuff like that. I think I act kind of faggy too, or just look that way, a lot of people have thought I was gay. Every girl I&#039;ve been with has been bi too so maybe that&#039;s it... I really hope it is. I wish someone could just definitively tell me if I&#039;d pass as a woman and that I&#039;d look okay, I want it so bad but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d look like a freak.", "time": 1676339327, "resto": 29588857}, {"no": 29603029, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:08:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29602350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29602350</a><br>I get compared to some celebrities and have walked into relationships basically on accident, didn\u2019t end well for me so I got smarter about it<br>guess I\u2019m a volcel<br>exclusively into guys so I remained a virgin", "time": 1676340480, "resto": 29588857}, {"no": 29603100, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)21:15:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29602350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29602350</a><br>I attract the type of cute girls a normal person would marry, like they flirt and are overly nice and shit, but i cant see myself dating a girl and taking on the man role and penetrating anyone sounds gross so im a khhv volcel ig", "time": 1676340918, "resto": 29588857}, {"no": 29603977, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:19:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p29603100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;29603100</a><br>I hate penetration but I do it anyways if the girl I&#039;m with wants it.

I think I&#039;m done fighting it. Some trans women have told me I could pass, some people have told me I look pretty in makeup, my build is very feminine for being male, everyone thinks I&#039;m like 19-20 instead of 28, and I just malefailed to someone who was looking at my face.

i mean im also somewhat masculine sometimes, but i was a gay guy pretransition and only gained attraction to women due to estrogen, so im somewhat more feminine than the average transbian, but i honestly love that about them. how they dont care about how masculine they sound, its even better if they pass since they achieve that tomboy aesthetic that no cis woman can reach and honestly only exists in tv shows, cartoons and anime. i once read a book about a lesbian assassin and she was so cool and malebrained but then i remembered how no cis woman on earth would act like that and got sad.. but trannies who act like that exist! i guess you just gotta stop expecting complete womanhood and feminimity from people who were raised and socialized male and have male body parts. if you want the lesbian experience date a cis lesbian, but then again, most of them dont like us and then, usually our masculinity comes out on contrast with their feminimity and now suddenly were the &quot;man&quot; of the relationship.<br><br>then again, if you cant handle a transbian, then either date a fembrained bi tranny or a cis male. youre bi!

Example: Suppose you had arranged to meet some friends at the mall, but on the day of the meeting your grandma died.

You&#039;re not obliged to go and comfort your mother, and yet you&#039;d be being inconsiderate if you ignored her grief and instead went to have fun. <br>The point is, when deciding on whether to prioritize what makes you feel good and what makes other people you care about feel good, you&#039;re expected (not obliged) to balance it out according to how much you like them. Since many anon&#039;s see virginity as not something that important, they&#039;re seeing her as putting her own desires (being a virgin) too much weight and her date&#039;s desires (getting intimate with her and having sex) too little, even though she supposedly cares about her date as a person.<br>In my opinion, to be considerate, she doesn&#039;t even need to have sex with him, but at the very least she could communicate her feelings to him.
