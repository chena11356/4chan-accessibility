But no one suffers more than the asexual. Everywhere I go I see people say \u201cwe all masturbate and if you say you don\u2019t you are lying\u201d, \u201call men watch porn, don\u2019t lie\u201d or \u201call men think about sex all the time, and if they say they don\u2019t they are lying\u201d. \u201cWe all crave sex\u201d, \u201cWe are all horny\u201d.\u2019<br><br>No fucking fuck off. I\u2019m not lying, I\u2019m not trying to feel superior. I\u2019m not religious, hell I\u2019m not even conservative. But all of you horny fuckers who accuse me of lying because I\u2019m not some degenerate coomer can fuck the hell off. I hate modern society. I can\u2019t watch a movie for 10 minutes before it gets sexual. I can\u2019t read 4chan for 5 minutes before seeing porn. I can\u2019t even fucking read books without it turning sexual half way through. Society thinks about sex all the time and I fucking suffer. I\u2019m not conservative but I would fucking love to live in the 1800 where it all was taboo. I suffer immensely. 1% of the population is asexual and only 0.18% are asexual men. I know not a single person like me. Doesn\u2019t help all the asexual women are social hermits who never go outside their house so I never see them. I suffer.
