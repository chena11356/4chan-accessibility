There&#039;s no possible reality where me transitioning ends up well. I can&#039;t say I have fully accepted that but I know it isn&#039;t going to change and ultimately it&#039;s the fact I come back to every time there are any cracks in the armor.<br><br>Along with acceptance I think there are some little things you can allow yourself to give you a little bit of feminine expression in your life. The way I act when I&#039;m alone is rather different from how I act when I&#039;m around other people. I also don&#039;t think you have to consider your male body your enemy. You can have pride in your fitness and how you look if you take care of yourself. Men&#039;s fashion isn&#039;t as fun but I think it can still give you somewhat of an outlet. Being a well-dressed man can be rewarding in a way that most men never get because they never try. I guess what I&#039;m trying to get at is that you need the find the things you can enjoy despite everything.

But their liberation from women&#039;s courtship demands and the responsibility of fatherhood enables them to indulge in masculine desires past what is socially accepted. This includes the pursuit of vanity, something granted to women as they are valued solely on their inherent tangible qualities and their capacity to bear children. Men recognize it as a lower pursuit than that of knowledge or practical skill, and women internalize this evaluation. As such, they disqualify men who practice it deriding them as &quot;unmasculine&quot; or &quot;self absorbed&quot; or &quot;macaronis&quot; etc. <br><br>Gay men are not bound to that standard, and as the subjects of their own sexuality, they are enabled to embrace their appearance.

(Speaking from a transfeminine perspective but I\u2019d imagine much of this applies to other trans people as well) You can make a character, (including gender) fight against regressive facists,(sic) (Caesar\u2019s legion) and meet plenty of other LGBT people along the way that are actually well rounded characters! Most of the LGBT people in this game, you wouldn\u2019t even know they were LGBT unless you took the time to talk to them and get to know them. Your character can be canonically gay or bi with the use of certain perks too! Most importantly, the world and its major factions are ambivalent enough to be believable. Of course we hate the legion! They would kill us given the chance, but NCR isn\u2019t perfect either\u2026 They exploit their workers, they\u2019re xenophobic and imperialistic. House is a dictator just like Caesar, right? Well\u2026 maybe you hate autocracy, but House seems benevolent and has the best interest of humanity in mind. You could ultimately side with yourself and play God with the wasteland. Why not? Even in this virtual world where we are allowed to be ourselves, for many of us much more than in the everyday world, we can also be Gods! People listen to us, our actions have meaning and consequences that feel plausible. That\u2019s why I think trans people in particular love this game. Honestly it is a work of art that all should appreciate, but trans people through our heightened need for self integration just to justify and understand our existence, develop a greater appreciation of art. That is why trans people love New Vegas.", "time": 1674803983, "resto": 29349926}, {"no": 29351603, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:22:39", "name": "Rank 1 Boymoder", "com": "<a href=\"#p29349926\"
