An analogy for quantum entanglement is this: imagine you amputate your arm, and ship it to China for analysis. They store it. You, in the USA, send a brain signal through your CNS to wiggle your finger in your amputated arm. The amputated arm responds and wags its finger.<br><br>The concept of a &quot;wormhole&quot; comes from a so-called &quot;einstein-rosen bridge&quot;.

You alter the state of one particle, and the other immediately follows tow, regardless of distance. In contrast, with a wormhole you create a portal from one region to another.<br><br>In sum, quantum entanglement requires at least two objects, whose intrinsic behaviors are coupled.

Like turning out the lights in a room, they subtracted the light from stars, galaxies, planets and the zodiacal light. Surprisingly, a ghostly, feeble glow was left over. It&#039;s equivalent to the steady light of ten fireflies spread across the entire sky. One possible explanation is that a shell of dust envelops our solar system all the way out to Pluto, and is reflecting sunlight. Seeing airborne dust caught in sunbeams is no surprise when cleaning the house. But this must have a more exotic origin. Because the glow is so smoothy distributed, the likely source is innumerable comets\u00e2&quot;free-flying dusty snowballs of ice. They fall in toward the sun from all different directions, spewing out an exhaust of dust as the ices sublimate due to heat from the sun. If real, this would be a newly discovered architectural element of the solar system. It has remained invisible until very imaginative and curious astronomers, and the power of Hubble, came along.

While this filter is mainly anthropomorphic, the language filter is an interesting problem, I think.<br><br>It is commonly believed that language and writing are important because it allows people to spread knowledge, create ideas, conjecture new ones, and error-correct upon other ideas. This is true because 1) without language, we would not be able to communicate efficiently to our brethren that, say in the cavemen era, &quot;This area over here is full of lions, don&#039;t go there!&quot; or &quot;this area is full of deer, let&#039;s hunt here,&quot; and 2) without writing, we would have a hard time accumulating knowledge because people would die and thus their knowledge dies with them. <br><br>But the problem with both language and writing, at least to humans, is that both methods of communications are linear, despite the fact that the universe is non-linear. Take for example the paragraph I wrote above: notice how it progresses in a straight-forward fashion. Or look at any complete sentence and how it flows in a linear fashion: subject, verb, and object\u2014Mary sucks cock.<br><br>This limits our abilities to understanding the universe because the universe is not strictly linear. And because we speak and write in a linear fashion, we are thus misinterpreting the universe everyday. <br><br>One counter-argument: we interpret the universe through our sense, thus interpreting the universe nonlinearly. We soak in our environment through sight, hearing, smelling, touch, and more. This goes to show that the brain is completely capable of understanding the universe in a nonlinear fashion. But the counter-argument against the counter-argument is that our senses are easily manipulatable.<br><br>For use to pass the language filter, we need a method of understanding the universe in its nonlinear operation of itself, to &quot;see&quot; everything all at once, as opposed to a linear approach.", "filename": "0yjG34n5W933ZtVp0UNFR85-5joDidCqvC74MXEpGog", "ext": ".png", "w": 750, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 107, "tim": 1670652080480328, "time": 1670652080, "md5": "LTJ3W5r8fa7KBIX9qJ1DLQ==", "fsize": 157719, "resto": 15042707}, {"no": 15042770, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)01:13:21", "name": "bias", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042757</a><br>I live for 100,000 years, and can reproduce for over 90,000 of them.

Or are you asking if there&#039;s even a need for writing in the first place? Nonetheless, I will attempt to answer both.<br><br>Why did we develop writing? _Why_ questions are hard to answer because it would make an &quot;answer&quot; too overly deterministic. There are many approaches to why we developed writing. One reason: we had to accurately keep track of each other\u2014who was indebted, who said what, who promised what, etc, &quot;It was written and agreed upon in stone,&quot; type of scenario. Second: efficient learning\u2014it is easier to read at 1000+ words per minute than to speak 1000+ words per minute, let alone 300. Third: messaging each other\u2014easier to write a scroll and have someone deliver it across villages than it was to travel and speak in person. Fourth, similar to the third reason: mass distribution of knowledge\u2014easier to print 10,000 scrolls and have each scrolls repeatedly read by others, than it was to speak to a small audience. There are plenty of other reasons, but the gist is that writing allows people to &quot;clone&quot; themselves and have that clone do the communicating.<br><br>As for needing writing in the first place? I think there are faster means of communications, such as sight, which acts upon the speed of light, but inherently slowed by electro-chemical processes of the brain, but is still faster than writing. Perhaps there&#039;s a way for people to communicate without directly speaking or writing to each other via internet-like telepathy. Or perhaps a flashdrive that you could plug into others. DNA for accumulation of knowledge is a rather slow process because it is almost strictly chemical.

Our planet remains a tectonically and volcanically active world -- witness the current eruptions in Hawaii -- while Mars has been a cold, geologically dead place for the past three billion years. That was the thinking at least. But a new paper in Nature Astronomy challenges that accepted wisdom. Mars, it suggests, may still be geologically active today. The findings are the result of orbital photography, surface data, and computer modeling of a lowland region near the Martian equator known as Elysium Planitia -- where NASA&#039;s Mars InSight probe landed in 2018. Researchers from the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory analyzed recordings of Mars quakes taken by InSight and concluded that they all result from a series of subsurface fissures dubbed Cerberus Fossae, which stretch nearly 1,300 km (800 mi.) across the Martian surface. This gives rise to what are known as mantle plumes: blob-like masses of molten rock that rise to reach the base of the crust, causing quakes, faulting, and volcanic eruptions.
