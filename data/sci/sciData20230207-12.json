So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

They don&#039;t sell products to consumers, they just print money, so they do not do layoffs in the same way that companies do.<br><br>2) Healthcare: This makes sense as during tough economic times, people die more. Therefore you have more work.<br><br>3) Finance: Tough financial times just means you need better financial managers so this adds up.<br><br>4) Consumer Staples: These are products that everyone needs/wants even during the toughest times. Could even include some luxury consumer goods if there is already an existing wealthy consumer base that will support it.<br><br>5) IT: Our world runs in tech so it makes sense that you need the people to still manage these systems.<br><br>If you work in one of these industries, or are somehow attached, you may be safer than others. However, there is one other rule to follow: do not be TOO specialized. For example, IT is one of the most recilient industries. That may seem weird when you look at the current wave of layoffs however you have to realize that the layoffs are mainly coming for highly skilled engineers that are simply not needed right now. There are just a limited amount of cutting-edge tech products to work on right now. However, the guy that simply maintains the database is still very much needed.

I&#039;m not too sure how much it&#039;s tied to US milliteary, but if its a job outside the US it will probably be for whatever country they&#039;re in in which they will specialize their tech in. Since these companies are international you can probably join Raytheon and see if you they can let you jump to the US on a non-cleared role. I don&#039;t know the specifics desu, I just know theres joint programs and some rotations are outside the US.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, last one thing. Do you have any advice regarding how I could broaden my horizons in mech eng, that could be useful no matter what field I&#039;d end up pursuing? Any books or something? Sorry for not being specific, it&#039;s just that my degree was only loosely related to mech eng, I had few subjects related to that and I already forgot most of the stuff I had learned there.</span><br>I actually wouldn&#039;t know how to help you here.

They experienced a dual shock earthquake, which are so fucking rare when they happen. 7.8 followed by nearly half a day passing before the 7.5 further along a fault ruptured. With a 6.5 aftershock on the first and two 6.0 after shocks for the second. With no real building codes to withstand the quakes, and subsequent aftershocks, up to 200km from the epicenter you can find buildings flattened. Early reports had stated that something like close to 11,000 people died in the first 40 seconds of the earthquake.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

alternative medicine or incoherently made up as a poor reconstruction in the 20th century. traditional medicine was also constantly evolving according to theories, religion/beliefs, knowledge of ingredients and symptoms, technology, etc.<br><br>the medicine we have today arises out of western traditional medicine. which was rapidly developed into something more systematic and effective by monasteries and other institutions. and the traditional medicines are categorically no different to medicine today. they used models, observed symptoms, diagnosed diseases, used medicines and treatments with certain repeatable effects, etc. though their models were primitive, it does not make them useless when you have a living intellectual and empirical tradition that is refining them. for this reason acupuncture and many other things swayed in popularity in china and the 20th century acupuncture was extinct outside of western alternative medicine, which is where so-called traditional chinese medicine takes it back from. but there&#039;s no guarantee it&#039;s in the same form or used the same way.<br><br>also herbal medicines obviously do things, but they are generally weak and broad. although the same could be said of most drugs except they are not weak and often have severe and unknown side effects. there is also something to acupuncture and similar things but defaulting to do it for just about anything is clearly a grifty corruption of a more specific treatment.<br><br>a problematic aspect of so-called chinese traditional medicine is that promotion of it

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan.

From a theorist&#039;s perspective, the Turing model gives a canonical equivalence between the functional view of computing (i.e. lambdas, combinators, categories, etc..) and the systems view of computing (states, memory, instructions), etc.. Both can be used for theory, but the latter allows you to consolidate concrete ideas about how real computer systems work into your algorithmic theory. <br><br>The idea of a universal Turing machine is important - your computer can implement any computer, albeit slower, because there&#039;s no real distinction between a computer and a program. This is really important for understanding how to make a computer actually calculate things - and one of Turing&#039;s big contributions was both designing a stored program machine as well as giving a clear idea of the relationship between a program and its representation in memory. <br><br>Basically, in broad strokes, Turing had a lot of really interesting ideas that were later studied in greater detail (Post&#039;s work on the Turing degrees comes to mind) on the theory side, and his work was theory that illuminated a lot of important connections with the engineering vision for computers that *wasn&#039;t* obvious at the time. He has important contributions via the introduction of the Turing machine model, results in computability, some interesting connections in oscillating chemical reactions (which is funny to think about), etc..

In any case, climatologists never concluded global heating on the basis of any particular extreme weather events. It&#039;s substantiated by measurements taken over long periods of time and space, geological studies like sampling ice cores, and laboratory experimentation.", "time": 1675659490, "resto": 15178277}, {"no": 15181389, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)23:58:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181386</a><br>Fucking owned.", "time": 1675659500, "resto": 15178277}, {"no": 15181392, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:00:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181386</a><br>the various temperature proxies are even more sus than the land thermometer records", "time": 1675659640, "resto": 15178277}, {"no": 15181395, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:03:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181388</a><br>True, however destabilization of the polar vortex bringing cold air southward means warm air can flow more easily into the poles just as it\u2019s shown in the anomaly map with that big red blob over Greenland", "time": 1675659788, "resto": 15178277}, {"no": 15181398, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:04:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181392</a><br>Do you have any refutations of specific methodology of the Pages 2k study?

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative. Poor people lead an existence in perpetual captivity to their employers and hold no agency and such an existence is a lifelong experience of the hypothetical week posited.

This is stupid.<br>Not that guy, but if you buy 1000 tickets, that reduces that 15 mile high stack by 4 inches! It does not divide the probability. <br><br>1000 tickets is the width of 2 packets of 500 count copy paper, each about 2 inches, for a total of 4 inches per 1000 sheets. That makes for about 250 tickets per inch. Rounding down the odds to 250M, that would be a population of 250M unique tickets, where only one is the winner. That would be 1M inches of tickets to print them all up. Divide that by 63360 inches in a mile, that would be 15.7 miles of tickets. not 14.7 (Maybe he used thiner paper or maybe he use the real odds of closer to 300m).<br><br>Still, Buying more tickets doesn&#039;t divide the probability, it simply subtracts from the population. The number of tickets bought does not change the probability by division \u2014 if the probability of one ticket is 1 out 250M, the probability of 2 tickets is NOT 1 out of 125M.

They should more accurately be called atypical hyposerotonergics as their primary effect of downregulating serotonin sensitivity is achieved after elevating serotonin levels for some time, hence the atypical effect of not working directly.<br><br>The antidepressant effect is actually secondary and is because of an increase in BDNF that induces adult brain growth and activity that matches well with brain imaging observations, that depression is a brain state of reduced activity. Most anxiety disorders on the other hand stem from oversensitive serotonin receptors due to runaway behavioral adaptions of the neurochemistry because of excessive fearful stimuli in a modern environment.

Come up with an idea and make a startup business, or join an existing startup. Teaching yourself programming opens up a lot of opportunities, mostly full stack web development because then you can create a whole product yourself. It helps if you&#039;re confident with talking to people and just being around people in general, a lot of programmers aren&#039;t, including myself. Running a startup involves a lot of talking to people usually. But if you can create a useful product that people want to use and you get a bunch of customers and it&#039;s profitable for more than a year or two then you might be able to sell it for a few million depending on size and market etc. I&#039;ve been interested in startups for about 15 years and the hardest part is finding good people to work with. It&#039;s almost impossible. I&#039;ve asked dozens of people I&#039;ve worked with at regular jobs and friends and relatives and other people and maybe 1/40 people is interested in working on things outside of work. Most people aren&#039;t rich because they don&#039;t do anything to try to become rich. It isn&#039;t easy but it&#039;s not impossible either and most people don&#039;t even try at all ever even when everything is explained to them or someone is spoonfeeding them what to do.

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

Well, anyway, here&#039;s a direct quote from him from 2010<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me. When our Foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health. That was the main thing we did because I thought population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face. You\u2019ve got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to do that. That\u2019s the only thing that really counts. Well then I came across articles that showed that the key thing you can do to reduce population growth is actually improve health. And that sounds paradoxical. You think, \u2018OK, better health means more kids not less kids.\u2019</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWell in fact, what parents are doing is they\u2019re trying to have two kids survive to adulthood to take care of them. And so, the more disease burden that there is, the more kids they have to have to have that high probability. So there\u2019s a perfect correlation that as you improve health, within a half generation the population growth rate goes down. In fact Hans Rosling, here at this conference, in two of my favorite speeches, actually showed that unbelievable correlation that population growth has gone down. Today, where is there high population growth? It\u2019s in the places with the worst health conditions \u2013 northern Nigeria, northern India. And so the two problems go exactly hand in hand. If we improve health rapidly we will get the peak population to be as much as a billion below the current expected peak. That is about 8.3 billion versus 9.3.\u201d</span><br><br>So I guess that&#039;s how he thinks, take it as you will", "time": 1675518875, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177064, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:59:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15177056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15177056</a><br>so he want to increase health by reducing the population, and reducing the population by vaccination.<br>make sense", "time": 1675519170, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177067, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)09:08:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15176915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15176915</a><br>gates is a retard if he is such a pleb he really thinks mars is the be all, end all.
