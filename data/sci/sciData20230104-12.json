There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

The organisms that are more fit are those organisms that pass on their genes. That&#039;s it. Idiots often load the term with additional meaning, like &quot;healthier, stronger, faster, being able to outcompete&quot; but the simple mathematical reality is that &quot;fitness&quot; is merely a population-level calculus of what survives into the next generation. There is no intrinsic fitness of an organism. Not its previous evolutionary history, not its physical abilities, not its available resources. None of that. Those are mere influencers of the LIKELYHOOD of fitness, i.e. the likelihood of passing on your genes to your descendants. But fitness is fitness. If you had a population of rabbits and randomly killed half of them before they got to reproduce, the half that survives are BY DEFINITION more fit than the ones that died. it really is that simple.

Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?

Can I post my solution to confirm whether it is correct as I work through a book? I&#039;m working on problem 1a.<br>My solution:<br>Functional<br>Suppose [math] x_{1} = x_{2} \\in X [/math], then [math] x_{1}\\triangle_{X}y_{1} \\implies y_{1} = x_{1} [/math] by definition of diagonal. The same argument can be apply to [math] x_{2} [/math] to obtain the following [math] y_{2} = x_{2} [/math].<br>Since [math] x_{1} = x_{2} \\implies y_{1} = x_{1} = x_{2} = y_{2}[/math]. Thus, [math] \\triangle_{X} [/math] is functional. Similar proof can be done for [math] \\triangle_{Y} [/math]. <br><br>Mutal Inverse Mapping<br>Suppose [math]R_{1}: X \\to Y[/math] and [math]R_{2}: Y \\to X[/math] such that [math] \\triangle_{X} [/math] holds. <br>Meaning [math] \\triangle_{X} = R_{2} \\circ R_{1} = {(x,z}\\in X^{2}| z = x} = e_{x}[/math] by definition.<br>Thus, [math] \\triangle_{X} [/math] is mutally inverse mapping of X because [math] \\triangle_{X} = R_{2} \\circ R_{1} = e_{X}[/math].<br>We can apply the same argument for Y to conclude that the mutal inverse mapping of X and Y are [math]\\triangle_{X}, \\triangle_{Y} [/math].<br><br>-One question I have is, is second part is actually correct?

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.<br><br>Comments: 306 Pages.", "filename": "TIMESAND___particles==", "ext": ".png", "w": 996, "h": 339, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 42, "tim": 1672694738169450, "time": 1672694738, "md5": "cX7qa+60VLIhRJcy5tNs7Q==", "fsize": 33414, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095592, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:11", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095591</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694771055141, "time": 1672694771, "md5": "cz56Nz83qwgR/PURAssFGQ==", "fsize": 3532348, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095593, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:50", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095592</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_B.jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694810241441, "time": 1672694810, "md5": "lZ4x9Pg2IMP2l7FqKLdHQA==", "fsize": 3284973, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095595, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:29:05", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095593</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694945726281, "time": 1672694945, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095779, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:22:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where SUSY particles?", "time": 1672701741, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095860, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095779</a><br>What&#039;s SASSY particles?", "time": 1672705323, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095867, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095860</a><br>female particles. they produce many daughter particles.", "time": 1672705531, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15096327, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)00:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095557</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t really know</span><br>Yes I do.

It&#039;s frustrating, but I dunno how else to cope in life when I can&#039;t even work properly or play video games, it feels like I&#039;m just born to suffer because doctors said there&#039;s nothing they can do for me besides PT and cortisone injections which do nothing. Are there things that I can look forward to for the future or is my life &quot;done&quot;?", "filename": "1659417683143", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672739868356752, "time": 1672739868, "md5": "OzW55o3wt0F+Pk/k7gwmgw==", "fsize": 52262, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "false-hope", "replies": 17, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 15096844, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)07:34:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I miss my foreskin too.", "time": 1672749270, "resto": 15096676}, {"no": 15096846, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)07:36:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15096676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096676</a><br>It&#039;s okay.

As you try to bring your hand closer to Boulder, electromagnetic forces between the two&#039;s molecules build up. The force of gravity on both objects also creates a frictional reaction force with the ground they sit on. When you place your hand on the boulder, the force of repulsion between you and the Boulder is probably less than the force of friction holding both bodies in place on the ground. Only once one is overcome with the push the object will move. If the person&#039;s friction is over come first, they will slide back from pushing on the object. If the boulders friction is overcome first, it will slide back. If neither are, nothing will happen except slightly compressing the Molecular structure in both bodies. The reason the entire object moves when pushed is because tension forces (once again more electrostatic and Nuclear forces) keeping the object together in the shape it has, pull the parts you aren&#039;t pushing along with the rest of the object. With rigid objects like a Boulder, you won&#039;t notice it.

So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

Basically, its a bit like bingo. You can choose between 2 numbers and 10 numbers on one row. The amount of numbers you choose sets up your prize money ( 2 out of 2 gives 1 dollar and 10 out of 10 gives you 10 dollars as an example ). And I have data on the last 100 or so draws, they draw everyday so I can play everyday. I noticed however that the row price ( basically the bet you place ) only goes from 50 cents up to 100 dollars. getting 10 out of 10 has an odds of 1:2million something. But I dont need to play the big game to get a price. Simply getting 5 out of 5 on a 10 dollar bet would give me 2k. 4 out of 4 will give me 350 dollars. I already had a trial run and I got no less than atleast 2 numbers right and hit 5 numbers, but since I didnt understand the game I didnt really profit on this, but it was enough to give me a chance today. if I luck out today I can get 7 dollars for a 1 dollar bet, which would allow me to bet even more tomorrow. I can choose between playing it low-risk low-reward with a low bet but many rows ( important ) or high risk high reward with fewer rows. The importance of rows is that I need variety as it is a lottery game so nothing is guaranteed, but STILL I can make the chances go in my favour at the cost of the prize money, BUT AGAIN, if i luck out I get EVEN MORE prize money. Is there something I am not seeing or have I struck a diamond mine? They pick 20 numbers out of 1-70. if I play with 3-4 rows I am almost guaranteed a win.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

This may result from different concentrations in hormones like testosterone impacting brain development before birth. <br><br>Additionally, there is evidence that suggests some parts of the brain correlate with different genders differently. For example, female brains develop structures related to social communication associated with verbal processing earlier than male brains do.

Regardless of my suspicion that it involves fraud and not even on behalf of those who get the disability paychecks. <br>I know that psychiatric clinics are big on pushing their patients onto disability and keeping them there because this guarantuees long-term clients.

I suppose, it&#039;s nice for those who don&#039;t want to work, yet when the word got out that I had the diagnosis too, one girl told me that I should also go on disability because I was disabled. When I asked her, in what way I was disabled (ignoring the regular headaches I have), she couldn&#039;t answer the question except resorting to authority figures. &quot;A psychiatrist diagnosed this Anon, so Anon must be disabled&quot;. And I fear that most &#039;autists&#039;, especially when they&#039;re diagnosed early, have to fight against the dramatically lowered expectation that they will constantly face. If you want to spend the rest of your life like Chris Chandler, you can probably work with it.

I mean ARE you?<br>The answer is no. You are moving through time. Everyone at every instant has some velocity through time. In fact, this &quot;velocity&quot; is actually through spacetime ( a vector [t, x, y, z] ). We call this your &quot;4-velocity&quot; to signify we are in space-time, not just space.<br>In this scenario, you are moving through spacetime with 4-velocity: [c, 0, 0, 0] where c is some constant speed (or what we call the speed of light in our universe).<br>If you begin to move in a physical direction, let&#039;s say the x-axis, you&#039;re actually rotating your 4-velocity into that axis. For example, something may move through space with 4-velocity: [0, c, 0, 0]. Notice how by moving through space, you must alter how you move through time. Also notice, since we are merely rotating velocities, we can never have a 4-velocity such as [c, c, 0, 0].<br><br>In the case of gravity, we view the curvature of spacetime as a motion. In other words, the curvature is defined in the time axis. An intuitive interpretation of this for me is that you can imagine space as some invisible medium like air which flows (with wind) towards a center of gravity. There is no difference between space itself flowing past you, and you moving through space. In both scenarios you are moving with respect to space, or in other words space always flows past you from your perspective. If you stand at a constant distance from a gravitational object, space will flow past you at a constant rate, similar to if you were moving through space at a constant rate, far away from any object.<br><br>Therefore in both cases, you have rotated some of your velocity out of the time axis by some factor. In physics this is called the Lorentz factor.<br><br>It should be noted that if it wasn&#039;t for the planet holding you up, you would flow WITH this flowing spacetime and &quot;fall&quot;.", "time": 1672775293, "resto": 15096886}, {"no": 15097947, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)16:07:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15097721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15097721</a><br>its crazy for me to think about it like that because it seems so far removed from how we actually experience reality", "time": 1672780046, "resto": 15096886}, {"no": 15098237, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:55:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15097721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15097721</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what you feel as &quot;gravity&quot;</span><br>You don&#039;t feel gravity.

I\u2019m just replying to OPs shitty thread with my own examples.<br>And anyway, unless you die as a direct result of vaccine administration (i.e. complications arising because of the short-term jab side effects), no respectable clinician or medical examiner will point to a vaccine as the cause of any death.

It took 3 years for scientists to discover that HIV caused AIDS\u2014before that, nobody knew quite why people were dying of AIDS. It will take longer for COVID vaccines to be recognized as a long-term cause of death, since vaccines are way more elusive. And that\u2019s IF they even do cause long-term complications, and IF the research is ever sincerely done.
