Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as &quot;algebraic objects&quot;. It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject. Another important aspect of the introduction of algebraic ideas was that it allowed mathematics to be applied to itself in a way which had not happened before.</span><br><br>The fact he wrote these

Firstly, it would not just affect objects that have passed through the portal, but would also effect objects on the other side. So, anything placed in front of the blue portal would be pushed away by this moving space. But, how far does this go. Does the portal push a column of space outwards towards infinity? Say instead of a cube you put a 10 mile rod through the portal? Does the spacial distortion travel the 10 miles of rod.

I dropped out of college due to personal issues when I was younger. I was enrolled in an undergrad computer science program. I was and still am genuinely interested in tcs, in fact even after dropping out I would still spend lots of time programming, and working through various textbooks. For example I worked through most of Rosen&#039;s book on Discrete math, the first couple of chapters from SICP, and a handful of others. I&#039;ve been working in restaurants, retail, customer service/etc. I wanted to move into a field of work that I&#039;d find more rewarding and interesting, but I had no success getting my foot in the door. <br><br>Very recently I enrolled in a computer science program at WGU, the appeal for me is that it&#039;s fully online and you can test out of courses whenever you want, allowing to finish way quicker and cheaper. Also my living circumstances are somewhat unstable, so being online seemed like a huge benefit for me.<br><br>What concerns me is that the courses are really lackluster. The ones i&#039;ve done so far were extremely watered down, to the point of being nearly useless.

I&#039;m European and before university mathematics was my favourite subject and I went through the hardest mathematics grammar schools. It was my favourite because it was the only subject not dependent on rote anything, be it memory drill, or whatever. In this subject you could arrive at answers in tests through pure reasoning and not some rote piece of information you had to remember, such as was the case in history or biology. But as time went on and I met actual mathematicians and went to a pure maths program, it all quite ensoured me. In my early teenage years I&#039;ve not had particularly well developed critical thinking abilities. This meant I gave into the superstition of MBTI and through it I met MBTI communities. After realizing the nonsense it was, I returned to them and in there was a PhD graduate of pure mathematics. This person struggled to understand consistent human behavior across time is inherited through genetics, which are made up of a series of additive alleles, and how that entails the distribution of human behavior is gaussian, hence no binary dichotomy model such as MBTI could be valid. I tried to help him understand by explaining how that&#039;s exactly the same case as coin flips, hence the binomial, but he just wouldn&#039;t get it, and kept using ad hominem argumentation, without ever losing faith in his pseudoscience. And in regards of the pure maths program, there was nearly no reasoning. We&#039;ve had to remember 20 pages of definitions for god knows what reason from god knows where, essentially training us to be little bitchy parrots. When discussing having found a quicker solution, the TA agreed with my chain of reasoning, but said I should stick to the definition instead, with everyone glorifying drilling solving problems the way professor has done on the board over and over again, which made me remember this weaving-basket forum post of a humanities major trying mathematics and realizing it&#039;s all just a bunch", "filename": "image_2023-02-07_194919940", "ext": ".png", "w": 470, "h": 286, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1675795788451511, "time": 1675795788, "md5": "hCXeqcD5Btjt6x0knIbDCQ==", "fsize": 141142, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-having-a-crisis-of-faith-in-mathematics-im", "replies": 70, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 15184766, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)13:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15184765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15184765</a><br>of \u201cautists solving puzzles\u201d. As a child I briefly programmed in C, but in spite of being victorious in regional competitions, I quickly realized the people best at programming just keep programming all the time, and the tasks we were supposed to do in programming lessons or when I remembered programming were just so tedious and mundane. When I moved from C to Unity, I realized it was about remembering all the commands from all the various imported libraries, which I realized only several months of a quite fun time trying to figure out how to implement a region-triggered event. As such I decided never to touch programming again. But then seeing analysis in pure mathematics, that\u2019s exactly how it felt like. And it\u2019s even worse, because these people aren\u2019t gleaning anything interesting from what they\u2019re doing beyond a boundary, meaning they can\u2019t even put a definite finger on anything. I\u2019d rather have a statistician bullshit me than an analysis mathematician. I&#039;d always thought mathematics was the peak of human reasoning, but with all of what I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019m finding it hard to believe. Even looking at the structure of crystallized reasoning and the most complex jobs, writing ability, particularly as a form of composing written arguments, rises far above mathematics. I also know /sci/ to be a particularly dumb board. I wanted to do mathematics, because it was the only form of knowledge which wasn\u2019t an empirical form of unintelligent parroting.

Contra Kant, but following Schopenhauer, Bertrand Russell, Grover Maxwell, Michael Lockwood, Galen Strawson, et al., the new idealists conjecture that the phenomenology of one&#039;s mind reveals the intrinsic nature of the physical \u2013 the elusive &quot;fire&quot; in the equations about which physics is silent. Mathematical physics yields an exhaustive description of the relational-structural properties of the world. This description may ultimately be encoded by the universal wavefunction of post-Everetta quantum mechanics: our best mathematical description of reality. However, our presupposition that the intrinsic character of the physical lacks phenomenal properties is an additional metaphysical assumption. The assumption is hugely plausible, but it&#039;s not a scientific discovery. Perhaps most tellingly, the only part of the &quot;fire&quot; in the equations to which one ever enjoys direct access, i.e. one&#039;s own consciousness, discloses phenomenal properties that are inconsistent with a materialist ontology. For reasons unexplained, the natural world contains first-person facts. The world supports at least one non-zombie. And natural science gives no reason to believe that one is special.</span>", "time": 1676030867, "resto": 15184700}, {"no": 15191901, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:10:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15191881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15191881</a><br>Not that guy, but under an idealist conception of the universe, everything is ultimately an idea.<br>Depending on whether you are an objective idealist or a subjective idealist, you might either believe that:<br>a) ideas are real independently of whether there are any phenomena that correspond to them, meaning that not all phenomena might necessarily be real at all, but also that there can be a substratum of ideas going beyond known phenomena<br>b) nothing is real except for that which can be thought of, and there is no true distinction between imagination and reality, since both are part of the realm of ideas<br><br>Objective idealism offers us no criteria by which we can distinguish real phenomena from fake ones, nor does it suggest that we might be able to tell whether a certain conception is the true, since there is nothing we can compare that conception to in the lack of a criterion that would determine its falsehood.<br>Subjective idealism does away with all notions of reality and falsehood, but remains stuck in the possibility that there might not necessarily be anything consistent out there.<br>Intersubjective idealism would require using the existence of others as an axiom, as well as a belief that there is a sharing of thoughts by a certain means.

In fact, consciousness wasn&#039;t even a seriously addressed subject until at least the days of Kant, but the kind of idealism that Immanuel Kant asserted was not one about the ultimate constitution of reality, but rather about a mental framework that all humans are born with and have immediate access to that is used to judge experienced phenomena. Since metaphysical speculation was shut down by Kant&#039;s first Critique, there were no attempts to raise &quot;ideas&quot; into the status of ultimately real stuff the way the Platonists did. Hegel&#039;s entire phenomenological project was based on understanding consciousness by the means of understanding ideas, which is to say, analyzing what is knowable in a logical manner, independently of any claims of the ultimately real. Experiencing is separate from judging, just as judging is separate from reasoning. Although we may claim that conscious experience is undeniably real, we cannot assert that experience itself is truly representative of everything independently of experience. Furthermore, asserting that reality is of the same stuff as experience would lower everything else that exists to a weak, flimsy state that has no fixed forms and that would be tinged by the presence of consciousnesses.<br>The idealism you claim is closer to George Berkeley&#039;s subjective idealism (which was strongly mocked in the 18th century and still is) than to the great Platonic idealism, which puts true ideas on a status higher that of mere thinking and what you call &quot;conscious experience&quot;.<br>This idealism that you allegedly defend does not allow for there to be something stronger than conscious experience.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

Only confusing thing is why &quot;A Transition to Advanced Mathematics&quot; isn&#039;t grouped together with Hammack and Velleman. It&#039;s literally another intro to proofs book (and definitely not more advanced than the other two), they&#039;re all kinda interchangeable.<br>I will say that Velleman should be the highlighted one in a graphic that&#039;s supposed to be &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot;. Velleman is by far the closest to being an informal introduction to logic and set theory (no surprise there since he did his phd under Kunen, so naturally his presentation will be quite foundationpilled).<br><br>The set theory books would be kinda out of place here, but since it&#039;s &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot; I&#039;ll give it a pass. And they&#039;re both very elementary and well written so good choices, but possibly questionable placement in the chart, especially if one is just coming from a book like Velleman which honestly already covers most of the important content in either set theory book, just in an informal manner.

It&#039;s the best one price/quality-wise, because the money that doesn&#039;t get spent in a flimsy mount, actually goes to the telescope itself. Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

As such, the therapeutic effect on ADHD would not be subject to tolerance \u2014 apparently the biological mechanism at play here makes it \u201cimpossible to plug more sites than are already there.\u201d<br><br>The reason that most believe they are experiencing tolerance is because tolerance to the non-therapeutic effects (many of these are \u201cpositive\u201d) of stimulants is absolutely subject to a very steep tolerance curve. Non-therapeutic effects include but are not limited to: increased energy, mitigation of depressive symptoms and other \u201cpositive\u201d things. What is likely occurring is that most patients see the fading of (for example) the lift out of depression as \u201ctolerance,\u201d when really that is to be expected.&#039;&#039;<br><br>In short, it works, but in silence.

Discovered in 2002 and about 697 miles wide (1,121 kilometers), Quaoar is one of the so-called trans-Neptunian objects, small planets orbiting beyond the solar system&#039;s outermost planet Neptune. Residing in the Kuiper Belt, the doughnut-shaped ring of rocky and icy debris in the outer solar system, Quaoar is a proud owner of its own moon, the 100-mile-wide (160 km) Weywot. And a recent observation campaign revealed that it also has a ring of material in its orbit. [...]<br><br>Quaoar&#039;s ring is at a very unusual distance from its parent body. In fact, before astronomers discovered Quaoar&#039;s ring in observations from several telescopes conducted between 2018 and 2021, they had thought that it was impossible for a ring to exist at such a distance. With a radius of about 2,420 miles (3,885 km) from Quaoar&#039;s center, the ring is too far away from the dwarf planet that its gravity should no longer be able to keep the material dispersed. Instead, it should coalesce under its own gravity and form another moon, just like Weywot. By not having done that, the ring has breached what astronomers call the Roche limit, the first known ring around a celestial body to have done so. [...] Now astronomers have to either rethink the Roche limit or come up with another explanation for the existence of Quaoar&#039;s ring.", "filename": "1675868089025301", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 608, "h": 1074, "tn_w": 141, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676061002845492, "time": 1676061002, "md5": "wTnYTQANuHYZTlgDzGOlOQ==", "fsize": 423583, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mystery-ring-around-the-planet", "replies": 5, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 15192775, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:20:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15192622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15192622</a><br>Dem rangs.<br><br>Very strange, there must be something strange going on with the gravity of that dwarf planet.", "time": 1676064057, "resto": 15192622}, {"no": 15192785, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:25:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;popsci.com</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;roastie.png</span>", "filename": "reddit soyence", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 621, "h": 542, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 109, "tim": 1676064300862490, "time": 1676064300, "md5": "JxqoPr4zgWKT4JMfvrwvaA==", "fsize": 88350, "resto": 15192622}, {"no": 15192787, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:25:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Astrum did a video on the DART mission.

hypothetically violate the second law of thermodynamics. It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In his first letter Maxwell called the demon a &quot;finite being&quot;, while the Daemon name was first used by Lord Kelvin.<br><br>In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small massless door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon&#039;s actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the system, without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.<br><br>The concept of Maxwell&#039;s demon has provoked substantial debate in the philosophy of science and theoretical physics, which continues to the present day. It stimulated work on the relationship between thermodynamics and information theory. Most scientists argue, on theoretical grounds, that no practical device can violate the second law in this way.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

Because complex numbers fill up a plane, and specific numbers are analogous to various rotations, they encode rotation information numerically.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

The physical world is virtual. It was booted up with an influx of information which also booted up the time (cycles) and space (pixels) of the reality. Some of the players immersed in the reality want the virtual reality to be self existent in and of itself. At some point it became apparent that the reality began. This is an uncomfortable fact if you have a presupposition that the universe is all that there is, being that the universe could not have initiated itself, as this would mean it would have had to exist before it&#039;s beginning.

Alden Mead published a paper in which he determined the effect of gravity on a phenomenon called diffraction, which describes what happens to light when you send it through a small aperture. Because gravity is so incredibly weak compared to the force that governs the behavior of light (the electromagnetic force), its effect is completely ignored in diffraction calculations. But Mead was curious about quantifying gravity&#039;s negligible effect. When you scatter a particle of light off another particle \u2014 say an atom \u2014 the atom&#039;s gravitational attraction to the light particle causes an intrinsic uncertainty in the atom&#039;s location. Mead used the uncertainty principle and the gravitational effect of the photon to show that it is impossible to determine the position of an object to a precision smaller than the Planck length.</span><br><br>you can&#039;t get any preciser than the Planck length. it doesn&#039;t mean that the universe is composed of planck-length voxels", "time": 1676022187, "resto": 15187301}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15187235, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:22:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;higgs boson</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gravity waves</span><br>both discovered in the 2010s. what can we expect to discover in the 2020s?", "filename": "1656904791607", "ext": ".png", "w": 685, "h": 568, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 207, "tim": 1675880534471364, "time": 1675880534, "md5": "TDEui4YJ9vylsA09FW6LqQ==", "fsize": 192196, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "higgs-boson", "replies": 21, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 15187347, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:24:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187235</a><br>nothing because the LHC has been nothing but a useless money sink looking for a reason to exist after the Higgs boson", "time": 1675884290, "resto": 15187235}, {"no": 15187348, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:25:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187347</a><br>FPBP", "time": 1675884308, "resto": 15187235}, {"no": 15187354, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:28:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i&#039;m hoping for more fusion power breakthroughs<br><br>i just don&#039;t get why we&#039;re building the international test reactor to be so huge<br>wouldn&#039;t it be much easier to build a smaller version and then go big once you crack the code?", "time": 1675884537, "resto": 15187235}, {"no": 15187357, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187235</a><br>I&#039;m working on a new law of attraction.
