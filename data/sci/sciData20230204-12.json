The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book.

Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients. This is because patients with undetected infections would be unlikely to be reinfected when testing availability expanded later during our study period. Second, our measure of COVID-19 ending in death within 30-days could also be inaccurate because we did not have access to death certificate data to confirm the actual cause of death. However, many deaths immediately following COVID-19 infection are likely to be at least partially related.<br><br>The availability of vitamin D3 without a prescription also limits our ability to ensure we have fully categorized dosage and supplementation intensity.&quot;<br><br>they bent data, made assumptions and didn&#039;t actually find any significant difference.", "time": 1675236284, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>I looked in the astroturfed zinc and quercitin recommendation to prevent covid.<br>It is all the same.<br>Does nothing and is potentially toxic.", "time": 1675271931, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169874, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>Thoughts on taking 10,000 IU vitamin D daily?

Even if you don&#039;t understand the limitations of machine learning technology which is essentially matrix multiplication with some nonlinear functions seated in between, you should at least know that the reason why programming languages exist in the way they are is because of their flexibility in ability to do specific tasks. That&#039;s the reason why programmers don&#039;t code in natural language.<br>After a long time AI may eventually be able to write large and complicated software from a mere natural language prompt, but it won&#039;t ever be specifically what you want. and adjusting to those specificities is the reason why there are so many software jobs.

And nowadays even if you look at the most dull and code-monkey sector of the software development, the frontend industry, it still holds a huge amount of jobs available despite being a shitton simplified..<br>So being worried about that is the same as being worried that mathematicians would be replaced by calculators.

They can learn, they can remember, its even been demonstrated that they are capable of low level abstract reasoning and forms of elementary language. But if you took the very smartest of those animals and tried to reach them anything more complex than simple tricks or to solve simple puzzles you would fail. Simply because they lack the cognitive ability, the reasoning power, the ability to form complex concepts. Lets say you even taught some Gorillas complex language, so well that they could fully communicate with us. Then asked them to formulate a theory of clouds. They lack the technology to even investigate what a cloud is let alone the conceptual framework to explain it in terms of molecules of water. Well, the same applies to Humans when it comes to trying to understand the Universe. Its simply beyond our reasoning powers.

If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative.

This is stupid.<br>Not that guy, but if you buy 1000 tickets, that reduces that 15 mile high stack by 4 inches!

That makes for about 250 tickets per inch. Rounding down the odds to 250M, that would be a population of 250M unique tickets, where only one is the winner. That would be 1M inches of tickets to print them all up. Divide that by 63360 inches in a mile, that would be 15.7 miles of tickets. not 14.7 (Maybe he used thiner paper or maybe he use the real odds of closer to 300m).<br><br>Still, Buying more tickets doesn&#039;t divide the probability, it simply subtracts from the population.

It uses a trick invented by old-timey clock makers called Asymmetrical Weights. Essentially, you have two gears connected by a circular chain (like the chain in a bicycle), one gear is held high and the other one is near the ground, and then you hang a weight from the chain. This causes the gears to rotate with a force equal to the weight. Connect the gears to a set of differential gears to multiply rotational speed, and then connect that to a generator to produce electricity.<br><br>Eventually, the weight will reach the ground and the generator will need to be rewound by lifting the weight back up. But this is much easier and much more effortless than it sounds. All you have to do is divide the weight into manageable sizes (e.g., use ten 1-kilogram weights instead of a single 10-kilogram weight) and/or use pulley systems or differential gears to lift it.<br><br>So long as you rewind the generator by hand, you can get as much electricity as you want to for free.", "filename": "ASYMM2", "ext": ".png", "w": 423, "h": 500, "tn_w": 211, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675441469991833, "time": 1675441469, "md5": "13YbfqBmyapRhdlA05G6Kw==", "fsize": 27200, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-build-a-gravitybased-generator-to-get-free", "replies": 6, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 15174972, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cool story.", "time": 1675442089, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15174994, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:46:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a>", "filename": "low", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 323, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1675442772183673, "time": 1675442772, "md5": "E4RquZ9/td9Xc+5tHKi8fA==", "fsize": 19788, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15175047, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)12:13:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a><br>gravity battery", "time": 1675444398, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15175168, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:09:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a><br>So it&#039;s just a hand crank generator?

This could reveal their rivals\u2019 surveillance and weapons systems or help intercept communications.</span><br>https://arstechnica.com/science/202<wbr>3/02/enter-the-hunter-satellites-pr<wbr>eparing-for-space-war/<br><br>commercial spy sats now? wtf", "time": 1675390004, "resto": 15173472}, {"no": 15173613, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:08:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15173472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15173472</a><br>me when I jerk my dick, hahaha.", "time": 1675390087, "resto": 15173472}, {"no": 15173614, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)21:08:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15173538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15173538</a><br>There\u2019s nothing stopping europe from developing an RD-275ish type hypergolic engine with 1,500 kN of thrust.

Come up with an idea and make a startup business, or join an existing startup. Teaching yourself programming opens up a lot of opportunities, mostly full stack web development because then you can create a whole product yourself. It helps if you&#039;re confident with talking to people and just being around people in general, a lot of programmers aren&#039;t, including myself. Running a startup involves a lot of talking to people usually. But if you can create a useful product that people want to use and you get a bunch of customers and it&#039;s profitable for more than a year or two then you might be able to sell it for a few million depending on size and market etc. I&#039;ve been interested in startups for about 15 years and the hardest part is finding good people to work with. It&#039;s almost impossible. I&#039;ve asked dozens of people I&#039;ve worked with at regular jobs and friends and relatives and other people and maybe 1/40 people is interested in working on things outside of work. Most people aren&#039;t rich because they don&#039;t do anything to try to become rich. It isn&#039;t easy but it&#039;s not impossible either and most people don&#039;t even try at all ever even when everything is explained to them or someone is spoonfeeding them what to do.

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675463928243218, "time": 1675463928, "md5": "cz56Nz83qwgR/PURAssFGQ==", "fsize": 3532348, "resto": 15175508}, {"no": 15175744, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:39:24", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15175742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175742</a><br>http://gg762.net/d0cs/papers/Sixty-<wbr>Six_Theses__v2-20220726.pdf", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_B.jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675463964643957, "time": 1675463964, "md5": "lZ4x9Pg2IMP2l7FqKLdHQA==", "fsize": 3284973, "resto": 15175508}, {"no": 15175755, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:51:59", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15175744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175744</a><br><a href=\"#p15175744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175744</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675464719783243, "time": 1675464719, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 15175508}, {"no": 15175756, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:52:41", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15175744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175744</a><br><a href=\"#p15175755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175755</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___Accolades_due", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3232, "h": 2216, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1675464761848855, "time": 1675464761, "md5": "9MSGD88iAWoebsEPxII8vQ==", "fsize": 1250766, "resto": 15175508}, {"no": 15175761, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:54:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15175742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15175742</a><br>This crap again.

That is, they get old and become infirm, which allows a predator or disease or something else to kill them. <br>Remember that life extension/longevity/age reversal (or stagnation) are all one-in-the-same, effectively.

Given people are born every day with missing limbs or horrific genetic diseases, I refuse to believe that not one had mutations like increased anti-oxidant production.

However, most species actually don&#039;t really compete directly with another species. If they do, they usually compete on the fringes rather than performing the exact same niche. <br>Rather than being a continuous, gradual process, evolution is a &quot;punctuated equilibrium.&quot; Selection pressures, and their respective intensities, change over time. During periods of high intensity selective pressure (e.g. during the mass extinction following the dino die off), evolution occurs extremely rapidly. During periods of minimal intensity, evolution occurs more slowly.<br>During periods of high selective pressure, pressures from external sources, such as whether there is enough food, become supreme. During low pressure periods, selective pressures from other sources, such as mating selection, become more prominent. Thus, these low selective periods see a great deal of intraspecies competition and selection.

It also appears that the basis of aging and mutations (which lead to adaptations, ofc) is one-in-the-same. Both seem to be, at least partially, rooted in DNA damage. <br>Therefore, longevity might also literally prevent a species from mutating as quickly and therefore inhibit its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing circumstance.

The key observation is that if you have a bit that sticks out horizontally, you can get rid of it by extending the bit it&#039;s sticking out of vertically by the same amount, without changing the perimeter. So you divide the shape into two parts like in picrel, then you calculate the perimeter of the part on the left: you take the bits that stick out by 3, 2, 3 units, get rid of them, extend the &quot;column&quot; they&#039;re attached to by (3+2+3)=8 units, leaving you with a vertically flipped L with a height of 16 units and a top edge of 4. That&#039;s a parimeter of (16+4)*2=40. Now you have the part on the right. If you ignore the hole on the bottom and treat it like another L shape, you get a parimeter of (4+7)*2=22. Suppose the height of that hole on the bottom is x; then the calculation is short by 2x. However, treating the two parts as separate and adding their perimeters overshoots the real perimeter by adding the length of that shared bit twice, i.e. it overshoots by 2x, so it cancels out. 40+22=62, or in other words: (8+4+3+2+3+4+7)*2=62.

This is, ultimately, dictated by the rate of the expansion of the Universe which determines the overall velocity at which everything in the Universe is moving. The higher the absolute velocity of all things, the higher light&#039;s speed. The more rapidly electrical energy is dissipated in the reverse temporal dimension.

One person kind of presented an argument, he said no present moment exists because the theory of relativity says one person&#039;s present is another person&#039;s past etc. I presented the counterargument that nobody is ever actually watching the past, for example when you&#039;re watching a star and the light took years to travel to your eyes you&#039;re not watching the star in the past, you&#039;re watching the light which is currently at your eyes.

Yes, he had an interest in science and philosophy, since that was typical of Renaissance humanists like Da Vinci, but he wasn&#039;t really at the forefront of these fields. Like I said in my previous post, even within the context of Renaissance Italian mathematics and science he wasn&#039;t at the top. For example, Tartaglia and Cardano were both mathematicians of the time period who have had a much greater impact on the development of math and science. However, the most relevant example is probably Luca Pacioli (pic related). He was a very famous mathematician and scientist, and he actually worked with Da Vinci. They wrote scientific books together. Luca Pacioli handled the science and math and Da Vinci handled the illustrations. That&#039;s because Luca Pacioli was more of a scientist and Da Vinci was more of an artist. <br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;15171738</span><br>Flying machines and tanks are inventions not discoveries, i.e. they fall in the domain of engineering, not science. It&#039;s very common amongst normies and the pop sci community to conflate science and engineering, but they&#039;re different fields with different cultures and different skill sets. Also, Da Vinci didn&#039;t actually invent those things, all he did was create drawings, and they generally didn&#039;t involve a lot of mathematical or mechanical detail. <br><br>As for human anatomy, he may have made some minor contribution, but that doesn&#039;t make him one of the greatest scientists of all time.

In a new study, a research team including Ms. Grzadzinski and Dr. Lord described the characteristics of youth who are most likely to experience the fever effect. The team examined data from 2,152 children with autism who participated in the Simons Simplex Collection research project. Parents of 362 children, or 17 percent, reported that their sons or daughters had experienced the fever effect.
