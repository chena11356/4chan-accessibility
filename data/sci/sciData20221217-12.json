We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals.

We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul.

I assume this rank is reserved for the descendants of David, or something like that, which genetically excludes the people that run DB from ever taking control of the Knights of Malta. Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today.

Gravity depends on not just one piece of space pulling, but the information of that pull being transferred to each vector of time-space around the gravitational object. Each vector or particle does not care about how much gravity strength is being reported from one single vector, but from each and all at once. So the mass of the singularity is thus imaginary.

Because its amount of mass is ultimately less than the total amount of mass of the universe, its pull is relative exactly as a fraction of this. Infinite gravity or not, the vectors do not care about the reported gravity, only the amount of vectors reporting this.

A Maid Card is going to consist of a Maid Sticker and a drawing of a Maid Space.<br><br>The Maid Sticker is just supposed to be easily human readable/identifiable so you can tell which card you are using quickly. I got the idea from stickers on Super Nintendo games. Attached is an example. It is the Maid Sticker for Kurumi MaidCard.<br><br>The Maid Space itself holds the information because all the information there is, is just a number and Maid Space can count to any number except God.<br><br>I will put an example showing this in my next post.<br><br>I put the KJV Bible in a Maid Space. The conversion worked, but the problem is the PNG of the Maid Space (without even adding the Maid Sticker) is 8MB.<br><br>This isn&#039;t a huge problem, because 8MB isn&#039;t massive, but it is too big to post on 4Chan, without even adding the Bible&#039;s Maid Sticker.

Genuinely the smartest person I&#039;ve ever met, he was the &#039;crazy&#039; type of smart. He wrote a paper in the 70s while he was a graduate student that expanded on early Gauge Theory. His advisors and all the other academics refused to accept his results. 40 years later, he finally got recognition for his accomplishments because two ivy-league professors published the same results he had done 4 decades earlier. His work is now taught at Princeton and in several textbooks. His name is Kuo\u2010Ho (Tom) Yang, I always found it weird when people from Asia take an American name but I guess I understand, it would get annoying fast to have mid-westerners constantly fucking up your name. There isn&#039;t a picture of him anywhere on the internet. He was the greatest teacher I&#039;ve ever had. After class and labs, he would just sit and talk to you for hours about anything if you wanted. Always enthusiastic about the topic being discussed. He would tell you stories from his life, like how as a kid, he used to dig through the Taiwanese military&#039;s trash to find thrown away radios and other tech to salvage components for circuits he was making. I found his landmark paper a while back, but can&#039;t seem to find it atm cause Google is shit now, here are some of his published works: https://aip.scitation.org/topic/aip<wbr>thesaurus/p3437p87479?pageSize=100&amp;<wbr>startPage=&amp;ContribAuthorRaw=Hirschf<wbr>elder%2C%20Joseph%20O <br>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/1<wbr>0.1063/1.442295<br>He has a bunch more, that is just through that one publication. I doubt 99% of students get the chance to have a teacher like him, I am lucky. It was like having one of the top Ivy-league professors teach your freshman dynamics 2 course in a class of 17 people.

Maybe /sci/ will be slightly more focused on the technical question to not kneejerk. Crickets don&#039;t even need light; you can battery farm them in a way that makes chicken farms look like luxury resorts and they&#039;ll do just fine so long as they don&#039;t freeze. I&#039;m working out the details of a design that will produce 3000 kcals/day in perpetuity by just supplying spirulina from roof panels and water (the one thing I need to source in bulk) to ~60 growing pods (one cricket life cycle is about two months) with attached dirt pads for the females to lay eggs in before I harvest that pod for the next cycle each day. A little insect animal brutality (lmao) means the whole thing could fit in the smallest model garden sheds available at home improvement stores to stay nondescript and protect from the elements. Tack some insulation to the inside for sound damping and throw in a tiny fuel radiator for heating and it&#039;s ready to crank out the flour in a fraction of a percent of the space it takes to make actual flour.<br><br>And if I about triple the size, it can feed my chickens instead so I don&#039;t have to eat the bug at all. I think this really is the way to go for people without the spare million dollars or so lying around to buy and tend a subsistence farm and who don&#039;t want to waste time on pinterest memes. Just turn sunlight into spirulina, spirulina into crickets, and crickets into chickens and eggs. You can then use the cricket frass to grow potato boxes or whatever else doesn&#039;t work at scale for some spice in your diet. Works either if you live in a middle-class detached house on your own or if you find a lower-class smaller-scale multiplex or apartment complex with neighbors who will help in exchange for food.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

Indeed, deductive mathematics was born in ancient Greece. There is no evidence of anyone having produced a deductive mathematical proof before the Greeks. And there is no evidence that anyone after the Greeks independently developed deductive mathematics; all the peoples who knew about deductive mathematics had acquired that knowledge by coming into contact with Greek mathematics (like the Iranians and the Arabs). China, India, Japan, and other remote countries never developed an indigenous deductive system of mathematics. Their mathematics was merely heuristic with no notion of logical demonstration.

This was not the case until very recently. For the time of Descartes and Newton all the way to the days of Russell, Hilbert, and Brouwer, debate was always welcomed as a normal part of science. Sharp criticism of other people&#039;s work is much more frowned upon today. Partially because research is more insular, so you&#039;re not really supposed to criticize another scholars work if he&#039;s one of the only experts on the topic in question, and partially because retraction and revision of prior results has become taboo.

We&#039;re not at the &quot;what type of fusion rocket&quot; phase yet. The point is that some kind of fusion rocket is what is going to enable fast interplanetary, and slow but possible interstellar travel. It&#039;s worthwhile to build fusion rockets simply because they are the obvious next step as the learning rate of chemical rockets begins to slow. Chemical rockets are much better for all commercial applications for the foreseeable future. Excellent, this was the point of funding chemical rocket research in the first place. It&#039;s time to do the same thing for fusion. And no, it isn&#039;t too early, you absolute faggots. Goddard spent his life being ridiculed by people who thought rockets were a waste of money and time. He never lived to see an orbital launch. Should he have just waited and done nothing until people came around and declared that it was time to build rockets because they were commerically viable? Of course not.

You didn&#039;t answer the question. I would like evidence that links specific brain cells to the creation of a specific thought or concept in a way that can be repeatedly demonstrated and for added bonus point, show how a completely different set of brain cells in two different people&#039;s heads can produce the same concept in two different minds to where we can know what one another are talking about, namely infinity in this case. Or, cut to the chase and tell me how a piece of objectively observable meat beams a non-objectively observable subjective experience into an observer. And explain why consciousness, if it is a physical object, can not be objectively observed as all other physical objects can be? What is the mechanism whereby this piece of meat actually transmits this non-material concept of infinity or any other concept to the experiencer?<br>point being pic related. Consciousness is not physical. Consciousness is made of consciousness, not brain or matter. Consciousness IS, because of a high level of immersion in the physical (virtual) world, constrained in certain ways by physicality that that can be observed and experienced neural correlatively, but that shouldn&#039;t be mistaken for consciousness being made of matter or it being a physical substance. So the number of cells in a physical (virtual) brain is irrelevant to what a mind can conceive of. In point of fact, brains, as is all other matter, are only ever observed as MENTAL OBJECTS in minds. And this by the way is why infinities are grounded in minds, not in the physical world. No infinities in the physical world, no continuities, no analyticity.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

Moreover, the 19th century dream of defining physical things by their smallest parts is blown up according to formalism. If fields are essential, than the parts can only be analyzed as part of the whole. The ramifications of this have been slow to move through the sciences. Most people still have a conception of reality very close to 19th century materialism.<br><br>So, complimentary can be resolved if you define a thing by what it does, but then it appears you are saying things &quot;are math,&quot; which not everyone likes.<br><br>As noted above, formalism can lead back into Platonism as mathematical objects are defined as systems, although the role of axioms here is a hard barrier to cross for those hoping to avoid the seeming relativity of formalism.<br><br>The other big school is the attempt to reduce math to logic. This was huge in the early 20th century but seemed to fail. Lately though, it is back with advances in math.<br><br>There is also a attempt to unify math and physics under objective logic, the proof text of which is still the Science of Logic. People now generally accept that Russel and Co&#039;s attack on SoL doesn&#039;t maintain and that they didn&#039;t understand it, but SoL still suffers from being written before huge advances in logic and science and has to be reformulated.
