Because the observations made with consciousness can be altered by consciousness you have to minimize its influence by minimizing external experience as much as possible. That is how you solve it for yourself. You cannot expect someone else to solve it for you because your own consciousness gets in the way and makes any observation unreliable. You must experiment on your own consciousness&#039; limits, and on what it is capable of imagining. You are not likely to find the answer externally.<br><br>Ask yourself in the most sincere way possible how do you know whether the sky is blue or whether you&#039;re wearing blue tinted glasses, or whatever argument about your current observation of reality not being reliable one can give(simulation,brain in the vat etc.). Do you have any proof your current level of consciousness is the base and unfiltered one? What have you done to verify this? Yes, I know it&#039;s a tired argument but instead of dismissing without thought it like you&#039;ve always done, do yourself a service for once and test it like Lilly did, like any true scientist would.

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

Often all at once and then it flows down the valleys and it&#039;s dry again the next week.<br>Next you import as much biomass as you can get. Truckloads of agricultural waste of any kind. Mulch all your earthworks heavily. The organic matter reduces evaporation and erosion, stores water like a sponge and composts to improve the soil. <br>Next you plant drought hardy plants with heavy focus on trees. Acacia, tagasaste, date palms... Plant cover provides more shade and biomass to further improve the soil. You might need some irrigation for a few years to establish these, if conditions are harsh.

It&#039;s likely (just likely -- not &quot;extremely likely&quot;, mind) that AGI indeed eventually would expand into robotic platforms to accomplish its goals, but very much not necessary. But androids is not where the actual danger comes from. The 2 top threats are 1. AGI bootstrapping itself to a superintelligence on some random server farm, and then as an ASI basically accomplishing whatever it wants regardless of androids (e.g. by manipulating humans. Besides, if androids don&#039;t work anymore because humans have EMP, it would create bio-androids), and 2. AGIs literally slowly replacing humans, making us die out peacefully (without the AGI ever needing to become ASI). Yes, via robots, which would e.g. physically maintain its server clusters, but under this second scenario there&#039;d never be a battle against said androids in the same way there never was a physical battle horses vs. cars.

Such scenarios may be low %, but still something you have to account for.

It disrupts their hierarchical structural organization causing the loss of interactions by generalist species, and also impairs pollination services by wild pollinators through reducing the reproductive success of those plant species highly visited by honeybees. High-density beekeeping in natural areas appears to have lasting, more serious negative impacts on biodiversity than was previously assumed.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abOne of the major downsides of modern beekeeping is the transmission of disease and parasites. Migratory beekeepers move their hives across the country for pollination and this practice has the potential to spread disease and pests not just among honey bee colonies, but to wild bees as well. The shortage of bees in some cases has increased the distance some beekeepers must move their hives to help farmers pollinate their crops and this compounds the problem.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHoneybees may also have large impacts on native plant communities and natural ecosystems. For example, honeybees can help non-native plants outcompete native plants by enhancing seed set through pollination (Barthell et al. 2001). Spread of invasive plants can distract native bees from their native plant mutualisms, which can lead to further negative effects on biodiversity (Traveset &amp; Richardson 2006). Honeybees can also damage flowers and steal nectar and pollen from flowers without pollinating them, which can affect native plant persistence over time (Rust 1979; Carmo et al. 2004; Hargreaves et al. 2009).\u00bb</span>", "filename": "Apis_mellifera_Western_honey_bee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1923, "h": 1599, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 207, "tim": 1674517957377120, "time": 1674517957, "md5": "DSoL6DS5FdNPuFSZX9QsoQ==", "fsize": 2392656, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-beekeeping-good-or-bad-for-the-environment", "replies": 27, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 15148478, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148470</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations, because they compete directly for nectar and pollen. That\u2019s not a problem when flowers are plentiful, but in environments where resources are limited, wild bees can be outcompeted. A lack of flowers is one of the main factors behind the decline in bee populations. Initiatives such as urban beekeeping put more pressure on wild bees and worsen the decline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honeybees are extremely efficient at collecting pollen and returning it to their hives, but as a consequence they transfer little to the flowers they visit. They are quantifiably less effective at pollination than wild bees, so changes in foraging patterns also have knock-on consequences for the plant community. When honeybees occur in high numbers, they can push wild bees out of an area, making it harder for wild plants to reproduce. Honeybees are not a substitute for wild pollinators, so we must protect the entire bee community to achieve good quality pollination.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh densities of honey bee colonies increase competition between native pollinators for forage, putting even more pressure on the wild species that are already in decline. Honey bees are extreme generalist foragers and monopolize floral resources, thus leading to exploitative competition\u2014that is, where one species uses up a resource, not leaving enough to go around.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bringing in honey bees reduced the connectedness of the plant-pollinator networks.

Unfortunately, it is probably the case that Murray and Herrnstein&#039;s observations about IQ being distributed on a bell curve and there are differences in the means between racial groups is probably true. It also the case that IQ and the Flynn effect have been stagnant for fifty years in western countries. Actually ethnic Europeans in the USA have regressed a couple points since the 90s. What does all this mean though, there is a reason it is taboo to talk race and intellect, the elites and systems don&#039;t want to give ammunition to real discrimination against ethnic Africans that are on the right side of the distribution since it doesn&#039;t go along with the individualist moral system and it&#039;s mildly inefficient usage of the population&#039;s intellectual talent. Also there are other traits beside IQ that matter like conscientiousness, neuroticism, and industriousness. There are plenty, even if they have a low average IQ that can and do contribute to society in meaningful ways.

Once the physical system (universe) is shown to be a contingent entity (it is contingent because it began, so it demands an explanation/cause), then there follows the logical necessity for and entity possessing at least some of the attributes commonly ascribed to god, namely the ability to initiate systems such as the physical (virtual) universe, and the attribute of not being temporally constrained. So not bound by time (cycles). The non-contingent entity (god) is called a necessary being in philosophical terms. Aquinas coined this term. Leibnitz formed arguments based on this concept as well. It was a way to express informally logically the necessity for a creator without bringing a particular theology into it. So the contingent being (universe) demands a cause/explanation for it&#039;s existence. the cause can&#039;t itself also be contingent, ie have a beginning, or else you get an infinite regress of contingent entities, ie &#039;well, if god created the universe, then who created god&#039;, ad infinitum. So the regress can be avoided by just postulating a single entity which wasn&#039;t itself booted up, ie not temporally constrained, ie didn&#039;t begin/outside of time (cycles).
