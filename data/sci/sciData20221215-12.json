But you might as well ask what causes people to burn out of their jobs. PhDs vary hugely between countries, fields, groups and individual supervisors. Some PIs literally do not give a fuck if you don&#039;t do anything for a year, others micromanage every hour of your day. Both can be stressful. Personally, the workload wasn&#039;t that bad; at the end of the day, the bar for getting a PhD is pretty low. However, there is a far greater amount of things that you could/should be doing if you actually want to stand out among competition, to the extent that doing it all is simply not possible. There&#039;s publications, conferences, networking, teaching, outreach, research, getting funding, applying for positions, keeping up with literature, learning new shit, list goes on. And of course your work is made public and your output measured by metrics seen by anyone. So there&#039;s always something you should be doing that&#039;s knocking at the back of your head, and you&#039;re constantly comparing yourself to countless peers many of whom are just better.

It is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralization and barbarism combined.</span><br><br>This was from the Economist describing why Russia was getting its ass kicked in Crimea back in 1854. <br><br>Corruption is a way of life in Russia, and the only things that can be said to run efficiently are the ones that the the Czar or General Secretary have a direct interest in. Things did better under the Soviets because the powers of the police state let the Politburo keep a personal eye on a lot more things. With the collapse of the USSR a lot of that was lost in favor of the economy being divided up into neofeudal fiefdoms, which left the people in charge free to loot and enrich themselves off the old Soviet glories. The Soviet space sector was torn to pieces by this, and by the fact that we were recruiting soviet aerospace engineers as fast as Lockheed could convince the State Department to give them visas.", "time": 1671073327, "resto": 15053446}, {"no": 15054736, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:06:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15054706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15054706</a><br>At least they could send an uncrewed Soyuz to replace MS-22.", "time": 1671073616, "resto": 15053446}, {"no": 15054741, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)22:09:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15054706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15054706</a><br>my understanding is that there is 2 cooling loops and only one skeeted its load.

A Falcon 9 rocket, owned and operated by billionaire Elon Musk&#039;s commercial launch company SpaceX, was set to liftoff before dawn on Thursday from the Vandenberg U.S. Space Force Base, about 170 miles (275 km) northwest of Los Angeles, to carry SWOT into orbit. If all goes as planned, the SUV-sized satellite will produce research data within several months. Nearly 20 years in development, SWOT incorporates advanced microwave radar technology that scientists say will collect height-surface measurements of oceans, lakes, reservoirs and rivers in high-definition detail over 90% of the globe. The data, compiled from radar sweeps of the planet at least twice every 21 days, will enhance ocean-circulation models, bolster weather and climate forecasts and aid in managing scarce freshwater supplies in drought-stricken regions, according to researchers. One major thrust of the mission is to explore how oceans absorb atmospheric heat and carbon dioxide in a natural process that moderates global temperatures and climate change.

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.", "filename": "TIMESAND___Sixty-Six_Theses__v2-20220726-1-146", "ext": ".pdf", "w": 1, "h": 1, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671099136261103, "time": 1671099136, "md5": "chqEc4Het78s4cfFWBfYvQ==", "fsize": 2818474, "resto": 15054946}, {"no": 15055251, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)05:13:06", "name": "Jealous", "com": "http://gg762.net/d0cs/papers/Sixty-<wbr>Six_Theses__v2-20220726.pdf", "filename": "TIMESAND___Sixty-Six_Theses__v2-20220726-146-306", "ext": ".pdf", "w": 1, "h": 1, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671099186709677, "time": 1671099186, "md5": "fYR8mqE9+S1Utkstkilo2g==", "fsize": 2176112, "resto": 15054946}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15044058, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:32:14", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "How smart was he really?", "com": "His mathematical workings seem to be genius-tier.", "filename": "232332", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 166, "h": 221, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 221, "tim": 1670715134234668, "time": 1670715134, "md5": "ury6TjSCgw70VhnHM4PFbA==", "fsize": 10848, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-smart-was-he-really", "replies": 65, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 46}, {"no": 15044060, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Almost as smart as Roadmap Shaq", "time": 1670715289, "resto": 15044058}, {"no": 15044062, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:35:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15044058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15044058</a><br>Take your meds, schizo.", "time": 1670715343, "resto": 15044058}, {"no": 15044064, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:36:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15044062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15044062</a><br><br>why", "filename": "1638702337228", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 996, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 121, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670715387057461, "time": 1670715387, "md5": "FHKXyOpkT20eCHZEof+ofA==", "fsize": 149514, "resto": 15044058}, {"no": 15044083, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:46:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15044058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15044058</a><br>He has an IQ of 167 which means he&#039;s certianly a genius, however I don&#039;t think he took his math work to seriously and even said he viewed math as nothing more than a game.", "time": 1670715963, "resto": 15044058}, {"no": 15044108, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)18:58:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15044083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15044083</a><br>I believe that was from a childhood placement test at his elementary school.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented.

If a retard finds a particular class difficult, then he should perhaps not take other difficult classes in tandem with it, focus more, take courses of an easier difficulty.

It&#039;s a lot like my coded-to-the-bone-portable mental math solution to the compound slope equation, which I created fall 2000-spring 2001, and was stolen by Q/DARPA and fenced to fund the 9/11/2001 terror attacks. It can&#039;t be consolidated any further, and it doesn&#039;t have any true external dependencies. It&#039;s extremely basic math and physics, done correctly, in a way that is truly universal. See: all scientific advancement since early 2020. Many IP are stolen from me.

Since there is in the whole universe neither an intelligent force nor an eternal force (mankind, for all its yearnings, has yet to succeed in inventing a perpetual motion machine), we must assume that this force that is active within the atom comes from a conscious and intelligent mind.

Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today. If you look in the Bible, however, God&#039;s covenant was a covenant of blood but the people who control the Vatican today have none of that blood.<br><br>Pope dissolves Knights of Malta leadership, issues new constitution<br>https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/new<wbr>s/international/pope-dissolves-knig<wbr>hts-of-malta-leadership-issues-new-<wbr>constitution/", "filename": "TIMESAND___2Chron1019", "ext": ".png", "w": 834, "h": 348, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1670990429509709, "time": 1670990429, "md5": "AQ9VrCjds3IU5mG2VGDAkQ==", "fsize": 13285, "resto": 15037381}, {"no": 15052312, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:20:40", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15037614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More violence from Debra Bridegan, more theft by deception, more bragging about injuring me, more bragging about stripping me of promised and owed continued material disability support--more bragging about pretending that DB is &quot;authorized&quot; to lie to Miles and I while exploiting us violently, directly and indirectly.</span><br>This false allegation of authorization is relevant to my interests.

You didn&#039;t answer the question. I would like evidence that links specific brain cells to the creation of a specific thought or concept in a way that can be repeatedly demonstrated and for added bonus point, show how a completely different set of brain cells in two different people&#039;s heads can produce the same concept in two different minds to where we can know what one another are talking about, namely infinity in this case. Or, cut to the chase and tell me how a piece of objectively observable meat beams a non-objectively observable subjective experience into an observer. And explain why consciousness, if it is a physical object, can not be objectively observed as all other physical objects can be? What is the mechanism whereby this piece of meat actually transmits this non-material concept of infinity or any other concept to the experiencer?<br>point being pic related. Consciousness is not physical. Consciousness is made of consciousness, not brain or matter. Consciousness IS, because of a high level of immersion in the physical (virtual) world, constrained in certain ways by physicality that that can be observed and experienced neural correlatively, but that shouldn&#039;t be mistaken for consciousness being made of matter or it being a physical substance. So the number of cells in a physical (virtual) brain is irrelevant to what a mind can conceive of. In point of fact, brains, as is all other matter, are only ever observed as MENTAL OBJECTS in minds. And this by the way is why infinities are grounded in minds, not in the physical world. No infinities in the physical world, no continuities, no analyticity.

The reason normal people can withstand all the pain is because for the most part, they are unaware of it. But most of the time, people have &#039;aches and pains&#039;. Its caused by their physical habits and they can usually pinpoint exactly what caused various pains, and these sources of pain are amenable to various non-drug interventions. <br><br>The pain that drug-seekers feel is different. Its enhanced by obliterated dopamine receptors. The experiences of sensitivity and pain are intermittent, and even normal, but to these people, tnhings feel incredibly bad. Its a consequence of their blown out receptors. The pain itself is not a symptom and not something that can be cured. Instead they have to adjust (or readjust) to baseline reality. If someone is super-addicted, a course of methadone can be tried, but this requires far more discipline than a drug addict usually has, and liability if they go back to using is probable . <br><br>Doctors ask questions of patients to understand and diagnose symptoms that they can target with specific medicines and treatments.

They (the NNSA) seemed quite pleased that tritium&#039;s decay into deuterium would not result in fizzled detonations if the U.S. chose not to perform scheduled core swaps; a cost-cutting measure previously thought to be too risky. Since fusion-based weapons require a fission trigger and those fission triggers are what are termed &#039;enhanced fission bombs,&#039; being that those enhanced bombs depend upon a tritium source, there had for decades been an assumption that a tritium component too much of which was decayed into deuterium would not generate enough neutrons to sufficiently enhance the fission portion of the package to support fusion.", "time": 1670993786, "resto": 15052347, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15052352, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:57:37", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "That said, as far as fusion power goes, magnetic confinement of what is essentially a gluon-quark plasma is the only viable method for sustaining a practical fusion reaction.

My suggestion on those dates was to begin incorporating gluons (in 2020) and odderons (in 2021.) I prescribed a method for generating large numbers of strong attractors which could be used to overcome the Coulomb repulsion of like-charge protons. I specifically suggested passing protons near one another at relativistic velocities and that in the time these protons are in proximity, gluons would issue forth from the protons, potentially even interacting to become neutrons or better yet, odderons.

I have a complex statistics problem I need help with. I am no slouch at math and have placed extremely well in contests and academics, but my statistics skills are weak. I&#039;m sorry for having said in the past that stats isn&#039;t &quot;real&quot; math.<br><br>Basically, I have a bunch of unknowns and want to derive a formula for a probability which I will then attempt to minimize. I think that last part is more squarely in the domain of calculus, so I&#039;m not so worried about it, but first I need to derive the formula using statistics.<br><br>The problem is that the unknowns describe distributions, at least one of which is highly skewed (not normal), and everything follows from these distributions, ie, operations on distributions like sampling or combining them in ways that go beyond the basic calculus on the normal distribution that I am familiar with from high school.<br><br>Solving this problem is important enough to me that I am willing to spend money on it. Unfortunately, I know programmers and engineers, but no statisticians.<br><br>How does /sci/ suggest I go about solving this? Can I go to a local university and proposition some stats professor to tell his students to meet with me for the opportunity to submit a bid to solve my problem? Should I post flyers or on some freelance site, or hire a tutor? Again, I stress that this is fairly advanced statistics, probably junior or senior undergraduate level *at least*, I&#039;m not entirely sure. (The underlying motivation is PhD level CS, but that isn&#039;t relevant to solving the stats portion.)

When we are taking the n dimensional Hausdorff measure in n-dimensional Euclidean space, it equals the Lebesgue measure, so for the time you can think of it as an &quot;extended&quot; Lebesgue measure. For now, let me show you an example of using the coarea formula. <br><br>Suppose we are working over [math]\\mathbb{R}^3[/math]. Here, we&#039;ll let [math]g \\equiv 1[/math] and [math]u:(x, y, z) \\mapsto z[/math] be the projection onto the z-axis. The goal is to compute the volume of the cone [math]\\Omega[/math] of height h and base radius R, based at the origin, and vertical axis being the z-axis. Therefore, the expression [eqn]\\int_\\Omega g(x) |\\nabla u(x)| dx = \\int_\\Omega dx[/eqn] is going to lend for us the volume of this cone. The coarea formula allows us to rewrite this integral in terms of the level sets of u. For any [math]t \\in \\mathbb{R}[/math], the set [math]u^{-1}(t)[/math] is precisely the disk given at a height of t up the cone. The radius of this disk is given by [eqn]r_t = \\frac{R(h - t)}{h}[/eqn] Then, the inner integral is simply going to produce the area of such a disk, and the integral over R will be replaced with the integral from 0 to the height of the cone.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

The number six million, specifically, was showing up in numerous newspapers prior to WW2, back to around 1900, in articles and donation advertisements talking about the many starving semites in Eastern Europe and things of that nature. We&#039;re not talking two or three examples, but dozens of them across a variety of papers.

What has been a phenomenon however, is that high intelligence posters frequently crossboard, including activity on /pol/. We saw a heightened effort posting spectacle during Covid 19 where many autistic and gifted individuals were sharing their pertinent information anecdotal or referential to them at the time. From physicists to geneticists to engineers of all kinds, /pol/ saw major action from people deeply intertwined in the vaccination process or intimate knowledge of biology, mathematics, and general stem/med. It stands to reason from this activity that there was a validity to browse /pol/ to find new arguments being made on whether one should take a vaccine or refuse it, and how to protect one\u2019s self from Covid since the rest of the Internet implemented intense, authoritarian slave control of what could be posted by their users, bans were handed out like candy by anyone who was interested in real discussion. <br><br>Conclusion: /pol/ has a use case just like /sci/, that in when major happenings occur in the world, some intelligent people do find their ways to certain nefarious areas of the internet, and it is useful to engage or lurk for their opinions, even if it means wading through troughs of pure unfiltered shit.

Turns out I have autism and aspergers and I was put on disability payments and given medication etc. It made sense because of all the problems at work and I did terribly at school too, got one of the worst gpas they&#039;d ever had.
