I wanted to go into a field in which I have many options and thus thought mechatronics would be the way to go, and actually cybersecurity was on my list as well since I watched a lot of videos on that and did some firmware reverse engineering and so on.<br>I ended up studying physics, and I am very happy with it. If you don&#039;t have any experience with university yet and have to decide what to do it is easy to fall into the trap of associating majors directly with what you will work on later in your life. Mechatronical systems are cool as hell and having an understanding of all the parts sounds great, but in practice you will probably just end up doing one niche part for some bigger system and your goal should be to optimize your chances to get into more interesting niches and not to get an understanding of as many niches as possible. And that&#039;s where math or physics graduates set themselves apart. With a deeper knowledge of math compared to the average engineer they can often get assigned the more &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; tasks. I put those in quotes because that of course is highly subjective, but in many fields you will realize that in order to understand and work with the more elementary methods, you need to have a really good understanding of math first.<br>Take for example cryptography as a really interesting sub-field of cybersecurity. It is the most math heavy, but working in this field will be much more interesting (at least in my opinion) than doing basic pentesting stuff where you don&#039;t even need to know how the exploits work and just use some scanners on different servers every day.<br><br>Of course you should take this just as inspiration to think in another direction from someone who changed his mind from wanting to do engineering to actual science.

It&#039;s rare to find a schizo who tries to disprove someone accomplished but less popularly known like Post, Heisenberg, Erdos etc).<br>- Incapable of deep engagement with a topic. You never see schizos actually read a whole academic book on a topic they like to expound upon. Their knowledge consists solely of hearsay, popular culture and youtube videos.", "time": 1672426548, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089185, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:50:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088516</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnW<wbr>BatqbwEk", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-30 16-49-36", "ext": ".png", "w": 972, "h": 770, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1672447801526477, "time": 1672447801, "md5": "Ws5irhNQhJg8uQ7QFBtBPg==", "fsize": 401952, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089188, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:51:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;radio</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;polyphase ac</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;logic gates</span>", "filename": "who-was-tesla", "ext": ".png", "w": 891, "h": 606, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1672447861994916, "time": 1672447861, "md5": "LeNbB7K3K7JikHbsCT71Fg==", "fsize": 190977, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089191, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:52:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088516</a>", "filename": "Screenshot from 2022-12-30 16-51-39", "ext": ".png", "w": 486, "h": 511, "tn_w": 118, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672447922670653, "time": 1672447922, "md5": "tTy6SRZNGp7QVuIYykVw8g==", "fsize": 187459, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089196, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:53:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088516</a><br>quasicrystals (rotational symmetry)", "filename": "girih-tiles", "ext": ".png", "w": 2366, "h": 2060, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1672448038744525, "time": 1672448038, "md5": "NcwQjZi32i5MUZFq47jbKA==", "fsize": 2614825, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089255, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)20:17:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15080584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15080584</a><br>Just read any sacred geometry 101", "time": 1672449438, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15089895, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)03:54:52", "name": "bodhi", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088516</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s rare to find a schizo who tries to disprove someone accomplished but less popularly known like Post, Heisenberg, Erdos etc).</span><br>Einstein was wrong and lauded as some mega-galaxy brain and entire false paradigms have built on his work that has retarded science and kept it at a standstill for nearly a century which is why people smart enough to know he is a fraud -unlike yourself- call him out for his nonsense.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

What we have yet to cover is Covid. This reporting, for The Free Press, @TheFP, is one piece of that important story. <br><br>4. The United States government pressured Twitter and other social media platforms to elevate certain content and suppress other content about Covid-19. <br><br>5. Internal files at Twitter that I viewed while on assignment for @TheFP showed that both the Trump and Biden administrations directly pressed Twitter executives to moderate the platform\u2019s pandemic content according to their wishes. <br><br>6. At the onset of the pandemic, according to meeting notes, the Trump admin was especially concerned about panic buying. They came looking for \u201chelp from the tech companies to combat misinformation\u201d about \u201cruns on grocery stores.\u201d But . . . there were runs on grocery stores.<br><br>7. It wasn\u2019t just Twitter. The meetings with the Trump White House were also attended by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others.<br><br>8. When the Biden admin took over, one of their first meeting requests with Twitter executives was on Covid. The focus was on \u201canti-vaxxer accounts.\u201d Especially Alex Berenson:<br><br>9. In the summer of 2021, president Biden said social media companies were \u201ckilling people\u201d for allowing vaccine misinformation. Berenson was suspended hours after Biden\u2019s comments, and kicked off the platform the following month. <br>https://alexberenson.substack.com/p<wbr>/jesse-jackson-cant-swim", "filename": "Fk6SbqgX0AI4O7z", "ext": ".png", "w": 733, "h": 546, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 186, "tim": 1672104128581221, "time": 1672104128, "md5": "e8ahO60GchjuEMROOZaRlQ==", "fsize": 650248, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-fbi-twitter-rigged-covid-science", "replies": 160, "images": 52, "unique_ips": 47}, {"no": 15080027, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)20:23:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "10.

Chris Fucks is a pansy man, you can read about Chris Fucks here and about his pansy methods<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_<wbr>measurement<br>That whole thing about you can&#039;t measure a system without disturbing it is BULLSHIT. I bet you a zillion dollars it&#039;s possible to do it. I don&#039;t know how, maybe Chris Fucks knows, I don&#039;t know, but I know its possible. If we can do spooky sex action from a distance we can do this. Fuck you. I hate you. But anyway, what I&#039;m saying is I think we need better measurement tools for going deeper. We don&#039;t need more theories about 12 dimensional rubber things with strings hanging off them floating all around space banging into eachother and shit, that shit is gay and it&#039;s time to snap out of it and make some shit that works.

You need a more advanced set of axioms, like Kolmogorov&#039;s (which was made to deal with such problems). It defines the probability sample space omega as a set of all outcomes, with a probability function that maps each to a probability, such that the sum of all elements probability is 1. Events of interest are subsets of the sample space. This permits using probability functions for infinities. <br><br>Any infinite sequence of non zero probability samples has a probability function that approaches zero. But the number of events of interest, ie the cardinality of the set of events of interest, is infinite. <br><br>But as can be seen from <a href=\"#p15089061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089061</a> <a href=\"#p15089069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089069</a> <a href=\"#p15089077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089077</a>, infinity cannot be thought of as an integer. Paradoxes also arise from infinity when rigorously defined. For example, the cardinality of the set of all even numbers is not smaller than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers. <br><br>Strictly speaking, the axiomatic understanding is that it is probability 0, given that its the probability of the sample space minus non infinitely recurring heads at some point, which is 1 - 1.

Outside of the hard sciences everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Hell, even some area of the hard sciences are highly suspect (e.g. String Theory). Many people, including those in scientific fields, have a very cargo cult approach to science. To them science is something published in a respectable enough journal and with p&lt;0.05. The soft sciences have been a joke for decades and are effectively just a propaganda arm for the Party. I don&#039;t think scientific inquiry will grind to a halt, but it will slow down, and some research will become verboten in the west. This is a list of things that I think we will not research anymore in the near future:<br>- nuclear fission for power generation (The money is on fusion now)<br>- heritability of human traits and in general everything that could show inherent disparity in abilities between humans and between human groups<br>- gain of function research (just kidding lol)<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672337652, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086184, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:15:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15086180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15086180</a><br>I&#039;m especially mad about the current situation of nuclear research. I can sort of accept the pozzing of research that goes directly against the dogmas of the woke religion, but the corruption of nuclear research really shows how power driven scientists have become. To the layman the recent breakthrough in fusion sounds like a great achievement but to someone who has actually mastered elementary school mathematics it only shows how scientist would lie (mostly by omission, but that&#039;s still a lie) only to gain funding and status for themselves. We could phase out fossil fuels in less than a decade, for electricity generation at least, using the nuclear technology we already have. If you want to get fancy you could start building pilot power plants based on the Thorium cycle and/or other new gen reactors. Instead we are funding boondoggles like fusion that will likely not be able to generate useful power for the next few decades. Or pouring money in meme stuff like renewables and hydrogen. To work well science requires a rather high degree of honesty, a degree of honesty that is above the paygrade of most people.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was magistrate of Jincheng at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. Thus a serpent or some kind of marine snake (chhen) had certainly been turned to stone, as happens with the &#039;stone-crabs&#039;.[13][14]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was thus revealed. It contained several hundred bamboo with their roots and trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in Wuzhou there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though they are not produced in that place today.
