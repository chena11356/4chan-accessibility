The best mathematicians are the ones who learn it as a language and have the confidence to be creative and experimental with it. I originally learned math so that I wouldn&#039;t fail tests, and I never dared to improvise or be creative with it because that could result in failure. Now I&#039;m more successful than either of my parents and they take credit for it because they &quot;helped&quot; me learn math by shouting at me whenever I made a mistake as a child.<br>I know I can get through most math that I encounter.

While this filter is mainly anthropomorphic, the language filter is an interesting problem, I think.<br><br>It is commonly believed that language and writing are important because it allows people to spread knowledge, create ideas, conjecture new ones, and error-correct upon other ideas. This is true because 1) without language, we would not be able to communicate efficiently to our brethren that, say in the cavemen era, &quot;This area over here is full of lions, don&#039;t go there!&quot; or &quot;this area is full of deer, let&#039;s hunt here,&quot; and 2) without writing, we would have a hard time accumulating knowledge because people would die and thus their knowledge dies with them. <br><br>But the problem with both language and writing, at least to humans, is that both methods of communications are linear, despite the fact that the universe is non-linear. Take for example the paragraph I wrote above: notice how it progresses in a straight-forward fashion. Or look at any complete sentence and how it flows in a linear fashion: subject, verb, and object\u2014Mary sucks cock.<br><br>This limits our abilities to understanding the universe because the universe is not strictly linear. And because we speak and write in a linear fashion, we are thus misinterpreting the universe everyday. <br><br>One counter-argument: we interpret the universe through our sense, thus interpreting the universe nonlinearly. We soak in our environment through sight, hearing, smelling, touch, and more. This goes to show that the brain is completely capable of understanding the universe in a nonlinear fashion. But the counter-argument against the counter-argument is that our senses are easily manipulatable.<br><br>For use to pass the language filter, we need a method of understanding the universe in its nonlinear operation of itself, to &quot;see&quot; everything all at once, as opposed to a linear approach.", "filename": "0yjG34n5W933ZtVp0UNFR85-5joDidCqvC74MXEpGog", "ext": ".png", "w": 750, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 107, "tim": 1670652080480328, "time": 1670652080, "md5": "LTJ3W5r8fa7KBIX9qJ1DLQ==", "fsize": 157719, "resto": 15042707}, {"no": 15042770, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)01:13:21", "name": "bias", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042757</a><br>I live for 100,000 years, and can reproduce for over 90,000 of them.

Nonetheless, I will attempt to answer both.<br><br>Why did we develop writing? _Why_ questions are hard to answer because it would make an &quot;answer&quot; too overly deterministic. There are many approaches to why we developed writing. One reason: we had to accurately keep track of each other\u2014who was indebted, who said what, who promised what, etc, &quot;It was written and agreed upon in stone,&quot; type of scenario. Second: efficient learning\u2014it is easier to read at 1000+ words per minute than to speak 1000+ words per minute, let alone 300. Third: messaging each other\u2014easier to write a scroll and have someone deliver it across villages than it was to travel and speak in person. Fourth, similar to the third reason: mass distribution of knowledge\u2014easier to print 10,000 scrolls and have each scrolls repeatedly read by others, than it was to speak to a small audience. There are plenty of other reasons, but the gist is that writing allows people to &quot;clone&quot; themselves and have that clone do the communicating.<br><br>As for needing writing in the first place? I think there are faster means of communications, such as sight, which acts upon the speed of light, but inherently slowed by electro-chemical processes of the brain, but is still faster than writing. Perhaps there&#039;s a way for people to communicate without directly speaking or writing to each other via internet-like telepathy. Or perhaps a flashdrive that you could plug into others.

Our planet remains a tectonically and volcanically active world -- witness the current eruptions in Hawaii -- while Mars has been a cold, geologically dead place for the past three billion years. That was the thinking at least. But a new paper in Nature Astronomy challenges that accepted wisdom. Mars, it suggests, may still be geologically active today. The findings are the result of orbital photography, surface data, and computer modeling of a lowland region near the Martian equator known as Elysium Planitia -- where NASA&#039;s Mars InSight probe landed in 2018. Researchers from the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory analyzed recordings of Mars quakes taken by InSight and concluded that they all result from a series of subsurface fissures dubbed Cerberus Fossae, which stretch nearly 1,300 km (800 mi.) across the Martian surface. This gives rise to what are known as mantle plumes: blob-like masses of molten rock that rise to reach the base of the crust, causing quakes, faulting, and volcanic eruptions. Computer modeling of the region indicates that far from being geologically dead, <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elysium Planitia experienced major volcanic eruptions as recently as 200 million years ago.</span>", "filename": "1661541053889367", "ext": ".png", "w": 369, "h": 569, "tn_w": 162, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670619836932940, "time": 1670619836, "md5": "/G84tnToqUfRQB5WMOafhw==", "fsize": 344513, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "active-volcano-in-mars", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15042271, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)17:54:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042094</a><br>there could be milk on mars according to that pic", "time": 1670626454, "resto": 15042094}, {"no": 15042375, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:28:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": ".", "time": 1670632119, "resto": 15042094}, {"no": 15042964, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)05:23:18", "name": "N", "com": "have you actually seen this basedakboard solving any problems in the past xDD<br><br>basedentists of this board are left here by god to test your faith bro", "time": 1670667798, "resto": 15042094}], "last_modified": 1670667798}, {"no": 15042957, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)05:09:50", "name": "Where is the BEAUTY?

Negative Coulomb Force Lines, Positive Coulomb Force Lines, Saltwater, an Autoclave, and Pulsed Soliton Waves<br><br>In my recent publication concerning the origin of elements heavier than zinc, I concluded that while the first thirty elements of the periodic table likely did have their origin in the center of a star, the currently prevailing theory which holds that colliding neutron stars are responsible for the formation of heavier elements is fallacious. I expounded that these heavier elements gradually accrue protons in parts of the saltwater oceans that extend below the sea floor over hundreds of millions of years and are ultimately ejected during rare undersea volcanic eruptions (the same ones associated with mass extinction events.)<br><br>If this is so, we can deduce that probability comes into play when it comes to whether any given water-associated hydrogen atom will approach an atom of a heavy element and successfully penetrate its electron cloud. I came to the conclusion that if, perchance, a moment in time existed in which the many electrons of an element like zinc were to briefly shift to a single hemisphere of the orbital space around that atom (an exceptionally rare but not implausible state,) if a hydrogen were to choose that instant to stray into proximity of the zinc (or any heavy element,) when those electrons returned to a more balanced hemispheric distribution around the atom, they would act as a guillotine, severing the hydrogen from the water. Now liberated from the water and trapped between the electron cloud and nucleus of the heavy element, the proton would be assimilated, creating a new element.", "filename": "Larisa-Oleynik-7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 384, "h": 558, "tn_w": 172, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670643428884485, "time": 1670643428, "md5": "ldldeoRgFxj9t4MaEIkPbA==", "fsize": 24188, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-wouldnt-patent-the-sun", "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15042614, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)22:37:44", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "This aspect of this hypothetical phenomenon holds in common with another of my hypotheses the feature of electrons having probabilistic alignments of position, leading to phenomena. The other phenomenon for which this clockwork-like trait of electrons comes into play is nuclear decay, which I firmly believe is triggered by perfect alignments of these electrons. If this is so, these two phenomena of nature are truly poetical as it would mean that the seeming opposites of fusion and decay both rely, in most cases, upon chance configurations of electrons.<br><br>To prove this theory and to make something useful from it, we might try to accelerate this natural process. The first and perhaps most important objective of such an accelerated pressurized saltwater fusion system is to create windows of hemispheric electron imbalance in the transmuting elements.<br><br>The best means for achieving this was first suggested by myself for the application of building improved microwave ovens. If soliton waves can be used to create hemispheric imbalances of electrons for the purpose of maximizing chances of microwave resonances, those same artificially-generated imbalances can allow protons to slip into those electron shells. When an electron slips in, the nucleus is heated. When a proton slips in, a new element is created.<br><br>Firing protons at a heavy element using a particle accelerator doesn&#039;t work for transmutative purposes because the excessive speed denies the proton the chance to gently assimilate into the existing element. This is likely the reason why this means of transmutation has not been hypothesized nor discovered to date; someone undoubtedly already tried to create new elements by violently firing protons at existing elements and failed and thus assumed that what is needed is more force. This sadly mistaken assumption has likely set reseach into this area back by decades.

They convey nearly all of their energy as unidirectional magnetism. Any electrons they encounter in orbit of an atom tend to be swept up by that magnetic force. That force is not quite sufficient to entirely strip away those electrons, ionizing the element, but what a soliton wave can do, in my view, is temporarily shove all of the orbital electrons to one hemisphere, leaving the opposing hemisphere open to particles that might be nudged toward its nucleus.<br><br>If we take some zinc and place it in an autoclave filled with saltwater and crank up the pressure, we can reproduce the conditions under which fusion occurs in the oceans. This process is too slow to be experimentally verified until we add a couple of additional ingredients. The primary and most important ingredient is the soliton pulser, of course, but to this we can add Coulomb Force Line-generative (both positive and negative) structures. The more the water in the autoclave is agitated on the nano-scale, the greater the chance of a hydrogen straying into proximity with the heavy element during a crucial window of opportunity. Saltwater naturally lends itself to this agitation (driving its own resistance to freezing amongst other properties.) If crystals with alignments of positive and negatively charged unit cells (alternatingly) are collocated with the element to be transmuted, we can expect that the normal agitation associated with the repulsions of the sodium chloride cubes snd the V-shaped H2O would be multiplied manifold.<br><br>The technology to build these elements of Artificially Accelerated Pressurized Saltwater Fusion already exists and requires little engineering work to combine into a revolutionary means for generation of rare earth elements.<br><br>The Future Is Made in America<br>09Dec2022", "time": 1670643533, "resto": 15042613, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}], "last_modified": 1670643533}, {"no": 15040640, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:13:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are comets really?", "filename": "comet", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 725, "h": 380, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 131, "tim": 1670548427626716, "time": 1670548427, "md5": "z7TC/0+n9I5y0aEHGSAYcQ==", "fsize": 50131, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-comets-really", "replies": 11, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15040931, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)00:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "frozen smegma", "time": 1670562651, "resto": 15040640}, {"no": 15042490, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the vast majority are real comets, some are probably aliens masking themselves as comets", "time": 1670636656, "resto": 15040640}, {"no": 15042508, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)20:58:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Kosher Salt", "time": 1670637530, "resto": 15040640}, {"no": 15042566, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)21:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15040744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15040744</a><br>under rated", "time": 1670640034, "resto": 15040640}, {"no": 15042607, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)22:27:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15040640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15040640</a><br>Space jews.

An analogy for quantum entanglement is this: imagine you amputate your arm, and ship it to China for analysis. They store it. You, in the USA, send a brain signal through your CNS to wiggle your finger in your amputated arm. The amputated arm responds and wags its finger.<br><br>The concept of a &quot;wormhole&quot; comes from a so-called &quot;einstein-rosen bridge&quot;. This connects two far away regions in space via a tunnel. It&#039;d be like walking out your house door, and instead of going into your front lawn you come out in Narnia. <br><br>They&#039;re both &quot;action at a distance&quot;, but quantum entanglement has nothing to do with wormholes. Quantum entanglement is about information remaining coupled between two particles, despite their distance. You alter the state of one particle, and the other immediately follows tow, regardless of distance. In contrast, with a wormhole you create a portal from one region to another.<br><br>In sum, quantum entanglement requires at least two objects, whose intrinsic behaviors are coupled. A wormhole is a warping of the fabric of space that permits a single object to transport from one region to another instantly. <br><br>The only thing that the two share in common is FTL action-at-a-distance.

I build high power lasers and we&#039;re always trying to push the limits. When I get new material to build a laser, I can spend weeks grinding in a lab testing all of its characteristics, realizing some system doesn&#039;t work, figuring out why, modifying an optical system, etc. At some point we see what would be a useful experiment and focus on that to get some results for a conference/paper etc. Tasks can vary from machining, plumbing and vacuum system assembly to developing control algorithms, splicing fiber-optic components, working with vendors to get custom optics made, getting some custom electronics working, making cad models to get components made by a workshop, or just building a particularly complex optical system. Most of us can do a little bit of everything but we&#039;re not experts in anything. Sometimes some external collaborators show up for a few days with some system they want to test with the new/upgraded laser. If the experiment works out I might spend a few weeks not doing much lab work while I write or simulate. Then either continue adding on to the current system or start over with new stuff. Luckily I build lasers from scratch and don&#039;t usually have to rely on some student&#039;s experimental laser b/c they are rarely built for long-term operation. Occasionally I jump in on other peoples experiments when they need help. Every so often an administrator asks me to put together some slides, diagrams or a video to advertise our work, or even to give a presentation or lab tour to some VIPs. Then the admin tells me to get back in the lab and make them more money. two or three times a year I travel to a conference somewhere.<br><br>Have also worked in industry and a non-uni research institute.

This is why humans are physically weak for their size compared to a variety of animals of similar sizes. Their muscles are designed for things like generating speed to outrun a predator or catch prey or lifting their body weight to swing through trees as a mode of transportation without exhausting themselves. And this is without training or exercise, just a normal and expected development for those species.
