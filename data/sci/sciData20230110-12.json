McKinsey itself has as revenue the GDP of a small country so if they get involved they can move more money around than the politicians can even imagine. However even in rich nations consultants seem to be generally detrimental. There was that famous story of how McKinsey charged the french government $500,000 just to give a presentation, and then due to scheduling issues said presentation never happened. It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

Climate science has always been difficult to find strong footing for. Meteorology is hard enough and it&#039;s just a week down the road. There are so many factors that we cannot viably measure and do not know that it gets very messy quickly, we can&#039;t fully predict how the climate system will work unless we are sure about how most of the parts work with good certainty (which we don&#039;t), we can make predictions based on historical data and models but we don&#039;t have hard-fast equations that we can depend on like other fields do.<br>If you&#039;re wondering why you keep seeing bullshit, it&#039;s because of the media and now politics. I fucking hate the scientific reporting that goes on. What we&#039;re most certain of is that more CO2 in the atmosphere = higher temperatures (on average). When people say things like &quot;Sea levels are rising&quot;, &quot;Glaciers won&#039;t exist&quot;, or &quot;The ocean will acidify&quot; they are drawing conclusions based on the vague but solid postulation that CO2 in the atmosphere = higher temperatures, and the very provable fact that humans are emitting CO2 into the atmosphere (some of these implications are more viable than others). Once they get these morsels, whether they get them from some quite corner of the academic community or out of their own ass, they are free to write all sorts of bullshit news stories to grab views and clicks telling you what the science says.<br>That was back in the day, now we&#039;ve got politics in the mix and it&#039;s all fucked to shit.", "filename": "1652798612183", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 472, "h": 298, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1673327699195255, "time": 1673327699, "md5": "W6WG8gG1Id/dd0noy/vAug==", "fsize": 26014, "resto": 15111387}, {"no": 15112880, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15112781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15112781</a><br>This is the opposite of true.

He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.<br>In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because &quot;nobody wants it.&quot; Really? That&#039;s his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don&#039;t want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.", "filename": "Bill+nye+saves+nothing+i+was+expecting+more_6ee47a_6481043", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673289123181194, "time": 1673289123, "md5": "Dxz4V4HkKckp+FliQMyuJQ==", "fsize": 141755, "resto": 15089892}, {"no": 15111409, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:33:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn&#039;t reduce the acidity level of a solution.

Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don&#039;t know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn&#039;t change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy).

If you want to know about the linear algebra which surrounds functional analysis, then by all means read this book, but much of the material is nonstandard and a bit curious from the perspective of mainstream linear algebra; projections seem to be the most important linear map, and there are many sections lovingly devoted to commuting projections, decomposing projections, etc. I still am not sure why Halmos deifies the [,] as much as he does, and quite honestly, I would learn multilinear algebra anywhere but here.</span>", "time": 1673291271, "resto": 15110838}, {"no": 15111517, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:17:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15110838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15110838</a><br>What is the Aluffi Chapter 0 of Linear Algebra equivalent?

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

There are several ways to treat myopia, including the following:<br><br>Eyeglasses: Eyeglasses are a common and effective treatment for myopia. They correct vision by bending light rays to focus on the retina, allowing you to see clearly.<br><br>Contact lenses: Contact lenses work in the same way as eyeglasses, but they are worn directly on the surface of the eye. They are a good alternative to eyeglasses for some people.<br><br>Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery, such as LASIK, can correct myopia by reshaping the cornea to allow light rays to focus properly on the retina. This can be a permanent solution to myopia, but it is important to note that it is not without risks.<br><br>Orthokeratology: Orthokeratology, also known as &quot;ortho-k,&quot; is a non-surgical treatment that uses special contact lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia.

Everything you&#039;re saying makes sense, but I&#039;ve suddenly developed slight double vision at age 33 and glasses do correct it.

I was competitive in backstroke and long distance running in school and in university while I only lifted weights I wasn&#039;t unfit.

Well, for night time driving and screen reading at least. I fucking hate it. I might as well resign myself to being a genetic dead-end. The fucking diagnosis today has fucking devastated me. The only thing keeping me going is that I know I have MGD and I&#039;m hoping if I can cure it maybe my shit will correct itself. I&#039;ve been putting off heating my eyes for three years because it sounds fucking horrible but if it&#039;s that or glasses I&#039;ll pick the heat packs.

But ultimately, what you are asking about is repairing consciousness. Your brain, like all matter, in order to reduce computational complexity, is only rendered upon observation/measurement and will likely never even have to be rendered (have defined values of observables such as position and momentum) during the course of your entire life. And so a brain in spacetime is not causing/effecting your quality of consciousness. Your brain, if measured/observed, would only ever reflect, in some cases, CORRELATIVE relationships with quality of consciousness through neuro metrics. This has to do with the physical world being informational (virtual) though and it is not vital, necessarily to your question. SO for all practical purposes, YES, through freewill decisions, good ones, you CAN repair/rewire your virtual brain AND, you can improve your quality of consciousness, See pic rel for HOW to do this with regard to porn and fap. BTW, you can effect your physiology in other ways through focused intent of the mind in terms of healing your self, ie through placebo effect, as has been shown through improvement through tangible physiological metrics time and time again.

Here, he was placed under the tutelage of Patrick Blackett, an experimental physicist later made famous for his work on cosmic rays and paleomagnetism. This was not a successful pairing; due to his own ineptitude in the laboratory, Oppenheimer became envious of Blackett\u2019s skills as an experimental physicist. Indeed, Oppenheimer initially wished to study experimental physics, but was prevented from doing so because of his \u201cclumsiness\u201d in the lab.<br><br>In 1926, in a fit of psychological despair while on vacation in Corsica, Oppenheimer confessed to his two accompanying friends that he had to return to Cambridge immediately. The reason? Before he had left for vacation, he had coated an apple in noxious laboratory chemicals and placed it on Blackett\u2019s desk. Oppenheimer wanted to make sure that Blackett was alright.<br><br>Fortunately, he was. Unfortunately, the university\u2019s administration had been informed of his little \u201cprank\u201d and intended to press charges, because prestigious institutions like Cambridge usually look down on students murdering the faculty. It was only through the intervention of his parents that Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t charged; indeed, he was placed on academic probation and ordered to undergo regular psychiatric evaluations. Finally, at the end of 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge at the invitation of Max Born to study theoretical physics at the University of Gottingen.&quot;<br><br>He was a devoted Communist who formed cabals with other Jews, and a lying rat who seemed to lie about anything and everything including seemingly framing goys as spies to remove them from the project, which he of course was joined on by no other than king fraud himself Einstein.", "time": 1673288660, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15111394, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:25:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15110000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15110000</a><br><br>Every goy intellectual like newton, tesla etc. all have the same personality type where they are very reserved, quiet and just want to do their work.

The Simoa antigen assays for spike, S1, and nucleocapsid were previously validated in plasma from pre-pandemic healthy subjects, pre-pandemic patients with respiratory infections, COVID-19 negative patients, and COVID-19 positive patients [7]. Authors detected S1 and N in 64% of COVID-19 positive patients, and S1 levels were significantly associated with disease severity. Here antigens S1 and spike were measured to probe mRNA translation, whereas nucleocapsid antigen served as a negative control (Figures 1A, B, C, Supplementary Table 5). After the first 100-\u00b5g dose, the mRNA-1273 vaccine produced detectable levels of S1 antigen in plasma in 11 participants, and spike antigen was detected in 3 of 13 participants.

While the S1 binding to cells doesn&#039;t result in new viral particles, it does cause inflammation and potential clotting. It&#039;s probably a matter of quantity, and low levels may not be a huge concern. The bigger issue is how many of the LNPs reach circulation.

This anecdotal clinical progress unfolded before my eyes several times with colleagues, patients and other people I knew. When my family or closest friends choose to get vaccinated, I warned them to maintain minimal contact and use FFP2 masks whenever they were in crowded places for the two weeks after the dose was administered and thankfully they listened and nothing bad happened to them. <br><br>It perplexes me how statistical data groups unvaccinated with those vaccinated within 14 days for the purpose of research since that skews any honest discussion regarding the efficacy of the vaccine. An entirely new group should have been created for those who had been vaccinated within 14 days to stratify the reak risk between unvaccinated and vaccinated and assess how dangerous the temporary immunosupression mechanism actually is rather than just ignore it altogether. <br><br>I do believe this was intentional and not merely a slip in design, though.

The problem is that visible light detectors (CCDs) only record intensity information of light. To do interferometry computationally you need both the phase and intensity information, and with CCDs the phase information is gone. At radio wavelengths there is the advantage that a radio antenna can measure both phase and amplitude simultaneously, nothing like that exists in the visible. <br>The only realistic way to do useful interferomtery at visible wavelengths is with direct recombination, like the VLTI and other ground based interferometers. This still requires combining the light with matched path lengths down to a sub-wavelength accuracy. No one knows how to build a formation flying constellation with such tight tolerances, although ESA is pushing the state of the art with Proba 3. For small numbers of telescopes it&#039;s possible to use delay lines for fine adjustment but it doesn&#039;t scale to large numbers. The maximum baseline (related to the resolution) will be set by the precision. Note that even with all these things solved interferometers are niche instruments, they have very small fields of view and nobody knows how to build one which could replace general purpose telescopes.", "time": 1673293498, "resto": 15111220}, {"no": 15111601, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:46:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15111577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15111577</a><br>Oof forgot Beta is supposed to be the next rocket.....", "time": 1673293562, "resto": 15111220}, {"no": 15111612, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:54:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15111497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15111497</a><br>What&#039;s that", "time": 1673294041, "resto": 15111220}, {"no": 15111620, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:57:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;quantum computing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;/x/</span>", "time": 1673294253, "resto": 15111220}, {"no": 15111621, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)14:59:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15111559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15111559</a><br>anyone knows what the f are they launching?

I will add this though, it takes a long time for the process of overstimulation to take effect, and so it takes a long time to heal the mind. Do not despair though. Take more time off of the internet in general though as well and just read. The key is to simplify the amount of things you have to process. The internet, and especially things like 4chan, is a constant stream of novelty, novelty, novelty, ie new, fast moving and constantly updating info. And, things like porn mixed with fap are just off the chart overstimulating. This is over stimulating and eventually, if you want to put it in neurocorralative terms, the brain with take measures to protect itself from over stimulation. So, just as with a drug addiction, the brain will start down regulating things like dopamine reception, and then you get the de-motivation and depression. So the cure is to do simple, less stimulating things such as reading or going for walks in nature. The first response is likely to be &#039;well, screw that, it sounds boring. Maybe at first. When your reward system re-sensitizes though, you will be entertained by the simple life again. You will be more satisfied living the simple life then you were living the over stimulative life. And then you can add the pleasurable things back in moderately. The super stimulative things like porn plus fap, should be avoided.
