You need to combine windmills with storage or build out an obscenely large amount to ensure you have enough electricity to supply at any given time. If you read studies on the EROI on wind, it varies a ton, usually hovering around either 4x and 40x, depending on if they include storage or not. There are different proposals for energy storage, each with their own upsides and downsides. Chemical batteries are the obvious one, but highly expensive and you&#039;d run into lithium shortages before you could do it worldwide. Gravity storage seems moderately promising (lifting concrete with a winch to store energy as gravity potential energy, releasing it to spin a turbine for electrical energy). EROI isn&#039;t the only parameter to design around: financial ROI, product lifecycle, ecological impacts (not just birds, ut also fish for offshore wind), etc. also matter.

A hundred years ago, perhaps, another man sat on this spot; like you he gazed with awe and yearning in his heart at the dying light on the glaciers. Like you he was begotten of man and born of woman. He felt pain and brief joy as you do. Was he someone else? Was it not you yourself? What is this Self of yours? What was the necessary condition for making the thing conceived this time into you, just you and not someone else? What clearly intelligible scientific meaning can this \u2018someone else\u2019 really have? If she who is now your mother had cohabited with someone else and had a son by him, and your father had done likewise, would you have come to be? Or were you living in them, and in your father\u2019s father...thousands of years ago?

They don&#039;t sell products to consumers, they just print money, so they do not do layoffs in the same way that companies do.<br><br>2) Healthcare: This makes sense as during tough economic times, people die more. Therefore you have more work.<br><br>3) Finance: Tough financial times just means you need better financial managers so this adds up.<br><br>4) Consumer Staples: These are products that everyone needs/wants even during the toughest times. Could even include some luxury consumer goods if there is already an existing wealthy consumer base that will support it.<br><br>5) IT: Our world runs in tech so it makes sense that you need the people to still manage these systems.<br><br>If you work in one of these industries, or are somehow attached, you may be safer than others. However, there is one other rule to follow: do not be TOO specialized. For example, IT is one of the most recilient industries. That may seem weird when you look at the current wave of layoffs however you have to realize that the layoffs are mainly coming for highly skilled engineers that are simply not needed right now. There are just a limited amount of cutting-edge tech products to work on right now. However, the guy that simply maintains the database is still very much needed.

Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as &quot;algebraic objects&quot;. It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject.

Analysis can be thought of as studying the properties of topological spaces (basically a space with a fundamental structure; we only care about the properties preserved under &quot;continuous&quot; deformations like &quot;stretching&quot; and &quot;bending&quot; but without ripping it, or making any holes) with a notion of &quot;distance&quot; (metric), and especially the functions between such spaces. Within here there will include properties that one can study such as the &quot;volume&quot; (measure) of sets -- sets that are uglier and more complex than one might be accustomed to. Note I am being abstract here. Real Analysis and Complex analysis, deal with the spaces [math]\\mathbb{R}^n[/math] and [math]\\mathbb{C}^n[/math] respectively. <br>Calculus is then a set of tools derived from these fields, which are then applicable to real world problems. Here we have derivatives, integrals, how to solve them in various dimensions etc.<br>As for what books, it depends on your level of maturity. If you are familiar with the ideas of calculus and have a HS level understanding of mathematics, then you can probably move on to a Real Analysis book. I personally like Tao&#039;s and N.L. Carother&#039;s books on Real Analysis. Though perhaps brush up in set theory and the language and foundations of mathematics e.g. set theory, how to prove things, logic etc. a good book on this is called &quot;How to Prove it&quot;.", "time": 1676317953, "resto": 15192912}, {"no": 15200343, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:03:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15200318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15200318</a><br>Thanks anon.

In 1975 Collins voiced to Maynard Smith the view that natural selection could not drive evolution because it always acted to reduce variation in favour of an optimum type for any environment, whereas the central story of evolution was that of increasing variation and complexity. Collins quoted Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (&quot;... unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.&quot;), and argued that if variation must always occur before natural selection can act, then variation, and not natural selection, drives evolution. He asked Maynard Smith whether he could search for a &quot;strong&quot; theory of variation. Maynard Smith warned Collins that he could not support his efforts to pursue a rival theory to the theory that natural selection drives evolution. Collins replied that he thought the object of science was to question and examine everything, including hallowed theories such as the theory of natural selection. Maynard Smith asserted that, on the contrary, the strength of science was its capacity to agree on certain principles, and act collectively to pursue agreed aims.

Then the RNA in triplets is translated to proteins based on shape as recognised by the 20 tRNA molecules and sqeezed together by the ribosomes. The chain of amino acyds are folded based on hydrofobic nature and is kept in shape by that and sulfide bridges of cysteins. Proteins then preform the houseceeping functions of the cells as well as making any secretions, extracellular matrix componetns, determine cell shape, cell-cell interactions etc. Cell diffferentiation is determined by differing concentration gradients of secreted transcription factors such as the hox genes.

It is fundamental in magnetism and can be said manifest itself in a Quantum mechanical setting. (Moreover the existence of \u00c6ther is not contradicted by any form of physics). All things in existence are fundamentally in the form of waves. You may have heard this as the &quot;particle-wave duality.&quot; Except it&#039;s a little more nuanced. Fundamentally a &quot;particle&quot; is simply a wave packet in the \u00c6ther with special properties of which is it difficult to delineate at this time. However it would be reasonable in order to consider a wave packet a particle to require that it&#039;s expected energy is constant in the absence of other waves and a fairly static &quot;radius&quot; as [math] \\frac{E}{c^2} [/math] or another suitable expression can be used to define &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot; and the center of the sphere with the given radius as its &quot;position&quot; (even though these are uncertain experimentally and statistically within the quantum mechanical models). What I would assert is that the source of the magnetic field is the electron wave packet is a particle and has a special type of \u00c6theric oscillations (likely related to spin) which causes dynamic wave packets to form in the \u00c6ther around it which manifest in the usual notation as the particle travels through the \u00c6ther.

I will give three examples in which they appear:<br><br><br>1) Toric varieties: In many spaces you have &quot;global coordinates&quot; and the functions over the space can be understood in terms of them. This happens with affine spaces, projective spaces (homogeneous coordinates/polynomials), product of projective spaces (bi-homogeneous coordinates/polynomials),...<br>A very general notion of space with coordinate is given by the notion of Toric variety. For a semigroup S, this is the space in which functions are exactly elements on the semigroup-algebra k[S], that is, Spec k[S]. If S is generated by elements x,y,z,... then these elements are your &quot;coordinates&quot;. <br><br>2) Okounkov bodies: A big problem in algebraic geometry is to understand line bundles and their sections. The Riemann-Roch problem asks for understanding the sections H^0(X,L^n) for all the powers L^n of L. You can do this buy fixing a notion of order of vanishing on X (you can do this by fixing a flag of subvarieties on X and taking order of vanishings along the flag). Using this, you can see which order of vanishings appear on H^0(X,L^n) for different n. This list of vectors gives you a semigroup that depends only on L. You can recover all the intersection theory of L by doing geometry with this semigroup. (This is the theory of Okounkov-bodies and their mixed volumes).<br><br>3) Algebraic geometry of curves: Given a curve C and a point P on C, the Weierstrass semigroup of C at P is the set of all natural numbers k for which there exist a function regular outside P with a pole of order exactly k at P. It is an open problem to classify which semigroups can appear as the Weiestrass semigroup of a curve.", "time": 1676255229, "resto": 15196782}, {"no": 15199189, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)03:03:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15198696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15198696</a><br>Thank you for your comment anon, it was very informative.

As far as I understand it, these ideas are most often used in algebraic combinatorics, right?

Then, somehow, you can identify these results for different choices of [math](X_r)_{r} [/math]? <br>I&#039;m just guessing here, but maybe you study a divisor [math]D [/math] instead of a line bundle [math]L [/math], so that you always end up inside the Chow ring?

Normal toric varieties are determined by &quot;fans&quot; (a combinatorial object) and almost everything that you want to know about your variety can be translated to a combinatorial statements. As an example, the chow ring of a toric variety depends completely on its fan, so you get a definition of the chow group of a &quot;fan&quot;. You can extend this to consider the chow group of other combinatorial objects such as graphs, matroids or arbitrary &quot;tropical varieties&quot; and you arrive to the style of work developed by June Huh. I think that the Frobenius coin problem is a particular case of &quot;Chip-firing game&quot; on graphs, which is equivalent to computing the global sections of a tropical divisor on the graph.<br>But the origin of toric varieties where motivated purely by geometry.

For years, researchers had searched for something that caused the disease\u2019s telltale amyloid plaques \u2014 complex tangles of a protein called amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) frequently found in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. A series of studies published starting in the mid-2000s reported the discovery of a toxic form of A\u03b2 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer&#039;s disease called A\u03b2*56. Researchers hoped that A\u03b2*56 was the protein that snowballed into those amyloid plaques. But a team of sleuths found that many of the papers describing A\u03b2*56 were fraudulent and contained an array of faked images and blots. The fraud seemed to call the entire idea of amyloids causing Alzheimer\u2019s disease into question.</span>", "time": 1676158247, "resto": 15188384}, {"no": 15195375, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:37:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195356</a><br><br>MAN ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING.

You are presupposing that determined materialist event causation is the only form of causation.

So there is still a determination of events, it&#039;s just that AGENT causation is a variable instead. Reality is STATISTICAL and PROBABILISTIC fundamentally by the way. The things like the orbits of the planets with low uncertainty are are EFFECTIVELY deterministic since the probability distribution is as such that every cycle update the the random draw for an input will dictate that the planets stay on the course which is predictable to a high amout of decimal places but there is STILL some non-zero chance that a planet could tunnel from one side of the universe to the next, just as with quantum tunneling.

The company has made both solar cells and electricity transmission wires from simulated lunar soil -- a material that is chemically and mineralogically equivalent to lunar regolith. The engineering work is based on a process known as &quot;molten regolith electrolysis,&quot; and Blue Origin has advanced the state of the art for solar cell manufacturing. In this process, a direct electric current is applied to the simulated regolith at a high temperature, above 1,600-degrees Celsius. Through this electrolysis process, iron, silicon, and aluminum can be extracted from the lunar regolith. Blue Origin says it has produced silicon to more than 99.999 percent purity through molten regolith electrolysis.<br><br>The key advance made by Blue Alchemist is that its engineers and scientists have taken the byproducts of this reaction -- and these materials alone -- to fabricate solar cells as well as the protective glass cover that would allow them to survive a decade or longer on the lunar surface.

Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called formal theories. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms.

You can say it&#039;s related to the permittivity and permeability, but those are just two more constants. What makes them more fundamental than c? Nothing. It&#039;s also related to other constants like the fine structure constant. If the speed of light were different it would change a lot of things about the structure of the universe. In terms of fundamental physical laws, changing c is just changing a parameter. The effect is straightforward.

In either case, it is obvious that the problem with &quot;real numbers&quot; is that the foundation is rotten; if &quot;natural numbers&quot; are not well-defined, then neither are &quot;real numbers.&quot;", "time": 1676251140, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15198625, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:57:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15198507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15198507</a><br>If we use the long scale and accept novenonagintanongentilliard as the last word in the scale, then MOAN = (10^5999 - 1) * 10 + 9.", "time": 1676253457, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15200404, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bumo", "time": 1676319723, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15200538, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)16:13:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15198020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15198020</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A proper definition was never provided.</span><br>take your pick:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dedekind cuts</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;equivalence classes of cauchy sequences</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the unique ordered field with the least upper bound property</span>", "time": 1676322792, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15201081, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:32:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15198020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15198020</a><br>.99999999999999... = 1<br><br>seethe", "time": 1676334730, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15201095, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:36:39", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1665488349133095", "ext": ".png", "w": 764, "h": 769, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676334999597937, "time": 1676334999, "md5": "6psSfU2yQF97F2IlSDlr2Q==", "fsize": 1041407, "resto": 15198020}, {"no": 15201112, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)19:41:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "math is mental illness<br>nothing makes sense<br><br>shocking", "time": 1676335275, "resto": 15198020}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15187016, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:32:55", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ITT: /sci/ approved books", "filename": "pma", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 354, "h": 499, "tn_w": 177, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1675873975720584, "time": 1675873975, "md5": "bOAl8Kdx9eWl9yRKuDfzwg==", "fsize": 24288, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-sci-approved-books", "replies": 83, "images": 35, "unique_ips": 38}, {"no": 15187025, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:36:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;15187020</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not getting them off of libgen</span><br>ngmi", "time": 1675874163, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15187132, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)12:19:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187016</a><br>I prefer Apostols Mathematical Analysis book", "filename": "apostol", "ext": ".png", "w": 590, "h": 292, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1675876793466597, "time": 1675876793, "md5": "GurB5CHMeA9HqF0nPYfwvg==", "fsize": 40574, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15187342, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:21:18", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "cover", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1275, "h": 1651, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675884078554240, "time": 1675884078, "md5": "YlAwuann6XObCS+CSGX7Tw==", "fsize": 131062, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15187373, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:36:19", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "cover", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 551, "h": 800, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675884979083447, "time": 1675884979, "md5": "54KuT3AEoDIaQiekblor2A==", "fsize": 40199, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15187961, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:26:00", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "The Only QM book you need", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 260, "h": 400, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675902360143750, "time": 1675902360, "md5": "2W0i6cGbn/Zf+bSqmWYI9g==", "fsize": 15503, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15187975, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)19:29:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;15187965</span><br>Nah.

Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle. We can take any positive root and easily correlate it to some rotation in the complex plane.", "time": 1675649901, "resto": 15177129}, {"no": 15181161, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:29:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181147</a><br>Thanks.

What I just described are called &quot;complex numbers.&quot; They&#039;re analogous to a 2-dimensional plane and so can be thought of as &quot;2 dimensional&quot; numbers.

Because complex numbers fill up a plane, and specific numbers are analogous to various rotations, they encode rotation information numerically. This can actually be very useful to electrical engineers when trying to calculate the interaction of AC currents, since they&#039;re sinusoids with a phase. The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase. This is just vector math and doesn&#039;t require complex numbers, but depending on the situation, it can be easier to just multiply complex numbers by each other, rather than have to deal with angles and bust out the trig functions.<br>Quaternions can be used to calculate rotations in 3 dimensions, and are used in video games. Again, you don&#039;t HAVE to use them, but real-number implementations with vectors have certain ambiguities that can lead to certain glitches.

Most people think that Earth-like life is all about a suitable star, habitable zone, and a planet with the right mix of elements. It&#039;s so much more than that. The planet&#039;s core must be suitable to generate a field that protects the planet from solar wind etc. Greenhouse effect must be optimal to support life, but not too much to stifle it. And then, we humans would not be there if an optimally sized meteorite hadn&#039;t destroyed the previous, more primitive dominant creature of the planet. Not to mention that we have populated just the right places (tectonic activity) where our ancestors were forced down from the trees and thus, evolution happened to guide us toward a bigger brain future. Adding together all the happenstances, the probability of human-like life to appear elsewhere is pretty small. That said, it is possible that other life forms (e.g. dinos) could have evolved to intelligence eventually.

It also happened in the Americas, Asia, the Near East, and Europe. It was fine for small bands but larger societies permanently altered the landscape with it before transitioning to more productive farming techniques. Bronze Age Britain was even less forested than the UK today in part because of this.<br>Australian deserts also formed due to topography. The driest deserts on earth tend to form at 30 degrees north or south of the equator, which is where most of Australia is, but note Tasmania at 40 degrees south is much more temperate and forested. Combined with having a large inland space (Australia is roughly square) with much less mountains than say, the USA - and the fact that Indonesia gets much of the precipitation that might other fall - its really not surprising so much of Australia is desert.

Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

You can think of gravity as &quot;mass attracts mass&quot;. It&#039;s why the Earth is in orbit around the Sun and why apples fall to the ground.<br><br>-Plasma is a state of matter where the atoms are so hot that the atoms that make it up literally seperate. Most of the ordinary matter we see in the universe is plasma.<br><br>-At very high temperatures, like in the centers of stars, the particles that make up plasma start to behave very strangely. Protons adopt a special state, known as &quot;Volkoff spin&quot;.<br><br>-Volkoff spin isn&#039;t a very intuitive concept to grasp, but in essence it&#039;s consequence of proton hyperresonance in a charged non-Euclidean fluid. These effects were predicted by B. I. Karachensetov in the late 1990s, but they&#039;re are very hard to replicate in the laboratory. In theory, it&#039;s possible to approximate these effects by placing a tessellated Si-Ni-Co crystal under a running Hansen-Vogel field and reflecting any M-radiation emitted through an epsilon-concave surface and then feeding the spectrum through a computer analysis.<br><br>-Electrons in this state deform and rapidly switch between a 3-sphere a hypertorus topology, with a fractional-dimensional form somewhere in between. Surprisingly enough, electron charge doesn&#039;t have a complex Hegel value anywhere in this state.<br><br>-Electrons are very small particles of matter that surround the nucleus of the atom and carry negative charge. When electrical current flows, those are electrons moving.<br><br>There you are!

Children and younger adolescents aren&#039;t really as good at determining risk, they&#039;re physically far weaker, and susceptible to harmful situations because of their dependence on adults for survival. <br>Terrible things happen to innocent people. Something terrible happened to you. You have to look at those events at face value, see how they changed you, and learn what you can do to make yourself stronger as a result. You can&#039;t change the past. You can advocate for others that might share the same life events that you had, and help them escape their situations. You can help to protect them.<br>You&#039;ll be spinning plates until the world burns down around you trying to figure out the why&#039;s and the how&#039;s of your past.
