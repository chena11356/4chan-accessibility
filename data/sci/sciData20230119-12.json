The &quot;key&quot; here likely lies in all the endogenous retroviruses (and other assorted transposable elements) in the genome of the mice (which also applies to humans). Can &quot;blame evolution&quot; for that, these parasitic genetic elements have acted like an accelerator for adaption due to two core features: being highly mobile within the genome once activated (and if still intact enough to reintegrate) and usually carrying strong gene promoters (usually controlled by cellular stress). Problem being, these sequences are still in most cases &quot;parasitic junk&quot; and get epigenetically silenced by default. Now some of them however carry a feature which in the case of a DNA double strand break (so DNA stress roughly speaking) prevents the silencing of their sequence after the chromatin has been &quot;opened&quot; for repair (this btw does play an active role in the terminal differentiation of some cell types) ... keeping them perpetually active and potentially disrupting, triggering further &quot;control mechanisms&quot; within the cell like senescence or apoptosis which contribute to aging.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short. The seven-hundred year or thousand-year life-span to which some techies aspire[24] is nothing but a pipe-dream.</span>", "filename": "I TRIED TO WARN YOU", "ext": ".png", "w": 406, "h": 395, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1673927130171211, "time": 1673927130, "md5": "257HYnFqWBcHiyVxeoZntA==", "fsize": 143329, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130451, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)22:52:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129264</a><br>and you are going to browse /sci/ full of retarded conspiracies forever. why.", "time": 1673927533, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130525, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:34:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130426</a><br>It creates a lot of the same effects, it must mean something<br><br><a href=\"#p15130451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130451</a><br>because I&#039;m depressed and lost in life", "time": 1673930095, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130538, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:43:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129256</a><br>You know what would be funny?<br><br>God sees all this and makes the thing give you so much cancer and other side effects that your lifespan is cut to 5 years, while those that rejected the DNA change are rewarded with hundreds of years of life for being faithful.<br><br><a href=\"#p15129264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129264</a><br>I&#039;m already seeing how whoremongers and whores are giving themselves and their children incurable STIs like herpes and AIDS.

There is enormous power in having the ability to set prices for this type of technology (the same way they set prices for everything else). Let&#039;s say it&#039;s not a one and done thing, but rather something you need to have done on a regular basis. Maybe you need treatments annually. The elites are ALWAYS looking to implement slavery without the risk of backlash. This means designing systems, setting laws, and pricing things to keep you on a treadmill for whatever duration they choose. You could set the price of this treatment such that in order to receive it you would need to take out a loan and pay interest in effect...FOREVER. As long as you were receiving the treatments, you would need to be working to pay the loan to receive the treatments. <br><br>Every new treatment would require additional capital which would drain your funds and force you to continue to work. You could then further add more to this such as covenants about having a good tax record or clean criminal record, all of which could impact the interest rate you pay on it making the treatment either more affordable or less affordable. A lot of people would be living indefinitely, but this is like needing to work for someone for health insurance on steroids. You could even offer price-tiered treatments such that only billionaires could afford to maintain their age in their 20s, while working slobs could only ever afford to drop their age to their late 40s or early 50s. If they wanted to go to their 30s or 20s, they&#039;d essentially bankrupt themselves.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw <br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool. <br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673942251870097, "time": 1673942251, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "please keep the /sfg/ content in the /sfg/ thread", "time": 1673943506, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130884, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130848</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeorids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power. <br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him.

Events like TEDxMedical or TEDxSingapore took place, and initially the quality was near that of TED Talks.

I&#039;m less knowledgeable about the other topics, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s still a lot we don&#039;t know about these other subjects. For instance, in color vision we still don&#039;t know whether vision is best described by an opponent-process theory, a trichromatic theory, or some other theory. The point here being that we don&#039;t need to understand something perfectly in order to make useful practical progress within that domain. Prehistoric farmers and ancient Roman architects certainly didn&#039;t understand biology or Newtonian physics, but they were still able to invent agriculture and deisgn buildings that could stand for thousands of years. This is not a &quot;false equivalence&quot; as you claim. The point, once again, is that we don&#039;t need to fully understand a physical domain in order to make practical technological progress within that domain.

The question seems to involve the possible limits of rational inquiry or perhaps even of determinism and completeness of systems ala godel. On a personal level, the question tickles my fancy for its seems a way of priming the subconscious pump. Given the possibility space of some topic, including those questions which are &quot;just&quot; outside your awareness, actively engaging in free association I get the sense of &quot;firmness&quot; or &quot;relatedness&quot; of some grouping of associations. From here I might ask what types of answers those questions may submit and what forms they take, and interestingly a sense of distance from what I know. The feeling is literally one of tickling or feeling a pull in a certain direction and contining to allow your thoughts to churn round that kernel. This all seems just an instance of the creative process in general; fumbling around in the dark until the proverbial lightbulb turns on.

So, the relevance to your prompt could be the answer to the question, were you to receive a tool with no known purpose, to what extent would you appreiciate its usefulness or beauty? Would not the answer depend on how similar it is to what you already knew or could conjure from that possibility space? Is there some measure by which we could formalize when technology/ideas/forms proceed from the mundane to magic? Given the current and future state of AI, the question will need answering.

So here is what I&#039;ll do: define multiplication, and then, using induction, prove the properties you mentioned. The key idea is that when we say m * n, we mean &quot;the sum of n parcels equal to m&quot;. More precisely, for every natural number m, let [math]f_m: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}[/math] be defined as [math]f_m(p) = p + m[/math] so that [math]m \\cdot (n + 1) = (f_m)^n(m)[/math], where (f_m)^n is f_m iterated with itself n times. You might argue that this is just as arbitrary as the properties I am trying to prove, but I would disagree: the definition of m * (n + 1) is just the translation of &quot;the sum of n+1 parcels equal to m&quot; to the mathematical language. <br><br>Now with the definition of multiplication in mind, we see that [math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[\\math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]. This is really the heart of the first property. Now, the proof is as follows: let X be the set of natural numbers p such that (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p for every natural number m, n. I already have proved that 1 is in X above. Then, suppose p is in X, we will prove that (p+1) is also in X:<br><br>[math]\\begin{align}(m + n)\\cdot(p + 1)&amp;= (m+n)\\cdot p + (m +n) \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + n \\cdot p + m + n \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + m + n \\cdot p + n \\\\&amp;=m\\cdot(p+1)+n\\cdot(p+1) \\end{align}[/math]<br><br>There, I used the hypothesis that p is in X and the addition properties. We can conclude, by induction, that X = N. So we have just proved the first property. Oh fuck, I am not proving the second one, fuck it, but it just as easy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 80 iq retard</span>", "time": 1673916393, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130153, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130148</a><br>[math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[/math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]", "time": 1673916529, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130157, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are any of you guys like, professional mathematicians or have made a career out of math?<br>I kinda went NEET mode for 3 years...

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

One of those alternative services was to participate in scientific studies like the Minnesota Starvation Study. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A faction of the Civilian Public Service camps developed into a scientific research unit known as Camp #115, or the \u201cGuinea pig units.\u201d These units included around 500 conscientious objectors who volunteered to be scientific test subjects in a wide range of human medical experiments in the country\u2019s top universities and hospitals.[40] The majority of these experiments were conducted under the direction and approval of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Committee on Medical Research (CMR), and the Surgeon General at leading academic and medical institutions such as Harvard Medical School, Yale and Stanford Universities, and Massachusetts General Hospital. These experiments involved a range of research topics, including studying disease, survival in extreme conditions, and equipment testing. The experiments often endangered the health of the COs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minnesota Starvation Study was divided into four phases: A twelve-week baseline control phase; a 24-week starvation phase, causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of his pre-starvation body weight; and 2 recovery phases, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried.

An idealistic vision that sees humanity as a hypostatized species of its biome when, indeed, we are simply one of the incommensurable forms of sentient life randomly engendered, by nature, to be a vessel that carries around our genes. There is no intrinsic nature to life forms, we as homo sapiens, just like our simian, prehistoric ancestors, are just an ephemeral chapter in this slow and endless vortex of biomolecular mutations. Life struggle is to save itself through the species, but not the species itself (we wouldn&#039;t even be here now if that wasn&#039;t the case, since the demise of many species was imperative to the human dawn). There is no &quot;species&quot; to be saved, because every life forms is just a cycle in this infinite swirling of adaptations. Since adaptability is quintessential to survival, life ended up evolving into sapience with this self-consciousness (the illusion of existing as something other than a parasite trapped within our neurons, the deceptive idea of having an essential individuality or a soul) being only an unwanted epiphenomenon of intelligence. A man can do as he will, but not will as he will.<br>By acknowledging these facts, we already debunked the three major concerns about posthumanism (the need to save the species, to preserve the individual subjectivations and free will). The lasting matter would only be fear from the unknown: the conservative attachment to the configuration of current sapient living experience. As Ford said: If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. We can&#039;t appreciate precisely how life would be when experienced through a collective mind or through the lens of the synthesis of synthetic and organic life form, but what we do know is about our limitations that caused so much misery and suffering for hundreds of thousands of years without hope to break free from our congenital deficiencies.", "time": 1674047070, "resto": 15133563}, {"no": 15134055, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:12:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133563</a><br>Consciousness, the experiencer of the physical sensual data stream, is not a physical object (hence why it can&#039;t be objectively observed like a physical object can).

But when 90% of what he talks about is his CTMU it can make him seem a bit strange", "time": 1674011838, "resto": 15132298}, {"no": 15133220, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:18:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133214</a><br>Simple explanation w/ 160 IQ <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; suck it faggots</span>", "time": 1674011915, "resto": 15132298}, {"no": 15133239, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:29:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Woah!", "filename": "oy vey!", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1309, "h": 923, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1674012548457633, "time": 1674012548, "md5": "dVQ6GGMsGGoK9ce0FW4r4Q==", "fsize": 289967, "resto": 15132298}, {"no": 15133249, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133155</a><br><a href=\"#p15133159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133159</a><br>Everyone knows it can be gamed with thesaurus text deliberately intended to game it.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

The area that Aubrey works in gets very little funding. I&#039;m not certain if they get any from the government but I know a fair bit of it comes from donations, and that&#039;s why Aubrey has to travel around a lot speaking to try and raise awareness. Even if this anti ageing field received a few % of the total amount that goes into geriatric and cancer research that would be huge.

If you invented an organism that never aged, all the individuals would die from cancer eventually. <br><br>How fast your cells turn over (to repair injuries) determines your likelihood of getting cancer per year. More cell divisions = more chances to get cancer. But fewer cell divisions means slower or fewer types of repair. Humans don&#039;t regrow chopped off limbs because having that ability would confer more cancer than benefit. <br><br>Cells invented a way to make cancer rarer, which is to keep track of how many splits a cell line has done, and self-destruct if it goes over the limit. Every cell in your body essentially has a number of reproductions it can do which are going to last your whole life. Any group of cells that decides to reproduce uncontrollably will just hit the limit sooner and die without getting very large. In order for malignant cancer to happen, a single cell needs to randomly get two mutations at once: one to make it start splitting uncontrollably, and one to make it lose the self-destruct failsafe mechanism. This makes malignant cancer extremely rare compared to benign tumors (which happen constantly to everyone).<br><br>The natural lifespan is the result of an optimization of these variables: how fast do cells divide and how many times to we let them divide before they hit the limit and self-destruct.

That is because the cells that make offspring, spermatocytes and oocytes are part of the so called germline, a lineage of cells which separates early on, and is under far stricter regulation and control for DNA damage, and they don&#039;t devide all over the place (which is a core source of damage).<br>So these cell lines make or kids.

The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate. Abnormal ECGs were obtained in 51 (1.0%) of the students, of which 1 was diagnosed with mild myocarditis and another 4 were judged to have significant arrhythmia. None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously. Using these five students as a positive outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were 100% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac symptoms are common after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but the incidences of significant arrhythmias and myocarditis are only 0.1%. The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect but cost effect needs further discussed. What is Known: \u2022 The incidence of cardiac adverse effects was reported to be as high as 1.5 per 10 000 persons after the second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in the young male population based on the reporting system. What is New: \u2022 Through this mass ECG screening study after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine we found: (1) The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate; (2) the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%; (3) The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect.</span><br><br>I wonder why OP left this out?", "time": 1673756801, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125365, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>what&#039;s your point?", "time": 1673757512, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125389, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>meds.", "time": 1673758286, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125427, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but they&#039;ll be a lot less trusting.</span><br>that&#039;s a sign of intelligence. <br><br>Never trust authority figures.", "filename": "Joker World", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673759020239688, "time": 1673759020, "md5": "9U6pwGb5wPbnN+thWf9Fqg==", "fsize": 39430, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125432, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:05:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125197</a><br>kek!", "filename": "Vax Song", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1060, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673759122894624, "time": 1673759122, "md5": "bEbpEAOlMIE/YaOqG4V3Zw==", "fsize": 217959, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125365</a><br><a href=\"#p15125389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125389</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;17</span>% have cardiac symptoms guys!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously.</span><br>Cope.", "time": 1673761619, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125473, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically love the whole viruses aren&#039;t real gimmick and have been posting it a bunch everywhere.
