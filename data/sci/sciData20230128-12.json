Idk, all I do know is that your life becomes infinitely more meaningful if you live by the golden rule and BE A GOOD PERSON. After learning about Flat Earth I changed my life completely overnight.

That\u2019s why I try to bring others into the light about the heliocentric deception, bc it was the single most important revelation of my entire life. I\u2019m so grateful and just want others to have a chance at attaining this same feeling i now have. I\u2019m not trying to sound too grandiose but Flat Earth literally saved me from a lifetime of nihilism and apathy. Now I live my life as if every decision I make has meaning and purpose.

The molecules of the gas collide against each other depending on their energetic state. <br>2. Gravity pulls them to the bottom. <br><br>3. There is NOTHING &quot;sucking&quot; the air away. That is not what a vacuum is. <br><br>So depending on the energy or Temperature of the gas, the gas will expand out of the inner box, until it is at a density where it is no longer colliding with either the side of the vacuum containment, or with other gas molecules. At that point they settle to the bottom of the chamber, or stick to the sides, depending on what gas it is.

If the opposite is true, they will fall. This leads to a gradient that corresponds to the decreasing strength of the gravitational field.

Most likely your first customers will be mom n pop architect firms that need a mechanical designer for their plumbing and HVAC systems, simple stuff really, but it takes months if not years of persistence, pavement pounding, and unironically firm handshakes to get a client base. <br><br>t. licensed engineer w/ a freelance side hustle. if i wasn&#039;t making so much money at my day job i&#039;d do it full time. fuckin&#039; health insurance man.", "time": 1674786791, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156592, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:46:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15154116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15154116</a><br>how to transition from bachelors in neuroscience to career in zoology :)", "time": 1674787568, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156623, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:57:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15156592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15156592</a><br>eat caffeine pills, have a degree reassignment surgery and ask that people refer to you by your preferred credentials", "time": 1674788255, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156633, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15155170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15155170</a><br>If you have to ask whether to major in mathematics, then please don&#039;t.

The problem is that in complex systems not everybody that works on them understands how every other part of the system works, that&#039;s obviously impractical, so knowledge in a project is necessarily extremely fragmented and you need somebody whose job it is to make sure the system as an integrated whole meets the million requirements that go into any complex engineering project.

One reason is that having separate sexes can increase genetic diversity within a population, which can be beneficial for adapting to changing environmental conditions. Another reason is that having separate sexes can allow for the specialization of certain traits and behaviors that are beneficial for reproduction. For example, in many species, males have evolved to be larger and more aggressive than females in order to compete with other males for access to females. Female bodies are more specialized to invest more resources into reproduction than males do, such as by carrying and nourishing a developing fetus.

To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground.

(Melinda Gates, who focused the second half of the letter on gender equality, prefers Wheat Chex). He punctuates his letter with a simple mathematical equation he concocted that underscores the need for what he calls an \u201cenergy miracle\u201d.<br><br>P x S x E x C = CO2 (carbon dioxide output).<br><br>It\u2019s a neat little formula because it drives home the point: that for all the Paris climate talks and more affordable Teslas, environmental incrementalism is somewhat pointless. In the equation, P = population; S = services used by people; E= the energy needed to power those services; and C equals the carbon dioxide created by that energy. Population is of course trending ever-higher, as are the services people demand, especially in the developing world which has barely scratched the surface in terms of cars and air conditioning and other modern basics. Those two factors swamp progress in energy efficiency. Gates points out that scientists are calling for an 80 percent drop in carbon emissions by 2050 (and a total end by 2100) to stave off the most dramatic effects of climate change, yet even with more efficiency, the growth in population and services means that emissions will instead jump by 50%.<br><br>Math 101: the only way to get to zero carbon dioxide output is to drop one of those inputs to zero. Since eliminating any carbon byproduct of energy is preferable to a complete human die-off or a stone age suite of services, that\u2019s the only path. Shaving at the margins simply won\u2019t get the job done; only a moonshot solution that provides unlimited clean energy will stave off environmental (and thus, economic) catastrophe.<br><br>https://archive.md/yI8Zu", "filename": "FnfF07LWYAA49rJ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 798, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1674897339480741, "time": 1674897339, "md5": "8IWaTqW4B7naBpFObm8nEA==", "fsize": 87481, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "climate-change-is-over-pack-it-home-boys", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 15159526, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)04:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159523</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dysgenic depopulation shill releases predictable propaganda nugget to indoctrinate golem children in state prisons</span><br>BREAKING NEWS!", "time": 1674897440, "resto": 15159523}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15158552, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)16:57:11", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "neurological disorders of all ages", "com": "brain fog, visual snow, tinnitus, memory problems<br><br>why it happens to healthy unvaxxed people all of a sudden?<br><br>there is something bigger to this fact and it&#039;s ignored", "filename": "37a2fa7ed56cf5d1a166ddae877d94cf", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 711, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 246, "tim": 1674856631049972, "time": 1674856631, "md5": "vVRPscva0V7IMDMY3t9fIg==", "fsize": 56705, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "neurological-disorders-of-all-ages", "replies": 13, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 15158575, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:07:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158552</a><br>Oh, I have a least 5 of those....but I had them before covid", "time": 1674857277, "resto": 15158552}, {"no": 15158576, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:09:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158575</a><br>yes, havers berore the plandemic. what&#039;s causing this?", "time": 1674857359, "resto": 15158552}, {"no": 15158582, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:13:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158552</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why it happens to healthy unvaxxed people all of a sudden?</span><br>It isn&#039;t.", "time": 1674857627, "resto": 15158552}, {"no": 15158583, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:14:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158576</a><br>electrical field exposure?", "time": 1674857659, "resto": 15158552}, {"no": 15158602, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:23:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158576</a><br>4chan", "time": 1674858217, "resto": 15158552}, {"no": 15158625, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)17:35:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158552</a><br>I watch my diet very closely.

We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals.

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right. One must always take the smallest available size of a colour, but the larger sizes are obviously more powerful, so bank management is an important aspect of the game.<br>I found it via <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/catalog#s=bgg%2C\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/bgg,</a> and you can play it online on bga.", "time": 1674648904, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152201, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>Anything board game related with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; ?", "time": 1674649967, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152263, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)08:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Onions (japanese shitgames) can be found on <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a>", "time": 1674652296, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152372, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)09:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152201</a><br>Stratego?", "time": 1674656896, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152509, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>The different characters should have different shillouettes<br>If you disagree, you are contrarion.", "time": 1674663385, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152895, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144090</a><br>Which for humans, is always", "time": 1674675057, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15153740, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This game I invented called empty go.

In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board. This is done by pulling the twine taught above the board. In other words there must be a straight line connecting the piece to each side of the board for it to be defended. However, lines cannot pass through an enemy piece. During the maneuver phase place one piece on the board. You cannot play on top of or overlap another piece. Pieces can hang off the edge if the board as long as their center is on it. If you cannot place a piece, you lose.

Bacteria are like animals they&#039;re adapted to find a way to live in as many enviornments as they can but show strong preferences to certain ones. Most cells that make up your body are a type of defferentiated cells that are adapted to do a specific job or jobs in a specific area of the body which makes most of them unable to survive outside your body. When a cell that doesn&#039;t belong in that area be it your own cell or bacteria it causes problems.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are interesting discoveries about bacteria that only &quot;appear&quot; when arsenic poisoning is around.

Tree ring analysis indicates that as the material descended from space, it spewed large amounts of chemicals based on carbon and nitrogen into the stratosphere.

The &quot;emancipation&quot; of geometry don&#039;t cause the &quot;suppression of geometry&quot;, in fact wuite opposite. The translation of geometric problems to other fields of math, made a new renaissance for geometry, that spawned numerous (sub)fields that enable the solutions of otherwise impossible geometric problems. The creation of fields like algebraic geometry, analytic geometry, etc., enabled mathematicians to convert difficult to solve or even impossible problems through geometric paradigm, into say algebraic problem, and therefore solve it algebraically using it&#039;s algebraic logic. Vice versa also works, by converting algebraic problems into geometry and solving it using geometric logic. This enabled the flourishing of ! mathematics centuries later, see 20th hot field of algebraic geometry, which is useful in a lot of subject like cryptography that form the basis of all encryption for banking etc.", "time": 1674813824, "resto": 15156611}, {"no": 15157191, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:08:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157185</a><br>Low IQ take.

Consider the analogy of a computer: I&#039;m not sure how much you know about how computers work, but when you boot a computer and don&#039;t give it any more input from that point on, it will simply run deterministically based on its configuration (let&#039;s assume it&#039;s not connected to the web and won&#039;t take input from anywhere else either); that seems to be analogous to your deterministic conception of reality, with the initial cause being the initial configuration of the computer.

On the other hand, consider how you can give a computer input while it&#039;s on, non-deterministically altering its course of computation. This can occur on a continuous basis while the computer is on. This would essentially be the equivalent of having causes outside of the &quot;spacetime&quot; of the computer&#039;s computation, but on a running basis instead of just for the initial conditions. Of course, neither explains the same thing for reality as far as I can see, because whatever is causing the computation in the first place (the &quot;initial cause&quot; or the alterations to the computation (the &quot;choices&quot;) would still be left unexplained, and it&#039;s difficult to see how you could ever explain that without infinite regress.", "time": 1674854467, "resto": 15152171}, {"no": 15158855, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)19:10:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15158468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15158468</a><br>all theories must accept at least one brute fact. it is impossible to formulate a theory with zero assumptions. it is necessary to postulate an uncaused thing if one wishes to avoid infinite regress. the buck must surely stop somewhere. <br><br>i don&#039;t agree with the computer analogy. modifying a computer isn&#039;t analogous to having atemporal causes, because both the computer and any person operating it are within spacetime. there aren&#039;t separate spacetimes for the computers and for us, we are sharing a single spacetime. <br><br>it isn&#039;t a priori false to postulate that each human decision is its own uncaused, brute fact. but in addition to the problem of describing something with a beginning as uncaused, this would result in a theory with countless assumptions, one for each and every human decision. i also can&#039;t see how it would entail freedom of will, since every decision &quot;just is&quot;.", "time": 1674864638, "resto": 15152171}, {"no": 15158927, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)19:49:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152255</a><br>Demonstrably false, particularly if you only look at the educated", "time": 1674866971, "resto": 15152171}, {"no": 15159068, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)21:16:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152286</a><br>How about you get a tumor on your brain.

In such a prominent position, the wide spectrum of climate opinions is remarkable. Society has achieved a paradigm in which global warming subscribers and non-subscribers are largely segregated by political affiliation. Since science is non-political, only a misunderstanding of the science can facilitate such a segregation. In the first section we analyze a recent study by Cook et al. finding overwhelming scientific endorsement for the greenhouse theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). We find the popular reporting on Cook&#039;s result is not accurate. The aim of the following section is to clarify the science behind the most popular climate arguments and introduce the reader to some evidence that is not widely publicized. Even the astute non-climatologist should come away from this report with an enhanced understanding of relevant issues in modern climate science.", "filename": "TIMESAND___2bQrm72g85899i1qiKKJ79j4h8oJ3Qe2rj903knc0g181qf0De7j", "ext": ".png", "w": 826, "h": 1046, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674733139746209, "time": 1674733139, "md5": "7ifr8i8riPv4MqFaaQNOXw==", "fsize": 329515, "resto": 15154441}, {"no": 15154769, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15154757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15154757</a><br>Don&#039;t imagine.

According to scientists, this happens every seven decades as part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation. A new study suggests there may be a connection between the inner core&#039;s spin and life on Earth&#039;s surface, as changes in the core&#039;s spin coincide with changes in other geophysical observations such as the length of day and magnetic field.<br><br>The study, conducted by scientists at Peking University in China, found that the inner core is slowing down and reversing its rotation. The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the inner core&#039;s rotation slowed significantly beginning in 2009. The study also found that a larger, decade-long pattern may be at play, with the rotation of the inner core varying on a decade-long timescale and reversing course every 7 decades.<br><br>It is important to note that the inner core is a solid ball surrounded by a fluid outer core, which allows it to rotate at a different pace compared to the planet&#039;s outer layers. The study of the Earth&#039;s core is difficult and there is much disagreement over the interpretation of data. Scientists suggest that journalists can avoid inaccuracies by double-checking with scientists themselves.<br><br>Although the changes won&#039;t have much impact on life on the surface, more research is needed to understand the significance of the inner core&#039;s rotation on the planet&#039;s geophysical processes.", "time": 1674804160, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157052, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:54:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157026</a><br>thanks for bumping a dead popsci spam thread that nobody wanted to see again in order to show us a block of low iq text that nobody is going to read", "filename": "104 low iq", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 441, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674806099297995, "time": 1674806099, "md5": "hPy362RSSEZdiKEUyb15Sg==", "fsize": 170944, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157152, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:35:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15147911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15147911</a><br><br>Correct.
