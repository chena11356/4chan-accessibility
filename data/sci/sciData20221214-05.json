I prescribed a method for generating large numbers of strong attractors which could be used to overcome the Coulomb repulsion of like-charge protons. I specifically suggested passing protons near one another at relativistic velocities and that in the time these protons are in proximity, gluons would issue forth from the protons, potentially even interacting to become neutrons or better yet, odderons.

But you might as well ask what causes people to burn out of their jobs. PhDs vary hugely between countries, fields, groups and individual supervisors. Some PIs literally do not give a fuck if you don&#039;t do anything for a year, others micromanage every hour of your day. Both can be stressful. Personally, the workload wasn&#039;t that bad; at the end of the day, the bar for getting a PhD is pretty low. However, there is a far greater amount of things that you could/should be doing if you actually want to stand out among competition, to the extent that doing it all is simply not possible. There&#039;s publications, conferences, networking, teaching, outreach, research, getting funding, applying for positions, keeping up with literature, learning new shit, list goes on. And of course your work is made public and your output measured by metrics seen by anyone. So there&#039;s always something you should be doing that&#039;s knocking at the back of your head, and you&#039;re constantly comparing yourself to countless peers many of whom are just better.

We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

I assume this rank is reserved for the descendants of David, or something like that, which genetically excludes the people that run DB from ever taking control of the Knights of Malta. Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today.

Men could now experience the joys and challenges of pregnancy and childbirth as well. One man who was particularly excited to try his hand at fatherhood was former President Donald Trump.<br><br>Trump had always been known for his larger-than-life personality, and his pregnancy was no different. He made headlines everywhere with his frequent social media updates about the progress of his pregnancy, often making jokes and playful quips about the changes his body was undergoing.<br><br>As the due date approached, Trump began to feel more and more nervous. He had always been confident in his abilities, but the thought of giving birth was something completely new to him. But he needn&#039;t have worried, because on the big day, he successfully gave birth to a healthy baby boy.<br><br>The media was in a frenzy over the news, with reporters and photographers camped outside the hospital to get a glimpse of the new family. Trump was overjoyed, and couldn&#039;t wait to start his new life as a father.<br><br>Despite the initial excitement, however, Trump quickly found that being a parent was a lot harder than he had anticipated. He struggled to balance the demands of his new role with his busy schedule, and often found himself feeling overwhelmed.

It is best to be cautious when considering any method for penis enlargement, and to talk to a doctor before trying any new technique.</span><br><br>sorry anon", "time": 1670663534, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043031, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Screenshot_20221210-113337_Chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1079, "h": 1241, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670672043056322, "time": 1670672043, "md5": "xTnKtkYb90sb9HycNNxJ0g==", "fsize": 354072, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043049, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:53:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15038414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15038414</a><br>I was right all along", "time": 1670673189, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043212, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:01:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042593</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;holocaust is only about ovens</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;holocaust is about 6 million cremations </span><br>retard", "time": 1670684510, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043215, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Jew1", "ext": ".png", "w": 476, "h": 734, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670684646154112, "time": 1670684646, "md5": "qw72EBGt/zRPiCcXD5lwuw==", "fsize": 28977, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043223, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:10:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042663</a><br>Any of these<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Which activity has most noticeably improved your cognitive functions in adulthood?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how is dark matter and dark energy not ad hoc reasoning? why are these two ideas accepted by a practically all astrophysicists when on simple inspection it seems all they did was formulate a model to fit their observations?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do we really exist in a simulation?: What are the implications of that?</span>", "time": 1670685009, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043226, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15033730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15033730</a><br>It&#039;s just too easy", "time": 1670685176, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043245, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)10:20:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15033730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15033730</a><br>can it actually write like a 4ch poster in a lower effort style? can it make grammar errors and typos like your you&#039;re. so far whatever question i ask, the answers sound so canned, so dry, and its &quot;cadence&quot; is so robotically impeccable that it is obvious it is an AI.", "time": 1670685634, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043477, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)12:37:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15042867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15042867</a>", "time": 1670693850, "resto": 15031700}, {"no": 15043564, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)13:22:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve been trying to make ChatGPT reason within a formal language, but I&#039;m having little success.

The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

You didn&#039;t answer the question. I would like evidence that links specific brain cells to the creation of a specific thought or concept in a way that can be repeatedly demonstrated and for added bonus point, show how a completely different set of brain cells in two different people&#039;s heads can produce the same concept in two different minds to where we can know what one another are talking about, namely infinity in this case. Or, cut to the chase and tell me how a piece of objectively observable meat beams a non-objectively observable subjective experience into an observer. And explain why consciousness, if it is a physical object, can not be objectively observed as all other physical objects can be? What is the mechanism whereby this piece of meat actually transmits this non-material concept of infinity or any other concept to the experiencer?<br>point being pic related. Consciousness is not physical. Consciousness is made of consciousness, not brain or matter. Consciousness IS, because of a high level of immersion in the physical (virtual) world, constrained in certain ways by physicality that that can be observed and experienced neural correlatively, but that shouldn&#039;t be mistaken for consciousness being made of matter or it being a physical substance. So the number of cells in a physical (virtual) brain is irrelevant to what a mind can conceive of. In point of fact, brains, as is all other matter, are only ever observed as MENTAL OBJECTS in minds. And this by the way is why infinities are grounded in minds, not in the physical world. No infinities in the physical world, no continuities, no analyticity.

I build high power lasers and we&#039;re always trying to push the limits. When I get new material to build a laser, I can spend weeks grinding in a lab testing all of its characteristics, realizing some system doesn&#039;t work, figuring out why, modifying an optical system, etc. At some point we see what would be a useful experiment and focus on that to get some results for a conference/paper etc. Tasks can vary from machining, plumbing and vacuum system assembly to developing control algorithms, splicing fiber-optic components, working with vendors to get custom optics made, getting some custom electronics working, making cad models to get components made by a workshop, or just building a particularly complex optical system. Most of us can do a little bit of everything but we&#039;re not experts in anything. Sometimes some external collaborators show up for a few days with some system they want to test with the new/upgraded laser. If the experiment works out I might spend a few weeks not doing much lab work while I write or simulate. Then either continue adding on to the current system or start over with new stuff. Luckily I build lasers from scratch and don&#039;t usually have to rely on some student&#039;s experimental laser b/c they are rarely built for long-term operation. Occasionally I jump in on other peoples experiments when they need help. Every so often an administrator asks me to put together some slides, diagrams or a video to advertise our work, or even to give a presentation or lab tour to some VIPs. Then the admin tells me to get back in the lab and make them more money. two or three times a year I travel to a conference somewhere.<br><br>Have also worked in industry and a non-uni research institute.

The number six million, specifically, was showing up in numerous newspapers prior to WW2, back to around 1900, in articles and donation advertisements talking about the many starving semites in Eastern Europe and things of that nature. We&#039;re not talking two or three examples, but dozens of them across a variety of papers.

What has been a phenomenon however, is that high intelligence posters frequently crossboard, including activity on /pol/. We saw a heightened effort posting spectacle during Covid 19 where many autistic and gifted individuals were sharing their pertinent information anecdotal or referential to them at the time. From physicists to geneticists to engineers of all kinds, /pol/ saw major action from people deeply intertwined in the vaccination process or intimate knowledge of biology, mathematics, and general stem/med. It stands to reason from this activity that there was a validity to browse /pol/ to find new arguments being made on whether one should take a vaccine or refuse it, and how to protect one\u2019s self from Covid since the rest of the Internet implemented intense, authoritarian slave control of what could be posted by their users, bans were handed out like candy by anyone who was interested in real discussion. <br><br>Conclusion: /pol/ has a use case just like /sci/, that in when major happenings occur in the world, some intelligent people do find their ways to certain nefarious areas of the internet, and it is useful to engage or lurk for their opinions, even if it means wading through troughs of pure unfiltered shit.

Mine were shit, though almost 12 months of my studies were in and out of lockdown so a ton of online learning BS. If you have shitty work ethic and poor focus you will find it very difficult, if these attributes are somewhat decent, 121 is certainly adequate.

Most importantly, take what you&#039;ve learned and invent some small challenges for yourself which are meaningful to YOU. For instance, if you learn about number manipulation, loops etc in C - create simple challenges to code something for yourself: maybe you code a personal tax calculator, maybe you code a calorie counter, maybe you code a countdown timer for your virginity, idk. THIS GOES FOR EVERYTHING IN ENGINEERING, unless you&#039;re a total nerd and just love learning for it&#039;s own sake you need to find a way to make things appealing to you - which brings me to the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQe<wbr>PW6jJXsE<br><br>Because you&#039;re asking this question ITT, you&#039;ll probably do what I did and piss around trying to find the &#039;perfect&#039; beginer project or whatever.

For me, my earliest memories of wanting to be an engineer is watching movies like bourne and shit. I always wanted to work on military/spy/secret projects etc. So I always reference this when working on something. I also know that I&#039;m quite a neurotic/paranoid person and creative person, I know I&#039;m good at blowing holes through shitty security. How do these factors about my temperament affect engineering? Well, in the case of that vid link, what could this &#039;EMF eavesdropper&#039; be used for? Well, it&#039;s basically a bug sweeper, cool, seems useful, so I want to know how that thing works and possibly make it more powerful. Now, if I want to make a better one I&#039;m going to have to know stuff about the physics and math of EM waves and fields, flux, induction blah blah blah. All the while, knowing learning about EM waves is useful for other military/paranoid applications like one day I may want to build a HAM radio from scratch. I know learning about induction will also aid me when I learn about motors, which I&#039;ll need to know about for repairing a generator one day if SHTF. Just make it relevant to your nature and you&#039;ll be fine.<br><br>Also, if you ever get into high voltage projects. Watch the whole fucking video and pay attention. If you start pulling apart TV&#039;s or microwaves you could quite literally kill yourself.

Unfortunately, it cost $190 million per flight in 1990&#039;s money which made it DOA as a commercial offering. The main goal of the H-IIA was to cut that cost in half to $90 million, which it did, and the H-IIA had twenty successful years as a domestic launcher, even if it didn&#039;t have any commercial success abroad.

When we are taking the n dimensional Hausdorff measure in n-dimensional Euclidean space, it equals the Lebesgue measure, so for the time you can think of it as an &quot;extended&quot; Lebesgue measure.

Here, we&#039;ll let [math]g \\equiv 1[/math] and [math]u:(x, y, z) \\mapsto z[/math] be the projection onto the z-axis.

Therefore, the expression [eqn]\\int_\\Omega g(x) |\\nabla u(x)| dx = \\int_\\Omega dx[/eqn] is going to lend for us the volume of this cone. The coarea formula allows us to rewrite this integral in terms of the level sets of u.

The radius of this disk is given by [eqn]r_t = \\frac{R(h - t)}{h}[/eqn] Then, the inner integral is simply going to produce the area of such a disk, and the integral over R will be replaced with the integral from 0 to the height of the cone.

Most of the anti-frog sprays used on things like eyeglasses incorporate hydrophilic (water-attracting) molecules. These draw in and evenly dispense condensation, making it easier to see through. By contrast, your car&#039;s rear window uses integrated elements to heat the glass, keeping condensation from forming in the first place.<br><br>Developed by a team at the ETH Zurich research institute, the new coating likewise uses heat -- but it doesn&#039;t require electricity. Instead, it uses a layer of clustered gold nanoparticles, sandwiched between two ultra-thin layers of titanium oxide -- the whole coating is just 10 nanometers thick, which is about one twelfth the thickness of a sheet of gold leaf. The gold nanoparticles absorb much of the infrared spectrum of incoming sunlight, causing the coating to become up to 8 degrees Celsius warmer than the ambient temperature. That said, the nanoparticles absorb very little visible light, allowing the coating to stay transparent. The refractive properties of the titanium oxide boost the efficiency of the heating effect. Additionally, the outer layer helps protect the gold from wear and tear. And as an added bonus, because the gold layer is electrically conductive, a power source such as a battery could be used to heat the coating when direct sunlight isn&#039;t an option.", "filename": "nyquil", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 632, "h": 483, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 191, "tim": 1670940733649096, "time": 1670940733, "md5": "W3daOE03NBIdV1cz50JBmw==", "fsize": 89382, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "golden-antifrog-heater-by-the-french-speakers", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 15051432, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)16:33:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15050403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15050403</a><br>That&#039;s a waste of good chicken and dxm (both essential components of diet) :(", "time": 1670967211, "resto": 15050403}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15051404, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)16:22:04", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Irish Medbros, I need your advice.", "com": "I started studying medicine in Galway this year.
