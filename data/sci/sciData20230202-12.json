Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

The drones are ejected and then rapidly decelerate, assuming a stationary position angularly offset from the true position of the missile. The CIWS-defeating missile visually acquires the exact physical position of the CIWS batteries on the enemy ship, placing their three-dimensional coordinates on a virtual battle grid. The CIWS-defeating missile remains in constant contact with the decoy drones, relaying this information and enabling them to properly direct conical beams of extremely intense IR light toward the specific CIWS platform it is tasked to spoof. The LASERs do not need to have high endurance since they only need to distract the CIWS&#039; attention for a few seconds and the drones themselves are disposable.<br><br>The decoys each pick a different CIWS and use the targeting data to decide where to focus a special beam of light that is essentially conical, heating the atmosphere dramatically in what would look to the CIWS to be a halo.

The key observation is that if you have a bit that sticks out horizontally, you can get rid of it by extending the bit it&#039;s sticking out of vertically by the same amount, without changing the perimeter. So you divide the shape into two parts like in picrel, then you calculate the perimeter of the part on the left: you take the bits that stick out by 3, 2, 3 units, get rid of them, extend the &quot;column&quot; they&#039;re attached to by (3+2+3)=8 units, leaving you with a vertically flipped L with a height of 16 units and a top edge of 4. That&#039;s a parimeter of (16+4)*2=40. Now you have the part on the right. If you ignore the hole on the bottom and treat it like another L shape, you get a parimeter of (4+7)*2=22. Suppose the height of that hole on the bottom is x; then the calculation is short by 2x. However, treating the two parts as separate and adding their perimeters overshoots the real perimeter by adding the length of that shared bit twice, i.e. it overshoots by 2x, so it cancels out. 40+22=62, or in other words: (8+4+3+2+3+4+7)*2=62.

I take Latuda and Desyrel as sleep medication. If I don&#039;t sleep for a few days I start to hallucinate and my brain shuts down and I can only walk, jump, sit etc. and give minor descriptions and my ability to communicate my thoughts to other people becomes extremely limited. While on Latuda I noticed that I can&#039;t just take it with milk, unless I have eaten a Normal plate of food soon enough. Desyrel (trazodone) increases the quality of my mood, usually at night when sometimes I have planned to sleep and listen to mp3 music without becoming easily depressed. Doing push ups certainly helps. Since I started doing push ups and compared to when I was last doing a very high number of them (about 500,000 a day really fast in about 1.5 hours) I think the medication is best on 1. Normal plate of food AND exercise 2. Planning 3. No logistical compromises.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients. This is because patients with undetected infections would be unlikely to be reinfected when testing availability expanded later during our study period. Second, our measure of COVID-19 ending in death within 30-days could also be inaccurate because we did not have access to death certificate data to confirm the actual cause of death. However, many deaths immediately following COVID-19 infection are likely to be at least partially related.<br><br>The availability of vitamin D3 without a prescription also limits our ability to ensure we have fully categorized dosage and supplementation intensity.&quot;<br><br>they bent data, made assumptions and didn&#039;t actually find any significant difference.", "time": 1675236284, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>I looked in the astroturfed zinc and quercitin recommendation to prevent covid.<br>It is all the same.<br>Does nothing and is potentially toxic.", "time": 1675271931, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169874, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>Thoughts on taking 10,000 IU vitamin D daily?

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50.

Even European countries lack rigorous monitoring, and Africa&#039;s interior temperature is completely reliant on model-created data.<br><br>Your argument is built on so many lies that it&#039;s impossible for you to negotiate the maze and give a single, straightforward answer to any question.", "time": 1675218748, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168444, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br>If you can\u2019t tell the difference between regional sea level that\u2019s influenced by erosion and tectonics and global sea level rise then why are you posting your baseless opinions?", "filename": "09747C1C-F7A7-4156-8221-4E4DB5D2CEE7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 915, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675218795099648, "time": 1675218795, "md5": "mn9uBPzC4MK38T6q/O08AA==", "fsize": 84712, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168450, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168444</a><br>Climate soientists don&#039;t seem to be able to tell the difference so it&#039;s right to call them out for their nonsense.", "time": 1675218897, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168451, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:35:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know about tides</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know that one random building doesn&#039;t reflect the world</span>", "time": 1675218916, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168452, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:35:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br>i&#039;m the anon who posted that graph. the satellite data is correct because it only shows a few millimeters (couple centimeters, at most) of increased sea level on average. key word: on average.", "time": 1675218952, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168458, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168444</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are two sea levels!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newton was wrong, gravity is woke and binary now!</span>", "filename": "hahaha", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675219220611933, "time": 1675219220, "md5": "ypxAGRlvvaBQI4O/Tm99LA==", "fsize": 14133, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168459, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168450</a><br>I wonder why sea level rise is documented with global sea level altimetry instead of with pictures <br><a href=\"#p15168440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168440</a><br>Again complete ignorance or willful lying.

That&#039;s a recipe for disaster. If any of the air purifiers or vacuum pumps fails, it&#039;ll completely ruin a whole batch of chips until someone figures out what happened. And one WILL fail, because the dust particles will stick to any metal object, like vacuum pumps, air purifiers, and chips. (And due to low atmospheric pressure, they&#039;ll also stay in the air longer.)<br><br>Third - Due to the electrostatic dust, anyone needs to come into the cleanroom, they&#039;ll need to go through a TON of prep procedures - at minimum, removing their spacesuit, going through an air shower, changing their clothes, and then putting on another spacesuit for the carbon-dioxide heavy air in the cleanroom.<br><br><br>The only thing that&#039;d be economically useful about Mars is getting precious metals.

The presence of large quantities of proteins which act a bit like anti-freeze in these special cells mean that preservation of these particular cells by freezing is possible.

Ordinarily, hydrogens in water tend to be liganded at an orientation of 104.45\u00b0 of angle relative to their associated oxygens.

Since 2017, it has been understood that senescent cells feature a wrinking of the nuclear membrane, but it is not known to the scientific community what causes this wrinkling.", "time": 1675232446, "resto": 15168878, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15168882, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:21:49", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "If these covalent bonds are based upon; at the most fundamental level; the repulsion of electrons and other electrons, then the forces at work are fundamentally the same as in the case of whole molecules locked into a lattice in the case of frozen water.

If DNA attempts to pass through such a membrane at a point in that proverbial chain link fence where a link is missing a hydrogen, the fence will not perform its task of allowing the transport of the DNA, slowing the healing process and further damaging the membrane in one fell swoop. Once damaged in this manner, the membrane appears under a microscope to be wrinkled and the cell is therefore considered senescent.", "time": 1675232509, "resto": 15168878, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15168883, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:22:56", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "Senescent cells are capable of spawning new cells, but these cells are generally also senescent and this process is generally slower than healthy cell replication since attempts to pass DNA through corrupted sections of nuclear membrane necessitate that part of the genetic code of the new cell be re-encoded and re-transmitted repeatedly until a healthy section of membrane is selected by chance and the process may be completed in its entirety. Since senescent cells must copy their own DNA to facilitate replication about 5x as often as healthy cells, in this author&#039;s view, the paradox of senescent cells&#039; higher risk of carcinogenesis despite a slower apparent rate of replication can be explained by this higher level of activity in the nucleus.<br><br>Recent experimental therapies have purportedly been effective in reversing cell senescence. I would propose that the as-yet unknown mechanism underpinning these treatments must fundamentally work by introducing free hydrogen ions to the nuclear membrane with those hydrogens linking up with hydrogen monoxides and restoring them to their original status as standard water. These therapies, although promising, are incomplete, both because the wrinkling of the nuclear membranes would not be entirely &quot;ironed out&quot; by rehydrogenization alone and because aging is a multifaceted process. The other major component of aging is systemic waste protein buildup secondary to the kidneys reaching their fundamental limit for storage of these proteins, as described in a previous publication by this author.<br><br>This hypothesis is consistent with what is already understood with regard to psychological and physiological stress as it relates to aging.
