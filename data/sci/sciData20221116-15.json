Consequently, advanced alien civilizations may have incentives to avoid space colonization to avoid taking up too much \u201ccalculating space\u201d and forcing a simulation shutdown. A possible solution to the Fermi Paradox is that analogous considerations may drive them to avoid broadcasting their presence to the cosmos, and to attempt to destroy or permanently cripple emerging civilizations on sight. This game-theoretical equilibrium could be interpreted as the \u201ckatechon\u201d \u2013 that which withholds eschaton \u2013 doom, oblivion, the end of the world. The resulting state of mutually assured xenocide would result in a dark, seemingly empty universe intermittently populated by small, isolationist \u201chermit\u201d civilizations.</span>", "filename": "doomed-earth-600x380", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 380, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1668628614978883, "time": 1668628614, "md5": "N8SlQriYM4XpO+YS3YvTgg==", "fsize": 16979, "resto": 14985884}, {"no": 14992213, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:02:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14985884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14985884</a><br>The faggot known as OP", "time": 1668628979, "resto": 14985884}, {"no": 14992381, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14985884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14985884</a><br>There are no arguments other than we haven&#039;t found any.<br><br>Searching for intelligent life is literally like trying to find a needle in a 93 billion lightyear observable sized haystack.", "time": 1668631992, "resto": 14985884}], "last_modified": 1668631992}, {"no": 14992061, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:53:15", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Digital Dark Ages 2.0", "com": "How they bullshit it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh floppy discs I can not access my floppy discs. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I literally can not insert muh floppy discs into my PC</span><br><br>The solution<br>Her here is a converter USB to floppy disc.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh thanks problem solved</span><br><br>This is the retardation of the digital dark age 1.0<br><br>How it will actually look like.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Facebook/google/whatever deletes 100s of videos and pictures. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Books made for digital only are deleted over time.</span><br>Saving is illegal<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Games who are made for online only basically rot away as they are updated with new crap and change.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Servers for game go down game basically becomes dead.</span><br><br>This is the digital dark age (2.0).<br><br>Also<br><br>Store family photos on a HDD.

Less than the two hours after launch, the upper stage will fire one last time to send Orion on a path toward the moon. On Monday, Orion will pass within 60 miles of the moon&#039;s surface.

Productivity is generally measured across whole industries or economy-wide. In a real production function, the marginal product of an hour of labor varies across the production schedule, and with the quantity of labor and capital inputs. The actual marginal revenue for a good varies with the cost of these inputs and demand/supply for the good, so these are always moving targets. The problem with all the two way graphs is that they try to hold things constant that aren&#039;t.<br><br>Firms produce where marginal revenue = marginal cost (where productivity would be a price ceiling) only in perfectly competitive markets, which don&#039;t actually exist, or in perfect unregulated monopolies with perfect production function and demand curve information, which also don&#039;t exist.

Also the rapid development of capital in developing countries and the entry of women into the workforce in much larger numbers, which dramatically expanded the labor supply. Huge increases in supply + easier substitution made the demand for labor more elastic while also ramping up supply.<br><br>The theory is just wrong.
