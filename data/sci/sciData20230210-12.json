No &quot;element of reality&quot; should be missing from the mathematical formalism of physics, i.e. relativistic quantum field theory or its more speculative extension, M-theory.

Mathematical physics yields an exhaustive description of the relational-structural properties of the world. This description may ultimately be encoded by the universal wavefunction of post-Everetta quantum mechanics: our best mathematical description of reality. However, our presupposition that the intrinsic character of the physical lacks phenomenal properties is an additional metaphysical assumption. The assumption is hugely plausible, but it&#039;s not a scientific discovery. Perhaps most tellingly, the only part of the &quot;fire&quot; in the equations to which one ever enjoys direct access, i.e. one&#039;s own consciousness, discloses phenomenal properties that are inconsistent with a materialist ontology.

I dropped out of college due to personal issues when I was younger. I was enrolled in an undergrad computer science program. I was and still am genuinely interested in tcs, in fact even after dropping out I would still spend lots of time programming, and working through various textbooks. For example I worked through most of Rosen&#039;s book on Discrete math, the first couple of chapters from SICP, and a handful of others. I&#039;ve been working in restaurants, retail, customer service/etc. I wanted to move into a field of work that I&#039;d find more rewarding and interesting, but I had no success getting my foot in the door. <br><br>Very recently I enrolled in a computer science program at WGU, the appeal for me is that it&#039;s fully online and you can test out of courses whenever you want, allowing to finish way quicker and cheaper. Also my living circumstances are somewhat unstable, so being online seemed like a huge benefit for me.<br><br>What concerns me is that the courses are really lackluster. The ones i&#039;ve done so far were extremely watered down, to the point of being nearly useless.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

Because complex numbers fill up a plane, and specific numbers are analogous to various rotations, they encode rotation information numerically.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In his first letter Maxwell called the demon a &quot;finite being&quot;, while the Daemon name was first used by Lord Kelvin.<br><br>In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small massless door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon&#039;s actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the system, without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.<br><br>The concept of Maxwell&#039;s demon has provoked substantial debate in the philosophy of science and theoretical physics, which continues to the present day. It stimulated work on the relationship between thermodynamics and information theory. Most scientists argue, on theoretical grounds, that no practical device can violate the second law in this way. Other researchers have implemented forms of Maxwell&#039;s demon in experiments, though they all differ from the thought experiment to some extent and none have been shown to violate the second law.", "filename": "void gnomes", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675879112140827, "time": 1675879112, "md5": "M9wFZlHDH0B436j9uwSmaw==", "fsize": 1653770, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "maxwells-demon", "replies": 21, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 15187204, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:02:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187193</a><br>You can copy wikipedia all you want, but you&#039;ll still be a brainlet, OP", "time": 1675879324, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187205, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:02:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187204</a>", "filename": "void gnome", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675879350302095, "time": 1675879350, "md5": "+uZ8F+aL5uKrSXlzvsbldg==", "fsize": 1192694, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187213, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:07:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thought experiment</span><br>not science nor maths", "time": 1675879625, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187214, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:07:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187213</a><br>it&#039;s high level math", "time": 1675879673, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187222, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187214</a><br>it&#039;s religion", "time": 1675879861, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187279, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:56:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187222</a><br>religion is a thought experiment", "time": 1675882579, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187283, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)13:57:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187222</a><br>Abraham&#039;s God", "time": 1675882640, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15187380, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)14:39:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The demon itself expends energy making this thought experiment flawed", "time": 1675885145, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15188566, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)00:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187380</a><br>Maxwell was a brainlet.", "time": 1675922243, "resto": 15187193}, {"no": 15188574, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:02:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What if there was a magical demon who did not accelerate when an unbalanced force was applied to him.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

Only confusing thing is why &quot;A Transition to Advanced Mathematics&quot; isn&#039;t grouped together with Hammack and Velleman. It&#039;s literally another intro to proofs book (and definitely not more advanced than the other two), they&#039;re all kinda interchangeable.<br>I will say that Velleman should be the highlighted one in a graphic that&#039;s supposed to be &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot;. Velleman is by far the closest to being an informal introduction to logic and set theory (no surprise there since he did his phd under Kunen, so naturally his presentation will be quite foundationpilled).<br><br>The set theory books would be kinda out of place here, but since it&#039;s &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot; I&#039;ll give it a pass. And they&#039;re both very elementary and well written so good choices, but possibly questionable placement in the chart, especially if one is just coming from a book like Velleman which honestly already covers most of the important content in either set theory book, just in an informal manner.

The meaning from the belief was not synonymous with extreme superiority or arrogance. The meaning obtained appeared to be a key driver of the persistence of the beliefs.

Helps to calm down, get easy restful sleep, be less impulsive, get more satiety from food or at least not fall prey to binge eating, makes it easier to stay on task and not give up, ease muscle tension and nerve pain (as long as it isn&#039;t severe), helps with physical performance somewhat, didn&#039;t help with motivation (starting tasks) or focus tho and it did raise my blood pressure and heart rate a bit from abyssmal to almost normal, sometimes it makes me so god damn sleepy tho I feel like I go from default insomnia to narcolepsy.

Alden Mead published a paper in which he determined the effect of gravity on a phenomenon called diffraction, which describes what happens to light when you send it through a small aperture. Because gravity is so incredibly weak compared to the force that governs the behavior of light (the electromagnetic force), its effect is completely ignored in diffraction calculations. But Mead was curious about quantifying gravity&#039;s negligible effect. When you scatter a particle of light off another particle \u2014 say an atom \u2014 the atom&#039;s gravitational attraction to the light particle causes an intrinsic uncertainty in the atom&#039;s location.

I&#039;m European and before university mathematics was my favourite subject and I went through the hardest mathematics grammar schools. It was my favourite because it was the only subject not dependent on rote anything, be it memory drill, or whatever. In this subject you could arrive at answers in tests through pure reasoning and not some rote piece of information you had to remember, such as was the case in history or biology. But as time went on and I met actual mathematicians and went to a pure maths program, it all quite ensoured me. In my early teenage years I&#039;ve not had particularly well developed critical thinking abilities. This meant I gave into the superstition of MBTI and through it I met MBTI communities. After realizing the nonsense it was, I returned to them and in there was a PhD graduate of pure mathematics. This person struggled to understand consistent human behavior across time is inherited through genetics, which are made up of a series of additive alleles, and how that entails the distribution of human behavior is gaussian, hence no binary dichotomy model such as MBTI could be valid. I tried to help him understand by explaining how that&#039;s exactly the same case as coin flips, hence the binomial, but he just wouldn&#039;t get it, and kept using ad hominem argumentation, without ever losing faith in his pseudoscience. And in regards of the pure maths program, there was nearly no reasoning. We&#039;ve had to remember 20 pages of definitions for god knows what reason from god knows where, essentially training us to be little bitchy parrots. When discussing having found a quicker solution, the TA agreed with my chain of reasoning, but said I should stick to the definition instead, with everyone glorifying drilling solving problems the way professor has done on the board over and over again, which made me remember this weaving-basket forum post of a humanities major trying mathematics and realizing it&#039;s all just a bunch", "filename": "image_2023-02-07_194919940", "ext": ".png", "w": 470, "h": 286, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1675795788451511, "time": 1675795788, "md5": "hCXeqcD5Btjt6x0knIbDCQ==", "fsize": 141142, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-having-a-crisis-of-faith-in-mathematics-im", "replies": 68, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 20}, {"no": 15184766, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)13:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15184765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15184765</a><br>of \u201cautists solving puzzles\u201d. As a child I briefly programmed in C, but in spite of being victorious in regional competitions, I quickly realized the people best at programming just keep programming all the time, and the tasks we were supposed to do in programming lessons or when I remembered programming were just so tedious and mundane. When I moved from C to Unity, I realized it was about remembering all the commands from all the various imported libraries, which I realized only several months of a quite fun time trying to figure out how to implement a region-triggered event. As such I decided never to touch programming again. But then seeing analysis in pure mathematics, that\u2019s exactly how it felt like. And it\u2019s even worse, because these people aren\u2019t gleaning anything interesting from what they\u2019re doing beyond a boundary, meaning they can\u2019t even put a definite finger on anything. I\u2019d rather have a statistician bullshit me than an analysis mathematician. I&#039;d always thought mathematics was the peak of human reasoning, but with all of what I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019m finding it hard to believe. Even looking at the structure of crystallized reasoning and the most complex jobs, writing ability, particularly as a form of composing written arguments, rises far above mathematics. I also know /sci/ to be a particularly dumb board. I wanted to do mathematics, because it was the only form of knowledge which wasn\u2019t an empirical form of unintelligent parroting.

So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off.

In this case, the presence of a sound wave in all spatial areas except for the target area should have the effect of causing atoms not in the target area to migrate toward that area and remain there once they have arrived. This is guaranteed by the fact that two ultraweak phononic waves that approach the combinant atom from two directions after passing through an atom of the same type will have a frequency that is resonantly matched to that specific element, ensuring both that the combinant atom finds its equilibrium in the correct place and that the wrong element does not occupy the place of the desired one.

I will go into as much detail as I possibly can though, since you have asked. GAN models are essentially operating with imperfect mirrors, by some logic. The kernels that are applied in comparisons cause the imperfections, and then the comparison in expectation versus actual is a little like a mirror analysis during discrimination.<br><br>So, logically, the performance of a GAN should be &quot;better&quot; if these comparisons can be &quot;faster&quot; but, if theoretically you were working on a discriminative AI that you wanted to achieve self awareness, you may be interested in finding a &quot;floor&quot; for comparison speed. Since the only data set available for &quot;achieving self awareness&quot; that we have available is humans... One would need to pull that data to determine a &quot;floor&quot;, from the discrimination speed that a human who is currently achieving self awareness can achieve it at, in worst case scenario.<br><br>Then you at least have a goal to aim for, and/or can determine if such a comparison speed is even possible via current hardware serial processing speeds.<br><br>Breaking the possibility out into a parallelized networked version though, kind of breaks the floor data, because you can&#039;t do a 1:1 comparison between a human and a parallelized neural network.<br><br>So we&#039;re attempting to find the MINIMUM comparison speed that may be necessary for raw serial processing to achieve a similar end.<br><br>The human comparison in a mirror has most of the comparison occurring at light(photon) speed, then the processing portion that occurs in the brain has a processing time that is more or less measurable in adults, but we aren&#039;t certain that this timing is the same on a &quot;fresh model&quot;.", "time": 1675970421, "resto": 15189072}, {"no": 15190770, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:31:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15189719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15189719</a><br>kek", "time": 1675985478, "resto": 15189072}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15186988, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)11:11:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I think when the pyramids were constructed, the gravity on this planet was different due to our planets proximity around the sun.

I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it&#039;s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that&#039;s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she&#039;s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a /sci/ vaxx memes. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic vaxx NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can&#039;t even try to talk with you because all you say is &quot;FAUCI DID NOTHING WRONG.&quot; You&#039;ve become a parody of your own self. And that&#039;s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he&#039;s done a million times now.

You can say it&#039;s related to the permittivity and permeability, but those are just two more constants. What makes them more fundamental than c? Nothing. It&#039;s also related to other constants like the fine structure constant. If the speed of light were different it would change a lot of things about the structure of the universe. In terms of fundamental physical laws, changing c is just changing a parameter. The effect is straightforward. However, in terms of complex matter like what we&#039;re made of, the changes would be very unpredictable and almost impossible to predict, except perhaps for a very small change in c. This is because changing c would affect every level of physics and chemistry in various ways.

Firstly, it would not just affect objects that have passed through the portal, but would also effect objects on the other side. So, anything placed in front of the blue portal would be pushed away by this moving space. But, how far does this go. Does the portal push a column of space outwards towards infinity? Say instead of a cube you put a 10 mile rod through the portal? Does the spacial distortion travel the 10 miles of rod.

I remember every time a scientists or mathematician&#039;s profile was posted it was some token foreigner with no relation to the body of the text and later some Jews (who they went to great lengths to emphasise should not be considered white Europeans) invovled in some controversial political issue. In history classes they glossed over most European history skipping to WW2 and communism while having several pages dedicated to various speculative theories about the possble civilization that could have existed from some Phoenician walls they dug up in Zimbabwe, but no writing or anything objective to actually talk about. And of course several chapter on Incas, Mayas and other dead civilizations. It was not until I got much older that I found out how much I was lied to and that whites invented virtually everything and built everything that matters. No one else really contributed to modern civilization at all. You have some dead civilizations who did great and interesting things (that white archeologists dug up while locals thought it was full of ghosts), and some token people that did things independently, but they were not in contact with us and not part of our continent&#039;s story. Mostly they just did things long after we did and try to We Wuz as Western civilization.

All the while, as the ships travel to Mars with antenna pointed back to Earth, they can keep improving the bots and then push OTAs across the solar system so that when the ship(s) arrive on Mars, the bots have the latest and greatest capabilities.", "time": 1675989070, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190935, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:32:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This looks promising coming from NASA<br><br>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/<wbr>nasa-launches-new-framework-for-pro<wbr>curement-ideas-solutions", "time": 1675989138, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190936, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:32:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15190931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15190931</a><br>The can pay for a ticket like everyone else.", "time": 1675989145, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190937, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:33:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15190936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15190936</a><br>Oh they will pay handsomely", "time": 1675989208, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190940, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:33:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15190936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15190936</a><br>They will, but no one is going until NASA goes and no civvies will be allowed to go on the first trip with the NASA team.", "time": 1675989239, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190941, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:34:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15190910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15190910</a><br>2035 is a as far away as 2011", "time": 1675989253, "resto": 15186533}, {"no": 15190944, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:34:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15190932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15190932</a><br>Yeah, SpaceX will probably want their own system going on Mars by then.

And aswell leads to people conflating mathematical terminology with vernacular terminology that are completely different ideas, just because they are tangently related, and happen to use the same words (due mostly to mathematician&#039;s hubris in an attempt to declare they know the true meaning of the word, not even linguists have this level of certainty about the meaning of vernacular words even though they have more knowledge on the subject)<br>Examples of such concepts which have no basis in reality or are unproven but paraded as facts, or are seperate from their vernacular meaning are the following:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;number</span><br>seperate from its vernacular meaning<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;continuity of space and analogous concepts (such as the continuity of numbers when applied to space)</span><br>unproven<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;points in space with no width</span><br>unproven<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the cardnial 1 as the set of all singleton sets</span><br>seperate from the vernacular meaning<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sets in ZFC</span><br>people conflate these with groups of things in reality, when they aren&#039;t the same concept.<br>the most a mathematician can say to these critisims are &quot;they are useful, therefore we use them&quot;.
