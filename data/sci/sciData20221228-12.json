In the summer of 2021, president Biden said social media companies were \u201ckilling people\u201d for allowing vaccine misinformation.

I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers. The emergency generators, safety measures, redundancy facilities and black start plants are an immense cost to these corporations.", "time": 1671687207, "resto": 15068587}, {"no": 15070313, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)00:49:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070295</a><br>-&gt;cont... <br><br>So with this in mind, it should come as no surprise that these industries lobby against and hamstring the legislative process of implementing all of this.

Another anecdote: my mom is a Nurse Practitioner and says that she much prefers working with a majority of men rather than a majority of women. She says that having all female docs together often degenerates into toxic cat-fighting and whatnot. But I also wonder if the tenure of a female doc is shorter because of mat leave/motherhood, and how that might (or might not) impact the healthcare system.<br><a href=\"#p15077126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15077126</a><br>I&#039;ve seen this too, and it can happen for many reasons. Most commonly, I&#039;ve seen this: women like to go to class and do homework, at least the ones with above average intelligence. Of the &quot;smart&quot; men, there is a contingency that are interested and motivated and talented, and put in lots of work. There is usually another group of men that is smart, but they also resent university&#039;s gate-keeping and arbitrary bullshit and the ever-decreasing ROI of a college degree. Outside of that, there are always under performers. <br><a href=\"#p15077091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15077091</a><br>This is honestly the perfect job for women that don&#039;t want to get their hands at all dirty. Pays well, respected industry, and essentially 50% of what you do is make baby noises to stroke patients. Not to minimize what they do, but once you learn it, the job seems ez and comfy. I&#039;d never do it though because I wouldn&#039;t enjoy the work at all. <br><a href=\"#p15075816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15075816</a><br>I&#039;m tempted to think that this is both because women enroll in college more and because there is some serious &quot;minority&quot; preference when it comes to admission. <br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;15075724</span><br>Obviously not everyone, but the number of people I met like this in my program was obscene.

But how likely is the algorithm truly random? If it was truly random, it would preferrably be drawn by a bingo cage right? There is also the spotify shuffle feature that ISNT truly random, so who is to say the creators behind a lottery algorithm isn&#039;t a tiny bit biased or that it has a &quot;seed&quot;?
