I know two people who had parents in the foreign service and it does seem like it can be really good for kids since they get exposed to a lot, but it sucks if you get hardship deployments.<br><br>FEMA was really exciting and I loved the work, but is no good for a marriage. You are on deployments fairly often, up to half a year or more for some positions. Early in a deployment you work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. On big ones you can end up living out of military barracks. I personally found the fast pace intoxicating, it is what got me into government work and let me see how working in finance can let you work in any policy area, but I had to bail out when I got engaged.<br><br>TL;DR, consider local work. You can advance much more quickly and have a lot more impact. However, if you dislike politics and will respond poorly to being called simultaneously a racist, communist, etc. on local access TV at council meetings, then you might not enjoy advancing in that field.<br><br>I just started doing more direct work with schools as a consultant (only did higher level stuff as city CFO before, so they were just one department). Schools are neat because you have way more data on how your initiatives are actually effecting performance. That part is neat if you like social sciences in general. Plus, K-12 is the biggest source of state/local spending by a long shot. Teachers unions suck to negotiate with but it&#039;s still way better than the police, who are absolutely horrendous (I personally think police unions should be straight up illegal, you can&#039;t have two chains of command in a paramilitary organization)", "time": 1669917568, "resto": 15023534}, {"no": 15025361, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)13:10:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15025345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15025345</a><br>Either way, get good with some data languages. A ton of government finance work is based on shitty Excel spreadsheets. If you actually know how to use Excel, which very few people in finance do, you can be an absolute rock star and do the work of 10 people. Learn how to use lookups, index/match, etc. Learn how to do SQL queries. This is much easier now that Excel has Power Query built in. M is a very easy language to use and you can do plenty with just drop down menus. I think Excel allows for most DAX functions to be used within it now too, so those are worth learning. Excel is a bad tool but it is so ubiquitous that you have to learn in. And since stuff is going to be on Excel you might as well learn Power BI too so that you can make your reports interactive and self updating off of SQL queries. Hook up your ERP to an automated dashboard and your Boomer boss will think you&#039;re an IT god.<br><br>R is really good to know too for more advanced modeling. I would also learn something that lets you do Monte Carlo analysis since it is very useful for expense projections and capital budgets.<br><br>It&#039;s amazing how little you need to learn to be a comparatively advanced finance wiz in government.<br><br>I&#039;m actually considering leaving the industry to go for a research PhD (information theory or philosophy of information), but I did enjoy my work in government quite a bit.
