Everything you&#039;re saying makes sense, but I&#039;ve suddenly developed slight double vision at age 33 and glasses do correct it.

I fucking hate it. I need to fix this shit. My hair has begun turning white on the sides and I just got out of a long-term relationship and I&#039;m not going to find a wife if I have to add glasses on top of that. No one desirable is single at 33, but at least I could get away with it by having lots of meaningless sex to compensate for my insecurities before my vision began to blur and now I need fucking glasses. Well, for night time driving and screen reading at least. I fucking hate it. I might as well resign myself to being a genetic dead-end. The fucking diagnosis today has fucking devastated me. The only thing keeping me going is that I know I have MGD and I&#039;m hoping if I can cure it maybe my shit will correct itself. I&#039;ve been putting off heating my eyes for three years because it sounds fucking horrible but if it&#039;s that or glasses I&#039;ll pick the heat packs.

It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

Its a fictitious concept made up out of thin air. Pure fantasy. It can only be considered to exist as a concept, it can be discussed, manipulated, much like our flying pigs, but there is nothing real about it. Dealing with issues arsing from the concept of infinity in mathematics is just the same as catching flying pigs. Internally the discussion makes complete sense. Capture flying pigs with nets, create an infinite sum. When you are dealing with fantasies anything can be made to make sense, even by following logical rules that exist in the real world.<br><br>The whole issue arose when people first began speculating about the number line. What if it goes on forever? Well, fuck, then if it goes on forever then we surely need a concept that provides a convenient and manipulable placeholder. Thus infinity popped into existence as a concept, much the same way our Universe popped into existence from nothing. And unicorns, and fairies, and flying pigs.<br><br>What few people have been brave enough to consider is the idea that the Universe is truly finite.

He covers superficial everything you need to know to start with QM, you wont understand much about QM with that book. Why? Because he goes the Schroedinger Wavemechanics approach but doesn&#039;t go deep into it. Speaking of which, there are several different approaches of Quamntum mechanics, or lets say, formalism you could follow. The most known is the Wavemechanics by Schroedinger, the second is the Heisenbergian Matrixmechanics, the third is less of a formalism but involves Functional Analysis and therefore a bit of Matrix mechanics and its more of Mathematical Physics. One significant approach are Path Integrals by Feynman, also you shouldn&#039;t avoid Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, but i guess thats something that comes last. As for QM Books, have a quick List: &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Dirac. &quot;Matrix mechanics&quot; by H.S. Green (He was a student of Max Born), &quot;Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral Point of View&quot; by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe. &quot;Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals&quot; by Richard Feynman. Also Lev Landaus &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; out of his &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; though, there is a newer one which fused with the Quantumelectrodynamic book so beware, keep your eyes open for the older one. Also if you are in the mood i totally recommend the Feynman lectures which also include a book on QM. All of those books are very basic and teach you the various different approaches and formalisms. What i can&#039;t recommend, but will include is W. Paulis &quot;Wellenmechanik&quot; and Schroedingers &quot;Abhandlungen zur Wellenmechanik&quot;, &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Von Neumann. There are probably a few more, don&#039;t know, i am not at home, and those i don&#039;t recommend are gems but only useful if you know german and if you get your hands on them, but they are all rather Mathematical PHysics books so they&#039;ll teach the math behind.

Other animals use it to establish and maintain pecking orders and breeding rights. Since humans are mostly free from natural selection, we&#039;re mostly affected by sexual and artificial selection. The being the case, it&#039;s reasonable that a mechanism of behavior so widely observed in nature, is still practiced despite our increased intelligence, and our ability to contemplate morality.<br><br>In order to better understand this behavior, I think it&#039;s best to start by establishing that geography has a significant impact on culture. I.e, a group of people settle in an area, determine what the most comfortable existence they can establish is, and then create a culture that justifies that existence, while demonizing detracting behaviors, and encouraging behavior that supports the aforementioned culture. <br><br>How does bullying factor into all this? While no one likes the idea of being bullied, harassed, etc, we all enjoy upward social mobility, or at the very least, stability in regards to our current social position. By degrading others, especially in social settings such as school, a bully is able to publically announce their social standing, as at the very least, being above that of the person they are harassing. Most people never do anything to prevent the bullying of another, because that action introduces the opportunity for downward social mobility, with little in the way of possible rewards. Although we all like to believe we would do something heroic when we see wrongdoing, most psychological and sociological evidence points to the contrary.", "time": 1672994375, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103398, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br>It is also unsurprising that most bullies tend to not be extremely successful, and the most victims suffer longterm negative consequences. The type of person attracted to bullying will typically be a person that cannot establish a high social standing with physical ability or intelligence, so by demeaning others, especially those with traits they lack, they are able to create a level of social standing (albeit temporarily) usually unobtainable to them. Regarding the victims of bullying, this attitude of &quot;it toughens you up&quot;, is just ridiculous. While we can always expect negative social interactions to be a part of our experience as a social species, being harassed and abused is not to be expected, as it is maladaptive behavior. <br><br>I think it&#039;s also important to make a distinction between bullying that exists to elevate the social standing of the abuser, and the natural &quot;demonization&quot; of behavior that is seen as culturally inappropriate. As I mentioned before, all cultures seek to encourage some behavior and prevent others, and to the end, social settings have an unspoken code of conduct which is to be followed, or one will face social consequences. And these consequences tend to be focused on ostracization, instead of intentional physical or psychological abuse. As an example, if you were at store, and a person walked in dressed as an actual clown, most people would be uncomfortable around them, and treat them differently as a result, since they&#039;re violating social norms.

As a result of his physical trauma, his temperment, decision making, and emotions (all things that people often times think are manifestations of their own will) changed drastically. Is Gage (the self) truly responsible for the way he behaved after the injury?

It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

For example, the rhinovirus doesn&#039;t do well at warmer temperatures, so it tends to stay in the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 is better at infecting the lungs, but even then, I provided a study where only 64% of the infected had detectable viral particles in their blood, and this was using severe patients (mild cases appear to have a much lower rate, but that&#039;s from another study). The vaccinated, however, had detectable S1 sub unit in 84% of people.

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

IQ is a meaningless metric, but it represents the brain&#039;s natural ability to make connections in the context of western culture.

Humans evolved breasts as sexually attractive features precisely because they signalled infertility. A male primate who is not put off by, or even attracted to, breasts will stay with a female protecting her when she is in her most vulnerable state - during pregnancy and just after childbirth. For a female to select for such males improves her chances of successful reproduction. Moreover, in an environment where it is an advantage for males to stay with and support a female, a taste for breasts can keep the male investing in his own interest at the most critical time for support. In essence, permanent breasts had a pre-historic purpose of separating the men from the \u2018fuckboys\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My theory of the evolution of breasts is that they are an adaptation for a slow life history rather than a fast life history. Breasts are K-selected. r-selected animals with a fast life history have short lifespans and mature quickly. K-selected species have longer lifespans, invest more in their children and take longer to mature. Fast life history is an adaptation to unstable ecologies where mortality is more random and uncontrollable so the best option is to have as many offspring as possible. By contrast in predictable environments, there\u2019s an advantage to investing more in offspring to increase their chances.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Breasts by selecting for stable, long-term relationships between males and females facilitate long-term investment in offspring. It makes sense that only humans would have permanent breasts. Compared to other primates we have a slow life history strategy. We live for a particularly long time, take a long time to mature and need substantial resources and protection to develop our large brains.</span>", "time": 1672855373, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15099969, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlT<wbr>rGIW5iZ8", "filename": "dutton jolly heretic", "ext": ".png", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672855434181463, "time": 1672855434, "md5": "BfUid5W9LC1c6FBxF6EBPg==", "fsize": 41191, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15099975, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:06:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "booba", "filename": "couple_s_caress_by_jora_bora_dewp7yv-fullview", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1329, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672855601891133, "time": 1672855601, "md5": "KUlwc5GDfXKzfK32AykUjg==", "fsize": 149202, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15100692, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:23:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15099661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15099661</a><br>I would like to conduct further research into this area", "filename": "hakase", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1068, "h": 1425, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672874627270860, "time": 1672874627, "md5": "xHuo8fUnAgnhlmeO5M0QBw==", "fsize": 133963, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15100698, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:27:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15099661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15099661</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why do permanently enlarged breasts exist</span><br>Women are supposed to breastfeed their whole lives.

Not being too comformist (necessarily somewhat alienated). These are the only things that could for not being easily controlled. And they have exactly nothing to do with intelligence. Say an intelligent person has the well-formed body and mind to do well in society, go to university, focus on success in career, etc. How is this person going to end up sufficiently nonconformant, outwardly and/or inwardly, to not be controlled? How are they going to have the freedom to not follow the tide? They have everything to lose and they&#039;ve not been exposed to any other way of thinking and behaving. Being intelligent does not make you not gullible, not conforming, and if it did then intelligent people would choose to conform as it also has nothing to do with moral fibre and bigger thinking or truth. Part of conformism is the willingness to almost unconsciously overlook dishonesty and falsehood out of convenience.

Pressure will result in reserves being abolished in their immunity from harvest as well. Desire for resources drastically outweighs requirement for planetary guardianship. The grim reality is, humanity collectively is not evolved nor advanced enough to overcome the exponential upkeep it is experiencing. This is why elites default to depopulation as the solution, with the agenda for eco zones to be set forth as population densities mitigate to a significant measure. The reasoning behind cultural norms of reproducing is adjusted as needed. In the end, another form of reliable resource must be a true replacement and substitute that is easily used. The nature of waste materials produced by industries should be further examined for possibilities. It will be necessary in time. Prefab and synthetic building materials. Abodes will be hollow blocks of concrete and adhesives of all manner. There is no stopping it beyond facilitating agriculture and genetic modification of all plants to extremes. Unfortunately it would still be unsustainable without strict maintenance from humanity, and a sort of symbiotic process would be born in such a system, which would be interesting to see fully applied. But again, that&#039;s assuming we don&#039;t implode over other deficits of materials. I don&#039;t really have much faith they&#039;ll stop.

You can&#039;t perceive going back in time because perception is an entropic process and only occurs when time is moving forward.

While many Eastern European players follow the standard Soviet chess school of studying hard and methodical and not playing too many tournaments, Magnus does the complete opposite. He only does things with chess that he enjoys and never forces himself to do boring work. If he wants to take some time off, he does. And he keeps playing tournaments all the time, because he enjoys it.<br><br>Killer instinct. Magnus loves to compete and he always does everything in his power to win, whether it&#039;s playing chess, basketball, football, PlayStation or rock-paper-scissors.

The organisms that are more fit are those organisms that pass on their genes. That&#039;s it. Idiots often load the term with additional meaning, like &quot;healthier, stronger, faster, being able to outcompete&quot; but the simple mathematical reality is that &quot;fitness&quot; is merely a population-level calculus of what survives into the next generation. There is no intrinsic fitness of an organism. Not its previous evolutionary history, not its physical abilities, not its available resources. None of that. Those are mere influencers of the LIKELYHOOD of fitness, i.e. the likelihood of passing on your genes to your descendants. But fitness is fitness. If you had a population of rabbits and randomly killed half of them before they got to reproduce, the half that survives are BY DEFINITION more fit than the ones that died. it really is that simple. So when this imbecile constructs a model in which &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;reality perception&quot; are antagonistic, it is a matter of mathematical tautology that &quot;reality perception&quot; would go extinct, since in his VERY MODEL IT IS NOT FIT.<br><br>Moron.

Indeed, this is exactly what Ionnidas found in his famous &quot;Why Most Research Findings Are False.&quot; Publication bias is an example of information having added fitness because it is more suprising (context dependant) and findings which are false are more likely to be suprisingly pretty much definitionally in the Shannon framework.<br><br>But why should information in the form of books and websites have different selection pressures than sensory data in a nervous system or genes?

The detector has multiple filter strips, each with a different bandpass, bonded directly to its photoactive surface. Each strip extends the entire width of the detector, but only a fraction of its height; Junocam&#039;s filter strips are 1600 pixels wide and about 155 rows high. The filter strips are scanned across the target by spacecraft rotation. At the nominal spin rate of 2 RPM, frames are acquired about every 400 milliseconds. Junocam has four filters: three visible (red/green/blue) and a narrowband &quot;methane&quot; filter centered at about 890 nm.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The spacecraft spin rate would cause more than a pixel&#039;s worth of image blurring for exposures longer than about 3.2 milliseconds. For the illumination conditions at Jupiter such short exposures would result in unacceptably low SNR, so the camera provides Time-Delayed-Integration (TDI). TDI vertically shifts the image one row each 3.2 milliseconds over the course of the exposure, cancelling the scene motion induced by rotation. Up to about 100 TDI steps can be used for the orbital timing case while still maintaining the needed frame rate for frame-to-frame overlap. For Earth Flyby the light levels are high enough that TDI is not needed except for the methane band and for nightside imaging. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Junocam pixels are 12 bits deep from the camera but are converted to 8 bits inside the instrument using a lossless &quot;companding&quot; table, a process similar to gamma correction, to reduce their size. All Junocam products on the missionjuno website are in this 8-bit form as received on Earth. Scientific users interested in radiometric analysis should use the &quot;RDR&quot; data products archived with the Planetary Data System, which have been converted back to a linear 12-bit scale.</span><br>https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/ju<wbr>nocam/processing#AboutJunoCamImages<wbr>", "time": 1672953533, "resto": 15100454}, {"no": 15102417, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:25:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102328</a><br>Onan IS an anagram of anon, after all.", "time": 1672953954, "resto": 15100454}, {"no": 15102418, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:26:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102403</a><br>The image you posted are actually 12 frames with the spacecraft rotating.
