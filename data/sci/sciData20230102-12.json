If you don&#039;t have any experience with university yet and have to decide what to do it is easy to fall into the trap of associating majors directly with what you will work on later in your life. Mechatronical systems are cool as hell and having an understanding of all the parts sounds great, but in practice you will probably just end up doing one niche part for some bigger system and your goal should be to optimize your chances to get into more interesting niches and not to get an understanding of as many niches as possible.

With a deeper knowledge of math compared to the average engineer they can often get assigned the more &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; tasks. I put those in quotes because that of course is highly subjective, but in many fields you will realize that in order to understand and work with the more elementary methods, you need to have a really good understanding of math first.<br>Take for example cryptography as a really interesting sub-field of cybersecurity.

But you dig deeper and consulting is a stressful and morally disgusting job that barely anyone actually enjoyes.

They just want to get the money.<br><br>Now, I will admit that this is half true. Yes, I work for the money.

Now, look for the jobs that can pay enough for that... and there you go. That is your career goal.

Dead languages are also acceptable as they approximate to being pseudocode most of the time.<br><br>I have to make a lot of multidimensional arrays full of booleans go faster and get bigger.<br><br>Wikipedia said somebody called Grzegorczyk made Grzegorczyk Hierarchy and that it uses Successor Function to make arithmetic operators.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul.

Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers.

It is very readable and gives a broad overview of fields such as astronomy, physics, geology, biology and chemistry. I strongly recommend this one.<br>Asimov wrote a three-volume book about physics that was meant for a general audience: &quot;Understanding Physics&quot;. It talks about motion, heat, sound, light, electricity, magnetism and the atom (so mostly classical physics with some atomic physics at the end). <br>I remember reading a book called &quot;The Convergence&quot; by Peter Watson. It talks how as science evolves connections are made between disparate disciplines and one discipline solves problems in the other (for example, physicists developed quantum mechanics, which explains the periodic structure of the elements). I really recommend this one, but I&#039;ve heard that sometimes the guy says stuff that is wrong so beware. Still, it is really good. <br>Thirty years that shook physics: the story of quantum theory, by George Gamow. I really liked this one too to the point that I think taht reading it again would be worth it.<br>From Atoms to Quarks by James Trefil. It is a book about particle physics.<br>If you are willing to read something more demanding (not because it is more mathematically rigorous, but because it is more historically rigorous) I think that &quot;Quantum Generations: A history of physics in the 20th century&quot; would be worth it. Just the table of contents already gives you a great overview of modern physics. I suggest skipping some parts if they get boring to you.<br>&quot;17 equations that changed the world&quot; by Ian Stewart is pretty damn good. <br>Anyways, those are the ones that I could think off the top of my head.

Also, if he is innovative and has good funding lined up, it could be worthwhile. Also, younger professionals typically are more ambitious than well established profs because they still have to prove themselves, and are more hands-on too (but this may not necessarily be the case with everyone).

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven.

Outside of the hard sciences everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Hell, even some area of the hard sciences are highly suspect (e.g. String Theory). Many people, including those in scientific fields, have a very cargo cult approach to science. To them science is something published in a respectable enough journal and with p&lt;0.05. The soft sciences have been a joke for decades and are effectively just a propaganda arm for the Party. I don&#039;t think scientific inquiry will grind to a halt, but it will slow down, and some research will become verboten in the west. This is a list of things that I think we will not research anymore in the near future:<br>- nuclear fission for power generation (The money is on fusion now)<br>- heritability of human traits and in general everything that could show inherent disparity in abilities between humans and between human groups<br>- gain of function research (just kidding lol)<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672337652, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086184, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:15:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15086180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15086180</a><br>I&#039;m especially mad about the current situation of nuclear research. I can sort of accept the pozzing of research that goes directly against the dogmas of the woke religion, but the corruption of nuclear research really shows how power driven scientists have become. To the layman the recent breakthrough in fusion sounds like a great achievement but to someone who has actually mastered elementary school mathematics it only shows how scientist would lie (mostly by omission, but that&#039;s still a lie) only to gain funding and status for themselves. We could phase out fossil fuels in less than a decade, for electricity generation at least, using the nuclear technology we already have. If you want to get fancy you could start building pilot power plants based on the Thorium cycle and/or other new gen reactors. Instead we are funding boondoggles like fusion that will likely not be able to generate useful power for the next few decades. Or pouring money in meme stuff like renewables and hydrogen. To work well science requires a rather high degree of honesty, a degree of honesty that is above the paygrade of most people.

We analyzed data from 309 medical students who prepared for a high-stakes exam using a digital learning platform. Using log files from the learning platform, we assessed students\u2019 level of knowledge throughout the exam-preparation phase and their average performance in mock exams that were completed shortly before the final exam. The results showed that test anxiety did not predict exam performance over and above students\u2019 knowledge level as assessed in the mock exams or during the exam-preparation phase. Leveraging additional ambulatory assessment data from the exam-preparation phase, we found that high trait test anxiety predicted smaller gains in knowledge over the exam-preparation phase. Taken together, these findings are incompatible with the hypothesis that test anxiety interferes with the retrieval of previously learned knowledge during the exam.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/1<wbr>0.1177/09567976221119391</span>", "filename": "3801-770x433", "ext": ".png", "w": 770, "h": 433, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672502728451031, "time": 1672502728, "md5": "w85t+o/YTPEz3KMsX/aFvg==", "fsize": 348636, "resto": 15088187}, {"no": 15090576, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:04:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br><a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br>Take 600mg of phosphatidylserine everyday, 35% reduction in cortisol", "time": 1672506272, "resto": 15088187}, {"no": 15090577, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)12:05:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br>Stop giving a shit about the potential events the exam could cause?", "time": 1672506347, "resto": 15088187}, {"no": 15091882, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)05:34:39", "name": "N", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br>dude weed lmao", "time": 1672569279, "resto": 15088187}, {"no": 15091937, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)06:59:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br>Get enough sleep not one day but two days before an exam.", "time": 1672574362, "resto": 15088187}, {"no": 15092442, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)12:05:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15088187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15088187</a><br>Chew gum.

All the plausible measurements fit within a sine wave, so I&#039;d argue that the sine wave is the basic &quot;form&quot; of most particles, which only take easily-digestible particle forms when bombarded with energy (ie, a photon used to measure it).

Now, we have to look up the average mating session of a lonely shotacon woman. According to a paper made by H. Kojimbo, the number would be at least 4 hours, and it depends on the amount of time that has passed since the last intercourse of a woman. Since the problem gives us incomplete information, we can only assume that the last time Mrs. Tanaka saw her husband was also the last time they had sex. 6 months of chastity means that the session would take 6 hours.
