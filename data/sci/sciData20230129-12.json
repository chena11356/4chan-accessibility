Most likely your first customers will be mom n pop architect firms that need a mechanical designer for their plumbing and HVAC systems, simple stuff really, but it takes months if not years of persistence, pavement pounding, and unironically firm handshakes to get a client base. <br><br>t. licensed engineer w/ a freelance side hustle. if i wasn&#039;t making so much money at my day job i&#039;d do it full time. fuckin&#039; health insurance man.", "time": 1674786791, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156592, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:46:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15154116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15154116</a><br>how to transition from bachelors in neuroscience to career in zoology :)", "time": 1674787568, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156623, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)21:57:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15156592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15156592</a><br>eat caffeine pills, have a degree reassignment surgery and ask that people refer to you by your preferred credentials", "time": 1674788255, "resto": 15154116}, {"no": 15156633, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15155170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15155170</a><br>If you have to ask whether to major in mathematics, then please don&#039;t.

The problem is that in complex systems not everybody that works on them understands how every other part of the system works, that&#039;s obviously impractical, so knowledge in a project is necessarily extremely fragmented and you need somebody whose job it is to make sure the system as an integrated whole meets the million requirements that go into any complex engineering project.

If our brains were twice as big we could perceive more potential colors. Logically, if our brains were infinite size we could perceive infinite colors. How come the possible finite colors we could perceive (ie ones we&#039;ve never seen before) sometimes need more brainpower and sometimes need less? Perception of a new color X should not require a brain the size of a dump truck just to perceive one color, but that is the logical consequence once all other unknown colors have been exhausted. Why couldn&#039;t the perception of color blue be swapped with the color X for the same brain mass?<br>The response: &quot;because x needs more brain mass&quot; is not an explanation.

This lead to credential inflation as companies increased their requirements for academic degrees while the government made getting such degrees easier and easier.

Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

This presentation provides a new theory and description of what is going on, and is able to arrive at the same calculations as traditional Quantum theory, but by using crude and basic mathematics that any person of average I.Q. can understand. The way that this is possible is by changing the paradigm of the description of the statistical results. The particles are seen to be Independent Events, and the more simple an explanation, the more likely it is to be closer to the truth of the description of reality. The new theory points in the direction of a possible Nonlocal Hidden Variable Theory. Finally, this theory proposes to serve as a possible bridge between the laboratory results and Einstein\u2019s classically deterministic probability expectations.<br><br>After many various private calculations and versions of the same essential concepts, it is believed that the Probability differences in Bell\u2019s Inequality can be accounted for in relation to the results in the laboratory.<br><br>We will take a look at one version of the Entanglement test.

It&#039;s not (just) about fun, it&#039;s mostly hard work and research-wise a lot of frustration, but anyway, I see two main end goals in going to study mathematics:<br>1. To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground. For the second one, we get lost again, because how do we react when we are presented a real-life model? Will we remember Theorem #378546 along with Lemma #648364 can be applied?

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right. One must always take the smallest available size of a colour, but the larger sizes are obviously more powerful, so bank management is an important aspect of the game.<br>I found it via <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/catalog#s=bgg%2C\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/bgg,</a> and you can play it online on bga.", "time": 1674648904, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152201, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>Anything board game related with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; ?", "time": 1674649967, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152263, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)08:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Onions (japanese shitgames) can be found on <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a>", "time": 1674652296, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152372, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)09:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152201</a><br>Stratego?", "time": 1674656896, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152509, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>The different characters should have different shillouettes<br>If you disagree, you are contrarion.", "time": 1674663385, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152895, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144090</a><br>Which for humans, is always", "time": 1674675057, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15153740, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This game I invented called empty go.

During the attack phase you can choose to attack any number of your opponents pieces. If you attack an enemy piece your opponents can choose to defend it. In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board. This is done by pulling the twine taught above the board. In other words there must be a straight line connecting the piece to each side of the board for it to be defended. However, lines cannot pass through an enemy piece. During the maneuver phase place one piece on the board. You cannot play on top of or overlap another piece. Pieces can hang off the edge if the board as long as their center is on it. If you cannot place a piece, you lose.

See pic, especially my favorite part, here<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is now overwhelming biological and behavioral evidence that the brain contains no stable, high-resolution, full field representation of a visual scene, even though that is what we subjectively experience (Martinez-Conde et al. 2008). The structure of the primate visual system has been mapped in detail (Kaas and Collins 2003) and there is no area that could encode this detailed information.</span><br>The subjective experience is thus inconsistent with the neural circuitry. This is just the visual binding problem by the way, there are many more.<br>Note: Notice they don&#039;t say &#039;the circuitry hasn&#039;t yet been found&#039;. The whole thing has been ALREADY BEEN MAPPED. Subjective experience is INCONSISTENT WITH NEURAL CIRCUITRY. So there is no one to one correspondence between brain and mind. So any &#039;physicalism of the gaps&#039; model fails. Any appeal to a one to one mapping some day FAILS. The computational theory of mind FAILS to account for consciousness. Computation is ONE of the things that consciousness DOES, as well as reasoning. We also already know that humans minds can harness computation to mimic some of the things that their own consciousnesses DO, but this says nothing about creating an experiencer to experience such experiences. You can&#039;t do that . A piece of virtual meat in spacetime is not the seat of consciousness and software created BY consciousnesses (that&#039;s what AI is) immersed in a VR is also NOT the seat of a consciousness either. This piece of meat you think creates consciousness never even needs to beed rendered ie have defined measurements in spacetime unless measured/observed, at which time what is probable to be there will be there, the same as with all matter.

Additionally, comparing IQ levels between different species is not a meaningful or scientifically valid comparison as IQ tests are designed specifically for human intelligence and cannot be applied to other species.", "time": 1674965907, "resto": 15158844}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15159924, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:04:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what did the martians mean by this?", "filename": "1674876582494791", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 635, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 211, "tim": 1674911060287204, "time": 1674911060, "md5": "m3qLuA3gadW1w5s6MVYF1Q==", "fsize": 202383, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-did-the-martians-mean-by-this", "replies": 13, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 14}, {"no": 15159926, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:05:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159924</a><br>That&#039;s not a bear.

Calculus was something people used to solve problems rather informally until Fourier discovered the solutions to the heat equations, which involve a special series of trigonometric functions, but they couldn&#039;t be dealt with simply like the series people were used to. What grew out of that was Analysis, which formalized calculus because the old way of doing things didn&#039;t work. <br><br>This is all to say, calculus is something best guided by intuition, and those intuitions can than be formalized in an introduction to Analysis.

Taylor series are pretty easily derived as well. However the world calculus was born out of is gone, so learning it in the modern day is completely uninspired.

(Melinda Gates, who focused the second half of the letter on gender equality, prefers Wheat Chex). He punctuates his letter with a simple mathematical equation he concocted that underscores the need for what he calls an \u201cenergy miracle\u201d.<br><br>P x S x E x C = CO2 (carbon dioxide output).<br><br>It\u2019s a neat little formula because it drives home the point: that for all the Paris climate talks and more affordable Teslas, environmental incrementalism is somewhat pointless. In the equation, P = population; S = services used by people; E= the energy needed to power those services; and C equals the carbon dioxide created by that energy. Population is of course trending ever-higher, as are the services people demand, especially in the developing world which has barely scratched the surface in terms of cars and air conditioning and other modern basics. Those two factors swamp progress in energy efficiency. Gates points out that scientists are calling for an 80 percent drop in carbon emissions by 2050 (and a total end by 2100) to stave off the most dramatic effects of climate change, yet even with more efficiency, the growth in population and services means that emissions will instead jump by 50%.<br><br>Math 101: the only way to get to zero carbon dioxide output is to drop one of those inputs to zero. Since eliminating any carbon byproduct of energy is preferable to a complete human die-off or a stone age suite of services, that\u2019s the only path. Shaving at the margins simply won\u2019t get the job done; only a moonshot solution that provides unlimited clean energy will stave off environmental (and thus, economic) catastrophe.<br><br>https://archive.md/yI8Zu", "filename": "FnfF07LWYAA49rJ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 798, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1674897339480741, "time": 1674897339, "md5": "8IWaTqW4B7naBpFObm8nEA==", "fsize": 87481, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "climate-change-is-over-pack-it-home-boys", "replies": 35, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 17}, {"no": 15159526, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)04:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159523</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dysgenic depopulation shill releases predictable propaganda nugget to indoctrinate golem children in state prisons</span><br>BREAKING NEWS!", "time": 1674897440, "resto": 15159523}, {"no": 15159938, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:18:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159523</a><br>I&#039;ve been shilling this idea for months but they didn&#039;t mention the most important part (PSEC)/ (NI) = CO2", "time": 1674911910, "resto": 15159523}, {"no": 15159995, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:04:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159523</a><br>Gates is Senile though.

Air molecules have an average velocity based on the density of air. Sometimes, that motion is upwards, sometimes it isn&#039;t.

This is consistent with other observations like EM being stronger than gravity on small scales.

It wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent the upper layers from escaping into a much more powerful vacuum at higher altitudes where gravity is weaker.

So like I said earlier, complicated field with lots of nuance so it&#039;s probably worth spending some time actually researching it yourself if you&#039;re genuinely curious.<br>Or you&#039;re making a thinly veiled religion v science thread then you&#039;re a faggot", "time": 1674891842, "resto": 15159259}, {"no": 15160375, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:44:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159458</a><br>lmao", "time": 1674927841, "resto": 15159259}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15157514, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:12:08", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/sfg/ - Space Flight General", "com": "I&#039;m of ideas for an edition, but a thread needs to be made Edition <br><br>Previous: <a href=\"/sci/thread/15152966#p15152966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152966</a>", "filename": "StrappedSeal", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 580, "h": 430, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 185, "tim": 1674825128416935, "time": 1674825128, "md5": "EIiNrbvkM4lHdyDC7SKzPQ==", "fsize": 78016, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sfg-space-flight-general", "replies": 578, "images": 146, "unique_ips": 107}, {"no": 15157521, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "first for me", "time": 1674825319, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15157540, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:24:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157514</a><br>of ideas", "time": 1674825890, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15157552, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:30:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157540</a><br>Pardon, I skip words sometimes.", "time": 1674826232, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15157557, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:32:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt; 30 minutes when there wasn&#039;t /sfg/ on /sci/</span><br>I&#039;m still shaking bros :(", "filename": "Paul Hudson shuttle hubble", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 957, "h": 608, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1674826347392856, "time": 1674826347, "md5": "TJ/kVMPrT/O/m/df7uasBQ==", "fsize": 105384, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15157561, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:36:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157557</a><br>Just let sfg rest in peace.", "time": 1674826609, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15157576, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:45:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cosmo-trash</span><br>Did we just have an /sfg/ thread die without some faggot doing that &quot;stage&quot; shit?

This design produces more power while using less fuel than today\u2019s propulsion systems and has the potential to power both human landers and interplanetary vehicles to deep space destinations, such as the Moon and Mars. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Engineers at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and primary collaborator IN Space LLC, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, are confirming data from RDRE hot fire tests conducted in 2022 at Marshall\u2019s East Test Area. The engine was fired over a dozen times, totaling nearly 10 minutes in duration.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The RDRE achieved its primary test objective by demonstrating that its hardware \u2013 made from novel additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, designs and processes \u2013 could operate for long durations while withstanding the extreme heat and pressure environments generated by detonations. While operating at full throttle, the RDRE produced over 4,000 pounds of thrust for nearly a minute at an average chamber pressure of 622 pounds per square inch, the highest pressure rating for this design on record.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Additional milestones achieved during the test include the successful performance of both deep throttling and internal ignition. This successful demonstration brings the technology closer to being used with future flight vehicles, enabling NASA and commercial space to move more payload and mass to deep space destinations, an essential component to making space exploration more sustainable. Because of NASA\u2019s recent success with the RDRE, follow-on work is being conducted by NASA engineers to develop a fully reusable 10,000-pound class RDRE to identify performance benefits over traditional liquid rocket engines.</span>", "time": 1674922408, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15160274, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:48:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15160049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15160049</a><br>my first lunar orbiter in this save, its an abomination of soviet and american engines with a srb as the lunar capture burn stage but it works", "filename": "orbiter", "ext": ".png", "w": 1916, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674924535865966, "time": 1674924535, "md5": "M2Bl2nteboaCC6Fh0dYr2w==", "fsize": 1102768, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15160287, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:53:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15160166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15160166</a><br>did you loose control because of lost signal or when staging? if its lost signal then thats because the ground stations dont cover the entire earth and when flying over the pacific you often loose signal. if its when staging you likely dont have the right amount of avionics and need to fix it in the editor", "time": 1674924787, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15160327, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:17:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15160274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15160274</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.5 TWR on liftoff</span><br>Christ", "filename": "C8F00743-AE82-4992-ADD5-3D8656907F0F", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 830, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1674926270550321, "time": 1674926270, "md5": "z3cqWXzZZWfbYfPTVnlexw==", "fsize": 2077078, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15160328, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:17:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159807</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Federation doesn&#039;t notice a fleet of ships shooting up Mars and find out where they came from </span><br>Picard was made for mental midgets", "filename": "Ford Mars Lander, James Vaughan", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 920, "h": 634, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1674926271564035, "time": 1674926271, "md5": "KTh3AeiIeD/jp4gwakhRng==", "fsize": 103852, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15160333, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:21:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "We need a KSP movie.

In the 1980s, American journalist James Oberg researched space-related disasters in the Soviet Union, but found no evidence of these Lost Cosmonauts. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, much previously restricted information has been made available, including information on Valentin Bondarenko, a would-be cosmonaut, whose death during training on Earth was covered up by the Soviet government. Even with the availability of published Soviet archival material and memoirs of Russian space pioneers, no evidence has emerged to support the Lost Cosmonaut theories. Ilyushin, who died in 2010, also never gave any support to conspiracy theories. </span><br><br>It&#039;s plausible given the character of the Soviet government, but it&#039;d be really odd that they were able to keep those casualties concealed while other Soviet-era shit came to light after the wall came down.", "time": 1674960995, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161397, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)21:57:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161394</a><br>as long as they don&#039;t outright stop SpaceX I don&#039;t really care", "time": 1674961033, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161402, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:02:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161397</a><br>Well, probably not, but it&#039;s kind of annoying that you can&#039;t share your interests or passion with other people without being vilified or criticized for it, like any other normal person could.", "time": 1674961374, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161407, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:05:00", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Military spaceplane system architecture Koozin, 2003 National Aerospace Initiative space z", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 613, "h": 395, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1674961500050082, "time": 1674961500, "md5": "9977Dcd1HmXd/RYhkObdXw==", "fsize": 49737, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161409, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:06:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161407</a><br>Would a biamese spaceplane suffer the same foam strike issue as the shuttle?", "time": 1674961578, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161415, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161391</a>", "filename": "Integrated Space Transportation Plan before the Presidential Vision announcement of January 14, 2004 Rogacki, 2003", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 613, "h": 403, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1674961851947353, "time": 1674961851, "md5": "PlPiOE1JqsH8MX/R4KhWTw==", "fsize": 46641, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161427, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161217</a><br>kek saved", "time": 1674962223, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161430, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:18:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161415</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Further extend as crew and/or cargo vehicle?</span><br>I love how whenever NASA was talking about replacing or retiring the Shuttle there was always this crowd of jackasses who would go &quot;But what if we just kept flying it past 2022?&quot; You just know after Columbia they were pointing out that we still had three perfectly good shuttle we could be launching.", "time": 1674962316, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161435, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:21:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161430</a><br>After Challenger, The shuttle was going to fly Until either freedom/iss is deorbited or a second loss of crew+ Some years, whichever came first", "time": 1674962518, "resto": 15157514}, {"no": 15161440, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:24:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15161312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15161312</a><br>Holy shit that&#039;s dreadful.

According to scientists, this happens every seven decades as part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation. A new study suggests there may be a connection between the inner core&#039;s spin and life on Earth&#039;s surface, as changes in the core&#039;s spin coincide with changes in other geophysical observations such as the length of day and magnetic field.<br><br>The study, conducted by scientists at Peking University in China, found that the inner core is slowing down and reversing its rotation. The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the inner core&#039;s rotation slowed significantly beginning in 2009. The study also found that a larger, decade-long pattern may be at play, with the rotation of the inner core varying on a decade-long timescale and reversing course every 7 decades.<br><br>It is important to note that the inner core is a solid ball surrounded by a fluid outer core, which allows it to rotate at a different pace compared to the planet&#039;s outer layers. The study of the Earth&#039;s core is difficult and there is much disagreement over the interpretation of data. Scientists suggest that journalists can avoid inaccuracies by double-checking with scientists themselves.<br><br>Although the changes won&#039;t have much impact on life on the surface, more research is needed to understand the significance of the inner core&#039;s rotation on the planet&#039;s geophysical processes.", "time": 1674804160, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157052, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:54:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157026</a><br>thanks for bumping a dead popsci spam thread that nobody wanted to see again in order to show us a block of low iq text that nobody is going to read", "filename": "104 low iq", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 441, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674806099297995, "time": 1674806099, "md5": "hPy362RSSEZdiKEUyb15Sg==", "fsize": 170944, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157152, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:35:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15147911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15147911</a><br><br>Correct.
