All of which might be pointless anyways because intelligence is negatively correlated with the number of kids you have, so unless theres a point like breeding the person who&#039;ll solve the riemann hypothesis (which isnt guaranteed) then they&#039;ll just experience negative selection on intelligence after that anyways.<br><br>Polygenic scores are limited. Every population has a natural upper intelligence limit due to standing variation and heterozygosity. Going above that limit requires mutations which happen at a snail&#039;s pace. Also in the immediate generations after forming the ethno state they may experience negative selection on intelligence and go back down to 85 IQ, mostly due the possibility that it&#039;d cause high rates of autism/schizophrenia which are negatively correlated with fertility.

I did not know Dover Recreational Math existed before now. It appears there are a lot of Dover Recreational Math books and they are all cheap, so probably I will buy several because book title sounds fun and cover art is nice. Are there any other books you think are fun or interesting in this series?<br><br>Also I might have to read about something called Grzegorczyk Hierarchy because Wikipedia said he made arithmetic operations with Successor Function.

In the summer of 2021, president Biden said social media companies were \u201ckilling people\u201d for allowing vaccine misinformation.

I genuinely blame this separation for most of why the humanities went to shit over the 20th century, why academic philosophy is so fruitless and why literature has become a self-flagellating circlejerk that deconstructed itself so hard its corpse had to be resurrected so we could reread all these classic works &quot;through a marxist lens&quot; ($$$). Now you are either a STEM kid or a humanities kid, and naturally neither values the contributions of the other. For us to really get on track, we need to return to interdisciplinary education. We need to provide opportunities for people to do it, and return to a culture where it is normal and encouraged.

It states that ei\u03c0 + 1 = 0[2], which can be interpreted as a fact about the number -1 on the complex plane: its distance from the origin is 1, and its angle from the positive real axis is \u03c0 radians[3].

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

You&#039;re technically phasing through the simulation constantly but the simulation compensates for this by adjusting positions proportionally based on mass. At a high enough velocity/energy getting stuff to phase through is really trivial, academics naively call this &quot;quantum tunneling&quot; based off their misunderstanding of reality. The trick to phase with macroscopic low-velocity entities is to exploit the compensation of the collision detection. This is why I engage in non-axis aligned collision at the point where three right-angles come together (a corner). With enough attempts eventually the macroscopic object will be phased back and forth between two or three axis as the simulation tries to correct the position, but ends up kicking you out of the geometry entirely.

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

You are clearly pro-censorship, but most socialists and progressives like myself tend to support free speech and academic freedom.

The Black Hebrew Israelite movement has distributed flyers outside stadiums claiming that Jews are Amalek and have conspired to hide the true identity of the Israelites[4]. However, these claims have no basis in fact.The Bible states that God made a Covenant with Abraham and his descendants, all the way to the 12 Tribes of Israel[1]. DNA tests have shown that Jews from Eastern Europe and Russia have no connection at all to the Israelites[1], so it is not accurate to say that even numbers are the real Jews.<br><br>1. https://gracethrufaith.com/ask-a-bi<wbr>ble-teacher/are-todays-israelis-rea<wbr>l-jews<br>2. https://washingtoncitypaper.com/art<wbr>icle/235518/the-real-jews<br>3. http://246mag.com/a-brief-debunking<wbr>-of-the-blacks-are-the-real-jews-th<wbr>eory<br>4. https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/anti<wbr>semitism/article-723255", "time": 1672307292, "resto": 15083683}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15083133, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)07:47:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I need software or a way to visualize something /sci/.

To be honest I am not even sure what im looking for or if it even exists, but if it is possible to create this map myself then I can do it, but it would be easier if there was a software or a tool for it.
