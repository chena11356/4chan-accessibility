Once the physical system (universe) is shown to be a contingent entity (it is contingent because it began, so it demands an explanation/cause), then there follows the logical necessity for and entity possessing at least some of the attributes commonly ascribed to god, namely the ability to initiate systems such as the physical (virtual) universe, and the attribute of not being temporally constrained. So not bound by time (cycles). The non-contingent entity (god) is called a necessary being in philosophical terms. Aquinas coined this term. Leibnitz formed arguments based on this concept as well. It was a way to express informally logically the necessity for a creator without bringing a particular theology into it. So the contingent being (universe) demands a cause/explanation for it&#039;s existence. the cause can&#039;t itself also be contingent, ie have a beginning, or else you get an infinite regress of contingent entities, ie &#039;well, if god created the universe, then who created god&#039;, ad infinitum. So the regress can be avoided by just postulating a single entity which wasn&#039;t itself booted up, ie not temporally constrained, ie didn&#039;t begin/outside of time (cycles).

It follows that the universe freely determines its own constraints, the establishment of nomology and the creation of its physical (observable) content being effectively simultaneous and recursive.

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

I can imagine screen and still &quot;see&quot; it. So what are we seeing here? We&#039;re just seeing an internal model of the screen.

A model that someone thinks of themselves. Their physical body (as in the case of &quot;out of body experience&quot;). But how can the physical body be the observer? Its not but thats the best thing they have. <br>So then it shifts back to &quot;well, sure its a model&quot; &quot;but i exist when I observe something.&quot; Do you?

The toilet flush produces a strong chaotic jet with velocities exceeding 2 m/s; this jet transports aerosols to heights reaching 1.5 m within 8 seconds of initiating a flush.

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book.

I&#039;ll likely be making a full thread on this at some point in the near future to go over all the evidence that the weird symptoms I&#039;ve been experiencing since the start of mass vaccinations in my area must indeed be caused by the spike protein (I am unvaxxed). The symptoms I experience are heart palpitations (I can feel the beats go out of and back into sync when I feel my pulse, so they are real palpitations) and repeated burping (like, I&#039;ll have to let out small burps a few times a minute until I&#039;m able to get fresh air, it&#039;s like I&#039;ve ingested poison or something and my body is trying to get it out).<br> I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;ve done that has helped me, but first, note that I really suspect this is not from the spike protein itself but actually misfolded/misconstructed proteins created as a result of damaged mRNA making it&#039;s way into vaccinated cells, these proteins clump together with other proteins and create amyloid plaques in the blood stream (hence heart palpitations from restricted flow); nattokinase resolves the symptoms I experience quickly and almost completely, which supports the amyloid plaque hypothesis as it is known for its ability to dissolve these plaques.<br> Second, my real worry here is that whatever it is affecting far more people than just me, only I&#039;m one of the few that&#039;s noticing anything is wrong, who knows how damaging this stuff really is?<br><br>(cont&#039;d)", "time": 1674364201, "resto": 15140208}, {"no": 15143138, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:11:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15143137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15143137</a><br><br>In addition to nattokinase, which, as I mentioned, is one of the best ways to deal with the effects of shedding, I&#039;ve also had some success with the following supplements:<br> 1) Vit D and Zinc.

Reduced the symptoms to some degree but not entirely. Unlike nattokinase, which acts very quickly (&lt;30 minutes), takes some time (hours) to have any noticeable effect.<br> 3) Apple cider vinegar. Helps a lot, especially with the stomach issues, probiotic so is good for gut health in general. Is also a mild blood thinner.<br> 4) Aspirin. I&#039;ve found half a full strength aspirin can reduce or remove the palpitations quite quickly (about an hour). Unlike NAC/Natto, shouldn&#039;t be taken on an empty stomach though.<br> 5) Avoid excess dietary iron. Don&#039;t eat enriched flour or grains.

Even at ordinary temperatures, traditional drills wear out and need to be replaced. Just a few months ago, I described a mechanism to enhance existing ground-penetrating warheads. The essence of that mechanism should translate into a useful drilling mechanism with slight modification. As you will read, the per se drilling mechanism is useless without the propulsive mechanism and so the propulsive mechanism could be, in the abstract, considered part of the drilling mechanism. For my purposes, I am describing them separately. If you wish to learn more about photo-magnetic propulsion, please refer to the archived thread on that topic. For reference, the four primary steps in a photo-magnetic propulsive action are 1.) light Emission, 2.) polarity Uniforming, 3.) light Solitonization and 4.) Actuation (EUSA.)<br><br>At its most basic, the ground-penetrating mechanism calls for the object&#039;s skin to be coated with a thin layer of special C60 fullerene molecules with an iron atom embedded in the center of each. The skin of the penetrator would be an electromagnet that strongly acts upon the iron to prevent its attrition by friction. The energy requirement to counteract this friction would be non-trivial and the limited duration for which this magnetic field must endure makes that particular proposal feasible. In the case of the FeC60-enhanced penetrator, the FeC60, being in constant motion and constantly seeking equilibrium, knocks debris out of the way, reducing effective friction with the Earth by blowing material out of the path of the warhead a few atoms at a time, much as explosives enable the free-fall of a building by moving material out of the way.", "time": 1674365535, "resto": 15143156, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15143159, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)00:33:25", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "In the case of a drilling mechanism utilizing FeC60 as a cutting mechanism, the mechanism must operate at a lower and more sustainable power level for a much longer duration. This mechanism would in large part depend upon the application of pressure, much as is the case with screwdrivers and screws. Since FeC60 would cover only a few nanometers of thickness, the speed at which drilling could proceed would be quite slow, with progress working on the timescale of a space mission and not traditional drilling operations.<br><br>Another key difference in the case of FeC60 usage for drilling applications is that the magnetism applied to the skin of the drilling face of the unit would need to alternate to ensure constant motion of the FeC60 spheres. The effect would be nano-ablative, but speed would be at least partly dictated by the amount of force with which the photo-magnetic drive can push the unit into the Earth. If the cooling system is sufficiently effective, routing the craft through magma pockets so as to be able to &quot;swim&quot; rather than cut through much of the Earth may be more expedient. If sufficient cooling cannot be sustained for long stretches of time, magma pockets would need to be avoided and the slower drilling process would need to be entirely relied upon.<br><br>The most important thing is that the cutting mechanism never wear away or fail.

The propulsive system, situated primarily in the rear of the craft, would be programmed to work in tandem with the cutting mechanism.<br><br>Rather than applying constant force, the pulses of thrust are alternated with cutting actions so that the FeC60 material, after penetrating into another nanoscopic layer and softening it up, is retracted and the magnetic field is re-normalized just prior to a pulse of thrust being used to cause the now-flat nose of the craft to pulverize the already-weakened material one thin layer at a time. The cycle time would be about one millisecond for the spike formation plus another five milliseconds for thrusting. With each cycle of spike formation and thrusting, spikes would form in slightly different positions on the skin of the nose of the craft.

Acacia, tagasaste, date palms... Plant cover provides more shade and biomass to further improve the soil. You might need some irrigation for a few years to establish these, if conditions are harsh.

It explains the photoelectric effect, crystallography, mineralogy, electronics, the spectral emissions of materials, the light transmission properties of materials, heat conductivity differences between materials, etc.<br><br>Atoms are not really that small, single atom work is incredibly common in condensed matter physics. We absolutely understand atomic structure and have used it to make nearly all of the advances in material science over the last century.<br><br>What is a bit more uncertain is the structure of an atomic nucleus, but even that has nearly 100 years of direct experiment supporting our model. It&#039;s way, way more understood than &quot;nobody knows so I&#039;ll buy a cool sounding website and make some shit up&quot;. Radioactive decay, neutron transmission of materials, nuclear bombs, nuclear reactors, etc all support the current model. If another model worked better, don&#039;t you think militaries around the world would use it to make better bombs?<br><br>What is actually not super well understood is the structure of individual protons and neutrons. We know the quark model and quantum chromodynamics explain particle collisions extremely well, but there are a few competing models for how exactly the quarks combine into a proton, and different experiments support different models.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw <br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool. <br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673942251870097, "time": 1673942251, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "please keep the /sfg/ content in the /sfg/ thread", "time": 1673943506, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130884, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130848</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeorids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power. <br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him.

The 20-year-old said on Twitter that it was possible that Musk could have used one of SpaceX&#039;s designated planes for a trip to the launch site in Starbase, Texas, but deemed it &quot;unlikely&quot; based on previous observations of his flight data.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Most often the jet is in San Francisco before the Twitter takeover it was rarely there,&quot; Sweeney tweeted via his new Twitter account @ElonJetNextDay. &quot;This would suggest Twitter is a significant distraction to Tesla &amp; SpaceX.&quot;</span><br>latest from eloninsider.com", "time": 1674347312, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142647, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:37:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142633</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SpaceX&#039;s main launch site</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brownsville</span><br>Classic BI<br>though they have a point this time", "time": 1674347869, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142648, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:37:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142633</a><br>Mommy&#039;s running the show now!", "time": 1674347872, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142650, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:39:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;excited that if plasma magnet sail works it means Mars is just 1 month away max with Starship</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;remember there&#039;s no way to slow down from those insane speeds with the same technique</span><br><br>fuck, there&#039;s always something", "time": 1674347951, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142651, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:39:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142622</a><br>How stupid are you that this surprises you?", "time": 1674347966, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142654, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:40:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142633</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;business insider</span><br>i havent seen a legitimate story from them in fucking years. every time it&#039;s anti-musk fanfiction", "time": 1674348057, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142656, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:42:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142601</a><br>literally who", "time": 1674348124, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142657, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:42:04", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "FnCTUniXkAEs6mv", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 2008, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674348124838504, "time": 1674348124, "md5": "CH4dW9AHn+LW0G6h5VlzLA==", "fsize": 633591, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142658, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:42:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142657</a><br>Would it work bros?", "time": 1674348170, "resto": 15139841}, {"no": 15142660, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:43:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142648</a><br>Wait until she gets more popular, says something controversial, and boom! turns out she was actually a fraud all along, and the real person behind it all was the next one in command at spacex.

The theory states that it created a harsher environment and thereby, increased selection pressures. Meaning, you would have to be more genetically fit to survive during such a time period (on average) than you would in say today&#039;s slightly warmer climate. Harsher selection pressure means a healthier populace and health and intelligence are inseparable qualities. In short, the weak and less intelligent would have not been able to reproduce as easily (keep their offspring alive and healthy) as the already genetically healthy and intelligent.

Genuis is a curious and poorly understood thing that is often accompanied by some mild illness. However, you can&#039;t use people like newton as an example against selection for intelligence. Firstly, genuis is thought to be the product of mutation between two intelligent (healthy) parents that produces a person with outlier high iq. His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing. Given the correlation between wealth and intelligence of 0.8 its fairly safe to assume that Newtons late father was an, at least reasonably, intelligent man. His mother was the daughter of a butcher (if I recall correctly?) an esteemed profession at the time which would have required intelligence to be successful in.

If you look this up you&#039;ll find Google telling you the opposite, but it&#039;s not true. Given this trend you&#039;d expect the average IQ in England to be around 85 in the next 100 years. Given immigration from the middle east and Africa, we can expect this date to arrive much sooner. Now tell me, what is the probability that you find a person with an IQ of 140+ (the rough boundary of genuis) in a country such as Trinidad where the average iq is in fact 85? Your theory purports that if we just let more low iq people fill the world and lower average iqs well get more genuises despite the fact that that the probability of genuis falls faster than populations grow.

So here is what I&#039;ll do: define multiplication, and then, using induction, prove the properties you mentioned. The key idea is that when we say m * n, we mean &quot;the sum of n parcels equal to m&quot;. More precisely, for every natural number m, let [math]f_m: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}[/math] be defined as [math]f_m(p) = p + m[/math] so that [math]m \\cdot (n + 1) = (f_m)^n(m)[/math], where (f_m)^n is f_m iterated with itself n times. You might argue that this is just as arbitrary as the properties I am trying to prove, but I would disagree: the definition of m * (n + 1) is just the translation of &quot;the sum of n+1 parcels equal to m&quot; to the mathematical language. <br><br>Now with the definition of multiplication in mind, we see that [math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[\\math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]. This is really the heart of the first property. Now, the proof is as follows: let X be the set of natural numbers p such that (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p for every natural number m, n. I already have proved that 1 is in X above. Then, suppose p is in X, we will prove that (p+1) is also in X:<br><br>[math]\\begin{align}(m + n)\\cdot(p + 1)&amp;= (m+n)\\cdot p + (m +n) \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + n \\cdot p + m + n \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + m + n \\cdot p + n \\\\&amp;=m\\cdot(p+1)+n\\cdot(p+1) \\end{align}[/math]<br><br>There, I used the hypothesis that p is in X and the addition properties. We can conclude, by induction, that X = N. So we have just proved the first property. Oh fuck, I am not proving the second one, fuck it, but it just as easy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 80 iq retard</span>", "time": 1673916393, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130153, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130148</a><br>[math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[/math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]", "time": 1673916529, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130157, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are any of you guys like, professional mathematicians or have made a career out of math?<br>I kinda went NEET mode for 3 years...

The first rehabilitative stage was restricted by eating 2,000\u20133,000 calories a day. The second rehab phase was unrestricted letting the subjects eat as much food as they would like.</span><br>These studies returned valuable data that no ethics board would allow during peacetime.
