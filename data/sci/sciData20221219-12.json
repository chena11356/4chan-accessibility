The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet. In 2010, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, there were 33,655 Americans with doctorates collecting food stamps. Together, they could fill a stadium. The 293,029 Americans with master\u2019s degrees collecting food stamps could fill Cincinnati.</span><br>Jesus Christ, I always joked about &quot;the state of academia&quot; but this is just nightmarish", "time": 1671290369, "resto": 15056180}, {"no": 15059929, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)11:01:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15059762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15059762</a><br>2021* my bad", "time": 1671292866, "resto": 15056180}, {"no": 15060714, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)17:32:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15056180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15056180</a><br>Applied last year to four schools.

The last few weeks I&#039;ve been thinking a fair bit of how to visualize 4D. I think I&#039;m getting closer. The picture in OPs example is a common one, but all they&#039;ve done is duplicate the cube and shift it a bit and it&#039;s hard to see what&#039;s going on. It makes sense though, because when going from 2D to 3D it&#039;s just a 2D plane shifting out to form a cube. If you were a person on that 2D plane and it started suddenly becoming 3D then I think it would look like everything is suddenly becoming wider in your vision. Going from 3D to 4D would be the same, everything becoming wider in your vision, but I think it&#039;s a lot easier to visualize as a 3D sphere becoming 4D. If you imagine a line from the center of a sphere to the surface, then imagine infinite lines from the centre of a sphere to the surface so it creates a solid sphere, and your head it&#039;s right at the middle of the sphere, then going from 3D to 4D would be like all those lines separating at the surface apart from one another, revealing volume between each line that wasn&#039;t there before, and that volume is the actual 4D space. I don&#039;t know of that makes sense, I&#039;d probably need to make an animation or something. Picrel is the best I could do to describe it I guess, so the spikes are the 3D space and the space between them is the 4D space, but in our 3D reality all the spikes are right up against eachother", "filename": "ball-toy-toys-balls-spike-spikes-spiked-rubber-close-macro-close-up-J8NCRE", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1300, "h": 1162, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1671362018286735, "time": 1671362018, "md5": "htSzTII29agu0fXg8Bya4Q==", "fsize": 148338, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061650, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reality is only 3-dimensional because that&#039;s all my brain can experience!</span><br>lol", "time": 1671364923, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061871, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15061650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15061650</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s beyond human comprehension!</span><br>Literal theological argument.", "time": 1671372801, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061888, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:25:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15060620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15060620</a><br>https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gend<wbr>er_Field_theory", "time": 1671373544, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061892, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:27:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15061888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15061888</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This theory is a combination of the dimensional models (A Single Continuum, 2D Graph Theory, and the N-dimensional gender space) with Gender set theory and scalar fields defined in mathematics.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short. The seven-hundred year or thousand-year life-span to which some techies aspire[24] is nothing but a pipe-dream.</span>", "filename": "I TRIED TO WARN YOU", "ext": ".png", "w": 406, "h": 395, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1671325676116892, "time": 1671325676, "md5": "257HYnFqWBcHiyVxeoZntA==", "fsize": 143329, "resto": 15060652}, {"no": 15060949, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)20:36:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15060652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15060652</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why can&#039;t science reverse aging yet??

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

Aristotle explains in thorough detail the distinction between physics, mathematics, and the philosophy of first principles (called theology in his day, and metaphysics or ontology in our days) in part 1 of book VI of his Metaphysics. Even back in those days, there were some people who were interested only in mathematical or geometrical knowledge, some who were interested in physical phenomena, some who were interested in the natural sciences, and some who were interested in purely theoretical treatments of the first, most abstract essences of things, such as logic and metaphysics. Some people were interested in astronomy without ever bringing up topics like Being or the Gods, and some were interested in the discussion of virtue and ethics without ever giving even a single thought to problems of area, fitting, quadrature, or any other issue dealt with by geometers of the day. Even though all of these areas of interest were &quot;epistemai&quot; (&quot;knowledges&quot;), they were not all disciplines that followed one same set of analytic procedures and methods of discovery.

Since there is in the whole universe neither an intelligent force nor an eternal force (mankind, for all its yearnings, has yet to succeed in inventing a perpetual motion machine), we must assume that this force that is active within the atom comes from a conscious and intelligent mind.

Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today. If you look in the Bible, however, God&#039;s covenant was a covenant of blood but the people who control the Vatican today have none of that blood.<br><br>Pope dissolves Knights of Malta leadership, issues new constitution<br>https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/new<wbr>s/international/pope-dissolves-knig<wbr>hts-of-malta-leadership-issues-new-<wbr>constitution/", "filename": "TIMESAND___2Chron1019", "ext": ".png", "w": 834, "h": 348, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1670990429509709, "time": 1670990429, "md5": "AQ9VrCjds3IU5mG2VGDAkQ==", "fsize": 13285, "resto": 15037381}, {"no": 15052312, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:20:40", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15037614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More violence from Debra Bridegan, more theft by deception, more bragging about injuring me, more bragging about stripping me of promised and owed continued material disability support--more bragging about pretending that DB is &quot;authorized&quot; to lie to Miles and I while exploiting us violently, directly and indirectly.</span><br>This false allegation of authorization is relevant to my interests.

It is always predicting the information it will receive from the body. When the prediction matches the bodily signals, the body and mind are in equilibrium, but when they do not match, the result is prediction error.

When one\u2019s mind is predicting that certain aspects of the body will be experienced as masculine, but those bodily aspects are feeding the mind feminine sensations, then there is prediction error; that surprise is the feeling of gender dissonance. There can be interoceptively, proprioceptively, and exteroceptively sensed elements of gender, with varying levels of masculinity, femininity, or neutrality. Each element of gender has its own specific felt gender, which is later explained further. What psychiatry calls gender dysphoria is understood here as gendered free energy.<br>The prior prediction of gender is unchangeable: It is what is called a hyperprior. Therefore, when the gendered prediction error occurs, one must take action to correct for the prediction error. Transition-related interventions are active inference, attempts at reregulating the system to homeostasis, and for many transgender, transsexual, and nonbinary (TGNB) people, they create a homeostasis in their bodies, in their sense of themselves, that they have never likely experienced before.<br>The disruption in homeostasis that is gender dysphoria has its own unique and nuanced, visceral and emotional landscape, which is highly specific to the individual. Gender is not monolithic. A formulation and tool for understanding this deeply personal phenomenon is my gender algorithm (Anon, 2019). Drawing from mathematics and physics, the theories on which we understand the natural world, I next discuss how these can relate to gender.", "time": 1671307091, "resto": 15060359}, {"no": 15060379, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)14:59:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "5.<br>Gender is a number<br><br>Gender is not flat. It is multidimensional. It conforms to the principles of physics and laws of the universe but not in the ways we have thought of in the past. Superposition on a microscopic level means that a single object can be in two different positions at the same time (Greene,2015). This principle from physics defines the possibility that physical systems may be in one or multiple formations, meaning that a general state is made up of all the possible configurations. We cannot rule out these multiple possibilities when we drill down to the most microscopic level.2 The sum of each of these multiple formations is designated by a complex number (Penrose, 2016; https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superpos<wbr>ition, https://jqi.umd.edu/glossary/quantu<wbr>m-superposition, https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/<wbr>quantum-physics-terminally-confused<wbr>).<br>A complex number is a number in which the solution to an equation consists of two parts: real numbers and imaginary numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comp<wbr>lex_number). Imaginary numbers are the alternative solution when the calculation of the real numbers cannot be satisfied by a real number. In mathematics, imaginary numbers (represented by i) are just as valid as real numbers (Penrose, 2016). This is the recognition by the fields of mathematics and physics that some aspects of the universe cannot be quantified by only the usual means.<br><br>Gender is a complex number.

But this concept needed updating, since in it, gender is still conceptualized as points along a one-dimensional line, that is, a spectrum. This gender algorithm expands the one-dimensional spectrum into a type of matrix. It also reveals gender being a number, in that numbers are infinite. The possible variations of gender embodiment and expression are thus limitless. Variation in human existence is, in fact, the natural order.

Maybe /sci/ will be slightly more focused on the technical question to not kneejerk. Crickets don&#039;t even need light; you can battery farm them in a way that makes chicken farms look like luxury resorts and they&#039;ll do just fine so long as they don&#039;t freeze. I&#039;m working out the details of a design that will produce 3000 kcals/day in perpetuity by just supplying spirulina from roof panels and water (the one thing I need to source in bulk) to ~60 growing pods (one cricket life cycle is about two months) with attached dirt pads for the females to lay eggs in before I harvest that pod for the next cycle each day. A little insect animal brutality (lmao) means the whole thing could fit in the smallest model garden sheds available at home improvement stores to stay nondescript and protect from the elements. Tack some insulation to the inside for sound damping and throw in a tiny fuel radiator for heating and it&#039;s ready to crank out the flour in a fraction of a percent of the space it takes to make actual flour.<br><br>And if I about triple the size, it can feed my chickens instead so I don&#039;t have to eat the bug at all. I think this really is the way to go for people without the spare million dollars or so lying around to buy and tend a subsistence farm and who don&#039;t want to waste time on pinterest memes. Just turn sunlight into spirulina, spirulina into crickets, and crickets into chickens and eggs. You can then use the cricket frass to grow potato boxes or whatever else doesn&#039;t work at scale for some spice in your diet. Works either if you live in a middle-class detached house on your own or if you find a lower-class smaller-scale multiplex or apartment complex with neighbors who will help in exchange for food.

Turns out you can derive most of the other identities needed for calculus from that one. Like if you want the formula for sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) then subtract the cosine part from both sides. Similarly, try dividing through by cos^2(x) and you see that you get tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x). similarly if you divide through by sin^2(x) you get 1+cot^2(x) = csc^2(x).<br><br>Now you wont need much more than that regarding trig identities.

And then use even and oddness of cos and sin to add/subtract multiplies of pi radians to those basic angles, and figure out how to fill in the rest of the unit circle.<br><br>You only need to do this stuff to a basic degree so that you can evaluate limits, derivatives, and integrals. you dont need the stuff to actually &quot;do calculus&quot;", "time": 1671385535, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15062457, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)14:38:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15059042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15059042</a><br>I think using some youtube lectures would be a good alternative if you have less time and just solve some IMPORTANT problems in the books after you watch a lecture of particular topic", "time": 1671392287, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15062461, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)14:39:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15059042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15059042</a><br>https://youtube.com/playlist?list=P<wbr>LDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP<br>Learn from here (professor Leonard)<br>Enjoy anon", "time": 1671392395, "resto": 15059042}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15060834, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:42:43", "name": "YWPTS", "sub": "You Wouldn&#039;t Patent the Sun", "com": "Female Alopecia in Prospective Mothers as a More Specific Risk-Factor for Down&#039;s Syndrome and Other Genetic Abnormalities than Age Alone<br><br>As shown in this graph, the spike in the risk of Down&#039;s Syndrome associated with the age of the mother increases nearly exponentially starting at, according to our best data, at about age 38.

FSH enables follicles of all sorts (not only hair follicles) to make copies of proteins. In the absence of this hormone, follicles can shut down entirely and the protein production process not only stops, but proteins already manufactured detach from the follicle. While hair loss is a merely cosmetic issue, the hormonal deficiency that underlies it has wider health implications. For the function of the placenta, this may mean decreased efficiency of the exchange of materials between the mother&#039;s and fetus&#039; blood. Included in these materials are things like oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, plasma, and messenger RNA.<br><br>In order for the placental barrier to perform its task of exchanging nourishment and waste, materials must be transported between the portion of the placenta composed of the mother&#039;s blood vessels (mother&#039;s DNA) and the others, made of blood vessels derived from fetal DNA. These two networks of blood vessels, although they are closely intertwined, are not meant to connect directly. In fact, direct bridging between mother&#039;s and baby&#039;s circulatory systems is fatal when blood types do not match.<br><br>Rather than direct bridging, exchange of nourishment and waste is achieved with the help of proteins, which have to be secreted by follicles on the outside of the mother&#039;s blood vessels in the placenta, extending like an air lock between two spacecraft toward the fetal blood vessels. The proteins act as a conductive medium passing through a semi-permeable membrane, allowing the conduction of only certain elements of mother&#039;s and baby&#039;s blood through the barrier. While the meeting of fetal and maternal placenta is, in most respects, a meeting at the halfway point, when it comes to these conductive proteins, they can only come from the mother.", "time": 1671320620, "resto": 15060834, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15060838, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:44:40", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "If a mother lacks a sufficient quantity of FSH, these follicles, like hair follicles, will not create adequate bridges to support the exchange of materials, increasing the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and in particular, Trisome 21.

If this hypothesis proves correct, what causes mRNA disequilibrium brought on by reduced efficiency of homeostatic processes to lead to Trisome 21 more than any other mutation?<br><br>When a fetus is in the zygotic stage, prior to umbilical cord formation, it is made of a sufficiently small number of cells that cellular messaging can proceed nominally without the aid of a cellular interstitia. At this stage, a fetus does not have its own interstitia; a newly discovered organ system responsible for carrying mRNA signals throughout the body outside of the circulatory system. This system works best in an adult who keeps active and is not exposed to zero-gravity environments. The interstitia, as I wrote about in a previous publication, depends upon both osmosis and reverse osmosis. Fluids and their contents settle and collect in certain areas when we are sedentary and thus, sedentary behavior leads to genes needing to overexpress themselves to deliver signals reliably. This can lead to a cascade of cellular dysfunction which shortens life-expectancy and increases the risk of cancer.<br><br>A fetus at about week 3-5 of development, being that it depends largely upon its mother&#039;s circulatory system for nearly everything, absent its own interstitia, depends upon an efficiently functioning placental barrier for mRNA homeostasis.", "time": 1671320680, "resto": 15060834, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15060840, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)18:45:43", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "What sorts of mRNA signals is a 3-5 week fetus sending from one end of its body to the other, predominantly? I would suggest that instructions to divide are the most common, given the phenomenal rate of growth at this stage. Every cell in such a fetus is going to nearly constantly say, if only chemically, to its neighboring cells, &quot;I am ready to divide, are you?&quot; to which the other cells respond, ideally, &quot;Yes.&quot; in a prompt manner. A delay in response or a failure to reply could result in deformities that result in asymmetrical growth. Symmetry of growth is determined almost exclusively by the efficiency with which mRNA homeostasis is maintained.<br><br>If &quot;divide&quot; instructions accumulate as a result of a failure of the placental barrier&#039;s natural mechanism, nearly all of the many thousands of cells in the fetus could gradually convert to a state of Trisome 21. Trisome 21 results from the division of the 21st chromosome into a third segment. This may result from an abundance of improper signals telling a cell, beginning with its DNA, to duplicate itself in the face of other, contradictory signals. With Trisome 21, a molecule meant to simply &quot;cut&quot; (perhaps CAS9) a duplicate chromosome meant to form the heart of a new cell winds up mistakenly dividing the only available copy of the DNA into the characteristic third segment. This may be the result of a process of signals and counter-signals that allow for some processes to be halted midway through (the instruction to copy, for instance) but not the other, related process for cutting that duplicated DNA. A metaphor for this would be if the President ordered a coordinated bomber and cruise missile strike and then changed his mind.

The solution was a quota system: each non-western provider would get a few launches over a number of years while they converted to commercial enterprises.
