The need for this correction arises when we measure the distance to a supernova from its brightness because the way we see a supernova is also affected by the universe\u2019s expansion. Besides causing the redshift, cosmic expansion also dilates (expands) time intervals over which supernova light is collected, changes the size of the increments in brightness, and shifts the portion of the spectrum we observe. (A physicist would mutter about need for \u201crelativistic corrections\u201d). Brian and I iterated back and forth a few times before we were both comfortable applying these corrections.

The basic reason why there is a difference is in how astronomers measure distance, which is with redshift.<br><br>If we take a very simple model and assume there is no acceleration or deceleration and the Hubble constant is fixed. If we see a galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.233, which is a recession velocity of 70,000 km/s. This is the velocity that comes from measuring the shift in the galaxies light with the expansion of the universe. If we believe the Hubble constant (H_0) is 70 km/s/Mpc then we infer a distance to this galaxy of 70000/70 = 1000 Mpc (megaparsecs). But what if the universe were expanding faster? Well, we still measured a redshift of z=0.233. So say, H=700 km/s/Mpc then the distance we estimate is only 100 Mpc. 10 times less. So we see that if the universe is expanding faster a given redshift implies a lower distance.<br><br>This also applies when thinking about acceleration, in this case we say the Hubble constant today is the same regardless. If the universe is decelerating then the Hubble parameter would be higher in the past.

In cosmology, red shift is a proxy measurement for distance due to Hubble expansion. However, the observed distribution is not consistent with Hubble expansion because the data shows too many galaxies at higher redshift. The first way that people imagined this distribution could occur was if the spatial part of the universe was expanding increasing quickly as time goes by. However, exciting new data from the JWST shows that the properties of high-Z objects (high redshift) are more consistent with expansion in the time sector of spacetime rather than the space sector. (This was the main idea proposed in the paper which is now called SCP-001, btw.) In fact, I think the secret they aren&#039;t telling yet is that accelerating spatial expansion has been ruled out by the new data. <br><br>(It is possible that I have slightly oversimplified redshift as a proxy for distance.

Its not so that they want to have control over dream and be done with it. Its not so that they want to have control over fake projections. There&#039;s a deeper meaning to the exercises they do. Its because they are trying to understand how consciousness works at a fundamental level. As said in earlier post about Buddhists notion of consciousness revolving around &quot;models&quot; of reality and the models of the models themselves being a model itself. Such that our notion of nominal waking consciousness, consciousness while sleep, lucid dreaming, self-awareness, are all part of the same modeling system. Whether that model is about angels/demons, or ideas about homunculus souls/consciousness self, or some other shits. <br><br>The Tibetan buddhists even have a technique for the dead/dying who are experiencing emotional dread/fears/etc as they&#039;re dying. They&#039;re trying to calm the person&#039;s mind and telling them all the demons/angels they see when they dying, when they experience fear/pain/anger/love are all models/projections of the mind.

So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

Pupils of Galileo confirmed this weather pattern for the years 1655-70 and reported a marked cold snap over the days of the Ice Saints.&quot;<br><br>In meteorology, the Ice Saints represent a so-called singularity.<br><br>From the beginning of May, temperatures in Central Europe are sometimes already quite high. However, high temperatures can be interrupted by weather conditions in which cold polar air flows into Central Europe. If the sky is then clear under the influence of high pressure, the nighttime radiation can lead to ground frost.<br><br>In the history of climate, warm periods and cold periods have always alternated irregularly. For example, from 950/1000 to 1200/1300 there was the medieval warm period; it favored the settlement of colder parts of Europe as well as agriculture and animal husbandry. This period was followed by the so-called Little Ice Age (early 15th century to the 19th century). The Little Ice Age also saw significant climate fluctuations; for example, the periods from 1570 to 1630 and from 1675 to 1715 were particularly cold periods.<br><br>Since the end of the Little Ice Age, and especially toward the end of the 20th century, growing seasons have become increasingly longer and spring frosts rarer and shorter, and also less severe than in the past.", "time": 1675241192, "resto": 15167789}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15168173, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)19:42:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Who are the best science youtubers?<br>pic related", "filename": "1661957064948", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675212151322490, "time": 1675212151, "md5": "T7lfJezmA4v+xwb8UfoDpQ==", "fsize": 108224, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "who-are-the-best-science-youtubers", "replies": 30, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 15168180, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)19:47:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "im trans btw", "time": 1675212461, "resto": 15168173}, {"no": 15168240, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:12:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "this guy is a narcissist with a very fragile ego<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;replies to comments on 7 years old videos</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seethes whenever someone points out he is not a professor</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes debunk videos as if the 0.0001% of people who still believe in flat earth are going to be convinced by someone reading abstracts of advanced physics papers none of them can understand</span><br><br>organic chemistry chad, 3b1b, blackpenredpen, Trefor Bazett and khan academy are way better for undergrad stuff. those are the ones that actually focus on teaching uni course material and go through examples", "time": 1675213933, "resto": 15168173}, {"no": 15168243, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168240</a><br>It&#039;s even worse than that.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients.

Then there comes the various view points world wide on just which axioms of history are indeed valid to them. It&#039;d be a bureaucratic nightmare to have just western, islamic, indian, and chinese historians come together and meet on this very topic much less dish out actual universal rules. Now imagine pulling that off for all of humanity. Just for reference there are over a 1000 languages and ethnicities in just Africa, India and dozens in China alone. The middle east might be easier due to ethnic absorption into either an arab, iranian or turkic ethnicity with a few outliers, then comes europe, North and south america along with oceania. That task requires just looking at all those region&#039;s historic patterns and then attempting to find implicit generalities that are seen across all those thousands of ethnicities from various regions. Also remember many historically relevant ethnic groups no longer exist or were wiped out over centuries ago. The data needed for gathering and processing is simply to large.

The presence of large quantities of proteins which act a bit like anti-freeze in these special cells mean that preservation of these particular cells by freezing is possible. In these cases, interestingly, unusually low temperatures are required. Even when these cells are in a frozen state, their entropy does not entirely cease. Sperm cells, for instance, must be preserved at -80\u00b0F or below for long-term viability. While this fact about protecting reproductive cells is well-known, no one seems to be asking why it is the case that harmful entropy occurs at temperatures higher than -80\u00b0F. In solving the mystery as to why this is so, I have answered a question about entropy generally, and the aging process, more specifically.<br><br>If entropy is not entirely halted by the state or condition of fluids being locked into a lattice structure i.e. being in the frozen state, in what dimension can a molecule move when its position relative to other molecules is fixed?

Add to this the possibility of the molecule twisting on its own axis gradually and it becomes possible for a hydrogen to be kicked off of the water molecule upon thawing. Ordinarily, hydrogens in water tend to be liganded at an orientation of 104.45\u00b0 of angle relative to their associated oxygens. As previously hypothesized, grabbing these hydrogens with Coulomb lines and abruptly changing their orientation relative to one another would have the potential to kick a hydrogen off of the molecule, meaning that such a technique (when dealing with liquid) could be used to efficiently harvest hydrogen.<br><br>If this can be true for liquid water in an artificial hydrolysis mechanism, it stands to reason that this sort of dehydrogenation process could be transpiring on a sporadic basis naturally in both frozen and liquid biological tissues and could underpin a key aspect of the aging process.<br><br>In lipid structures such as cellular and nuclear membranes, chains of proteins are interlinked ultimately by covalent electron bonds between water and other molecules comprising the proteins.

If DNA attempts to pass through such a membrane at a point in that proverbial chain link fence where a link is missing a hydrogen, the fence will not perform its task of allowing the transport of the DNA, slowing the healing process and further damaging the membrane in one fell swoop.

Since senescent cells must copy their own DNA to facilitate replication about 5x as often as healthy cells, in this author&#039;s view, the paradox of senescent cells&#039; higher risk of carcinogenesis despite a slower apparent rate of replication can be explained by this higher level of activity in the nucleus.<br><br>Recent experimental therapies have purportedly been effective in reversing cell senescence. I would propose that the as-yet unknown mechanism underpinning these treatments must fundamentally work by introducing free hydrogen ions to the nuclear membrane with those hydrogens linking up with hydrogen monoxides and restoring them to their original status as standard water. These therapies, although promising, are incomplete, both because the wrinkling of the nuclear membranes would not be entirely &quot;ironed out&quot; by rehydrogenization alone and because aging is a multifaceted process.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative. Poor people lead an existence in perpetual captivity to their employers and hold no agency and such an existence is a lifelong experience of the hypothetical week posited.

If I don&#039;t sleep for a few days I start to hallucinate and my brain shuts down and I can only walk, jump, sit etc. and give minor descriptions and my ability to communicate my thoughts to other people becomes extremely limited. While on Latuda I noticed that I can&#039;t just take it with milk, unless I have eaten a Normal plate of food soon enough. Desyrel (trazodone) increases the quality of my mood, usually at night when sometimes I have planned to sleep and listen to mp3 music without becoming easily depressed. Doing push ups certainly helps. Since I started doing push ups and compared to when I was last doing a very high number of them (about 500,000 a day really fast in about 1.5 hours) I think the medication is best on 1. Normal plate of food AND exercise 2. Planning 3. No logistical compromises. I&#039;m interested in Risperdal since it might be an &quot;easy&quot; medication where I can just drink caffeinated coffee in the morning and &quot;do whatever I want.&quot; Zyprexa is similar however I think it&#039;s best used in College graduate adults not those in community college etc. I do research for a living and have solved several important problems, applied by many state and federal governments worldwide.

Then you can put all the Maid Time Rectangles together and get a Maid Time Cube.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what shape you get when you put all the Maid Time Cubes together, but it can I guess be thought of as a 3D Maid Space that changes with time?<br><br>I don&#039;t know even how to consider more than four because somehow time has to have a shape first and I don&#039;t know how even to consider dimensions bigger than four.<br><br>I couldn&#039;t really tell it is supposed to be a shell because the color scheme for the tail to too similar.<br><br>There also aren&#039;t many Yachies I have. I didn&#039;t know this character existed but someone made a thread with a huge boobs Yachie who sort of resembled Tohru, and Touhou was in the file name so I think maybe Yachie is the big titty dra/g/on maid I am hoping for. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that I can find Maid Yachie or huge boobs Yachie, but not both at the same time.

The company would hire people, teach them about every part of a rocket, and then watch them leave because Masten didn\u2019t pay them enough or they couldn\u2019t stand living in a remote town in the desert. Brockert, Garcia, and a Masten intern named Mike Judson all eventually moved to Astra Space, a rocket maker that recently reached orbit. Another intern, Tim Ellis, went to Blue Origin and later co-founded his own company, Relativity Space, which is using 3D-printing technology to build entire rockets. Goff also left, in 2010, to start Altius Space Machines, Inc., an aerospace company.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But then Covid hit, and Masten started announcing delays to the project. The pandemic-induced supply chain issues blamed for the slowdown forced the company to manufacture parts in-house that it had expected to buy. As costs rose, Masten started burning through cash at an unsustainable rate. It tried to raise money from investors but could find no takers. In July it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It either laid off or furloughed the majority of its employees, leaving at least some possibility of a last-ditch comeback.

You get 200 square kilometers per billion tons, not 20.<br>It would be pretty infeasible to launch a billion tons of steel into orbit from Earth, sure. It would be far easier to launch that mass into Lunar orbit. Easier yet if the thing doing the launching is an electromagnetic track instead of a rocket. The easiest way though would be to pull material from an asteroid, which could be done in gigantic quantity for minimal energy costs. In fact the supermajority of the energy budget associated with building O&#039;Neill cylinders from asteroids goes to refining the materials. Getting the materials in the first place is almost free. <br>Bennu, the smallest asteroid we&#039;ve ever visited, is only about 500 meters wide, yet masses 78 million tons. If 20% of that asteroid&#039;s mass is iron and carbon in the correct ratios for making steel, then from Bennu alone we could build a habitat with over three million square meters of habitable area inside. If instead we used the steel to make an airtight inner liner which was wrapped with basalt fibers extruded from the remaining rocky mass of Bennu, then we&#039;d have a 15.6 square kilometer habitat.<br>Meanwhile Ryugu, which looks like Bennu but bigger, would supply us with 90 square kilometers. <br>Eros would supply us with 200,000 square kilometers as O&#039;Neill cylinders, and it&#039;s not even the biggest near earth asteroid, let alone the biggest asteroid in general. That&#039;s roughly equal to the area of Britain. <br>The only issue with orbital spin habitats really is that we currently don&#039;t have a space industry to build them with.
