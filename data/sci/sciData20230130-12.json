Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

A particular matrix M is an n x m matrix. I&#039;d like to estimate the function f, whose domain is R^m. I can assume that [math]f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i(x_i)[/math] and that [math]f_i(0) = 0[/math] for any i. For each matrix M, I can direcrly observe the value [math]F(M) = \\sum_{i} f(M_i)[/math] where M_i is the ith row of the matrix. Given an unseen matrix X along with [math]\\sum_{i} f(X_i)[/math], I&#039;d like to predict f(X_i) for each row of X. I first thought it was impossible, but I thought about this example - if I have two matrices A and B that are identical (or at least very similar) except at one element [math]A_{ij} \\neq B_{ij}[/math], then [math]F(A) - F(B) = f_j(A_{ij}) - f_j(B_{ij})[/math]. If [math]A_{ij}[/math] or [math]B_{ij}[/math] happen to be 0, then I know the value of [math]f_j[/math] at the nonzero one.

Names for beings include gods, demons, angels, faeries, djinn, and others. It is noted the consciousness field is a singularity and can be construed as god himself.

Vimana have been documented historically by the hindu scriptures and include knowledge of pressurized mercury.

Self-reference generally results in paradox because it is simply incoherent. So when you say that we are conscious of our consciousness, or whatever, you should be really precise in what you mean. I can close my eyes, and notice the lack of visual stimuli that I normally see. Likewise I can close my ears, hold my nose, etc. I can also be conscious of the fact that time passes when I\u2019m asleep, and yet I have no memories of any conscious stimuli when I \u2018m asleep. This leads me to the realization that sometimes I am conscious, and sometimes not. Even to say \u201cI am conscious\u201d is not much different than saying \u201cI am aware of the fact that I see a tree and hear birds when I could be seeing nothing and hearing nothing at all.\u201d So I don\u2019t get this emphasis on consciousness being conscious of itself, as if it is some sort of infinite mirror loop or something.

See pic, especially my favorite part, here<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is now overwhelming biological and behavioral evidence that the brain contains no stable, high-resolution, full field representation of a visual scene, even though that is what we subjectively experience (Martinez-Conde et al. 2008). The structure of the primate visual system has been mapped in detail (Kaas and Collins 2003) and there is no area that could encode this detailed information.</span><br>The subjective experience is thus inconsistent with the neural circuitry. This is just the visual binding problem by the way, there are many more.<br>Note: Notice they don&#039;t say &#039;the circuitry hasn&#039;t yet been found&#039;. The whole thing has been ALREADY BEEN MAPPED. Subjective experience is INCONSISTENT WITH NEURAL CIRCUITRY. So there is no one to one correspondence between brain and mind. So any &#039;physicalism of the gaps&#039; model fails. Any appeal to a one to one mapping some day FAILS. The computational theory of mind FAILS to account for consciousness. Computation is ONE of the things that consciousness DOES, as well as reasoning. We also already know that humans minds can harness computation to mimic some of the things that their own consciousnesses DO, but this says nothing about creating an experiencer to experience such experiences. You can&#039;t do that . A piece of virtual meat in spacetime is not the seat of consciousness and software created BY consciousnesses (that&#039;s what AI is) immersed in a VR is also NOT the seat of a consciousness either. This piece of meat you think creates consciousness never even needs to beed rendered ie have defined measurements in spacetime unless measured/observed, at which time what is probable to be there will be there, the same as with all matter.

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right.

Here are the rules. Two players alternate turns with black going first. Each turn consists of two phases. First the attack phase, then the maneuver phase. During the attack phase you can choose to attack any number of your opponents pieces. If you attack an enemy piece your opponents can choose to defend it. In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board. This is done by pulling the twine taught above the board. In other words there must be a straight line connecting the piece to each side of the board for it to be defended.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative. Poor people lead an existence in perpetual captivity to their employers and hold no agency and such an existence is a lifelong experience of the hypothetical week posited.

It has been known since antiquity as the astral plane, heaven, hell, and sheol. It was documented by the army in the gateway process as a holographic torus. Tesla knew about hyperspace and invented zero-point energy and scalar waves. The original maxwell equations were also hyperdimensional. Current literature on consciousness also describes a torus hyperfield. Telepathy is instantaneous and across space and time. Consciousness masters throughout time have used this field to manipulate reality. There are many accounts of levitation, astral projection, teleportation, non-locality, telepathy, and manifestation. UFOs and interdimensional beings have also been documented throughout history as objects in the sky and strange interactions. Names for beings include gods, demons, angels, faeries, djinn, and others. It is noted the consciousness field is a singularity and can be construed as god himself. In modern times, world war 2 is thought to have allowed the creation of anti-gravity and zero-point energy by the axis. Vimana may have been retrieved. Vimana have been documented historically by the hindu scriptures and include knowledge of pressurized mercury. Many extraterrestrial craft were spotted during world war 2 and identified as foo fighters, balls of light. Craft were downed by scalar wave weapons, including roswell. Alien bodies were recovered. Technology was reverse engineered. Such technology includes anti-gravity, kevlar fabric, and integrated circuits. Bob Lazar may have witnessed an alien craft and noted it was a single piece, indicating it was manifested upon manufacture using the transdimensional consciousness field. Victor from the alien interview documentary in 1997 provided footage of a supposed alien leaked from the department of navy intelligence. It may have been a black project robot.", "time": 1675026294, "resto": 15162223}, {"no": 15163187, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15163178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15163178</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/x/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/x/</a>", "time": 1675026313, "resto": 15162223}, {"no": 15163189, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:05:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15163185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15163185</a><br>The kgb released footage of a greyling being dissected.

He also claims to have seen a short alien surrounded by a toroidal field, a humanlike alien, and an invisible alien who teleported him onto a ship. A recent disclosure witness from boeing noted the humanlike aliens are known as &quot;the orange.&quot; Synthetic telepathy has been in development since world war 2 when the frey effect was discovered. It was later updated to include radar EEG pings to read brain waves remotely. It is all AI encoding and decoding now, and involves hyperdimensional scalar waves. The nsa spies on aliens in their homeworlds and no SCIF is secure. Dr. Robert Duncan is a cia whistleblower who worked on such systems and has revealed many details of the technology used on targeted individuals. A us navy special operations disclosure document was released in 2013 and 2014 that documents the overall operations of these systems. It also includes synthetic timelines, teleportation, manifestation cloning, total weather microcontrol, remote force fields, cosmic ascension, non-linear spacetime generation, and contact with guardian angel interdimensional beings. This system or a similar extraterrestrial system was used on former marine kyle odom. He documented his astral projection experience, the apparent possession of people around him, telepathic interactions, remote manifestations or teleportations of objects, timeline switching, and the strange ballistics of the man he tried to kill who survived somehow and became a politician.

The trick would be to send out unmanned vehicles with the equipment to mine and refine water into hydrolox at one of Jupiter&#039;s outer irregular moons, then follow up with crew to set things up and get a propellant source operating in system. From that outer moon you&#039;d then drop in towards Callisto and set up surface ISRU there as well.

It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.<br><br>[2021]<br>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2021.06.01.446676v1<br>SARS-CoV-2 Infects Syncytiotrophoblast and Activates Inflammatory Responses in the Placenta<br>Argueta et al<br><br>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2021.01.25.21250452v1<br>SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with robust inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface<br>Lu-Culligan et al<br><br>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2021.02.04.429815v1<br>Activin A correlates with the worst outcomes in COVID-19 patients, and can be induced by cytokines via the IKK/NF-kappa B pathway<br>McAleavy et al", "time": 1674822505, "resto": 15157360}, {"no": 15157429, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:29:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157427</a><br><br>https://academic.oup.com/humrep/art<wbr>icle/36/4/899/6042696<br>Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the first trimester placenta leading to transplacental transmission and fetal demise from an asymptomatic mother<br>Shende et al<br>These results imply that the virus persisted in the placental tissue weeks after it was cleared from the pulmonary passage.<br><br>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2021.04.23.21255940v1<br>The impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on antibody responses in the general population in the United Kingdom<br>Burt et al<br><br>[2022]<br>https://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.<wbr>com/2022/03/why-are-ukhsa-obfuscati<wbr>ng-data-on.html<br>Why are UKHSA obfuscating data on stillbirths by vaccine status: just another statistical illusion?<br>Martin Neil, Norman Fenton<br>women vaccinated prior to pregnancy are included in &quot;no doses in pregnancy&quot;.<br><br>[MALE INFERTILITY - testes]<br>[2021]<br>https://archive.vn/Fh0RY<br>Testicular Atrophy and Hypothalamic Pathology in SARS-2: Possibility of the Incidence of Male Infertility and HPG Axis Abnormalities<br>Selvaraj et al<br><br>[2022]<br>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2021.12.30.474613v1<br>Nonself Mutations in the Spike Protein Suggest an Increase in the Antigenicity and a Decrease in the Virulence of the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2<br>Otaki et al<br><br>https://www.researchgate.net/public<wbr>ation/358432038_SARS-CoV-2_infects_<wbr>replicates_elevates_angiotensin_II_<wbr>and_activates_immune_cells_1_in_hum<wbr>an_testes<br>SARS-CoV-2 infects, replicates, elevates angiotensin II and activates immune cells 1 in human testes<br>Costa et al<br><br>*SARS-CoV-2 antigens eat your testes:<br>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.<wbr>1101/2022.09.21.508904v1<br>In vitro evidence against productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of human testicular cells: Bystander effects of infection mediate testicular injury.<br>Giannakopoulos et al<br><br><br>all papers:<br>https://textup.fr/651090GH", "time": 1674822566, "resto": 15157360}, {"no": 15157442, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157423</a><br>don&#039;t forget how even unvaxxed women were induced to have abortions by the vaxxoes shedding around them", "time": 1674822879, "resto": 15157360}, {"no": 15157450, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:38:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157442</a><br>*miscarry", "time": 1674823081, "resto": 15157360}, {"no": 15157456, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:40:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157429</a><br>and I forgot these two:<br><br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC9554221/<br>SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, stillbirth, and maternal COVID-19 vaccination: clinical\u2013pathologic correlations<br>Schwartz et al<br>SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, can cause severe and diffuse placental parenchymal destruction that can affect greater than 75% of the placenta, effectively rendering the placenta incapable of performing its function of oxygenating the fetus and leading to stillbirth and neonatal death via malperfusion and placental insufficiency<br><br><br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/362<wbr>39937/<br>Association Between Time Interval from COVID-19 Vaccination to In Vitro Fertilization and Pregnancy Rate After Fresh Embryo Transfer<br>Shi et al<br>Ongoing pregnancy was significantly lower in the 30 days or less subgroup (34.3% [12 of 35];

But qualia is still a philosophical idea. It rests on the assumption that there is a distinction between phenomenon and noumenon. It&#039;s a sort of neo-Kantianism where the object impresses itself upon the subject and the subject represents it in his consciousness, but unlike in Kant this representation is thought to be completely subjective.<br><br>Except in philosophy the noumenon was the main part of Kant&#039;s philosophy that was disregarded by all his successors from Hegel to Heidegger. Phenomena became the main point of study because it is the actual way we experience the world without having to refer back to some sort of contradictory unknowable noumena at all. The qualia idea is an unnecessary revival of the noumenal idea, which was abandoned by philosophers literally 2 centuries ago because of its contradictions.<br><br>For instance - if experience of phenomena is subjective (qualia), then there must be a noumenon that is ultimately unknowable to us that impresses itself upon us (Kant&#039;s thing in itself) or we would be confident that everyone has the same experience.

He is literally thrice the human you are (you being a diminutive Asian woman).<br>By all accounts, it&#039;s seems &quot;inaccurate&quot; to say the Asian woman (or yourself after radical weight loss) experiences reality at only 33% the vividness (or other metric) used. As we are dealing with the matter of body, we also have to account for geometric shenanigans: nerves are mostly concentrated near the skin, and an increase to 3 times the volume (weight) does not mean your surface area has tripled as well, as it grows less fast. Say the surface has only doubled. This doesn&#039;t change the problem -- the fat man in a very real sense is &quot;twice as conscious&quot; as the Asian woman. Would this statement not be correct if we removed all senses BUT touch from a human?<br><br>Yet, at the same time, I also can&#039;t bring myself to say such a touch-only Helen Keller fat man is twice as conscious, because the bare fact that the Helen Keller Asian woman experiences touch already &quot;clears a hurdle&quot;. More importantly, if she only gets touch sensations from one relatively small area, whereas the consciousness of the fat man has to &quot;address&quot; (or be passively aware of) a bigger area, then she might be paradoxically the being with the more significant consciousness, because a divided attention over a bigger area reduces the level of attention at every spot eventually to a minuscule quantity. Also interesting how via such arguments we almost can&#039;t help by conjure some ghostly body-independent, floating &quot;mind&quot; that inhabits the body as a soul. But at the same time, how can the mind NOT be this singular entity which in some sense a defined shape/circumference?<br><br>For a fully accurate comparison we&#039;d have to use the brain directly, but my points stand even independently of facts about concrete brain architecture and how the lack of size for such impacts things.", "time": 1675011752, "resto": 15159940}, {"no": 15163079, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)15:24:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15159952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15159952</a><br>Lol.

This presentation provides a new theory and description of what is going on, and is able to arrive at the same calculations as traditional Quantum theory, but by using crude and basic mathematics that any person of average I.Q. can understand. The way that this is possible is by changing the paradigm of the description of the statistical results. The particles are seen to be Independent Events, and the more simple an explanation, the more likely it is to be closer to the truth of the description of reality. The new theory points in the direction of a possible Nonlocal Hidden Variable Theory. Finally, this theory proposes to serve as a possible bridge between the laboratory results and Einstein\u2019s classically deterministic probability expectations.<br><br>After many various private calculations and versions of the same essential concepts, it is believed that the Probability differences in Bell\u2019s Inequality can be accounted for in relation to the results in the laboratory.<br><br>We will take a look at one version of the Entanglement test.

The median follow\u2010up time between first visit and suicide death was 6.7 years (range 0.6 to 32.7 years) in trans women and 6.7 years (range 0.6 to 23.1 years) in trans men.

The relation of proof to math is quite strange, and doesn&#039;t go back all that long. The idea that proof and math are intimately related is likely a modernism.<br>Generally speaking, raw informal proofs are not considered to be &quot;digested&quot; enough into easily manipulatable formal parts, and students aren&#039;t taught formal proof styles like Fitch, so they have no intuition as to how formal proofs might be manipulated.<br>And students aren&#039;t exposed to formal inference rules, what would have to be taken as the definitions of operations that algebraically manipulate proof fragments.<br>As a matter of practice, no mathematician ever touches a formal proof. That work is left to logicians and computer scientists.<br>You could say that manipulating proofs is what mathematicians do, and it is left to logicians, philosophers, and computer scientists to contemplate what it is the mathematicians do. Although everybody agrees that mathematicians demand their work be treated as proof candidates and subjected to a review process that authenticates their work as genuine proof. But you have to do more, you have to demonstrate goodwill when it comes to the organization and presentation of your work; you can&#039;t use your work and the buzz it generates to abuse your enemies or launch a political campaign.

To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground.

We are all living on hard mode because we don&#039;t have the basic powers of concentration, especially in this century of technology.

We need an activity to train our powers of concentration, and this activity must meet 3 criteria<br>1. it must be scaleable, that is, the level of difficulty adjusts with your skill level. we see this in the bridge game, because at first you can just play, but as your skill increases you can count cards, calculate probabilities, get into the mind of the other player... the complexity of the game increases with your own skill level. <br>2. it must be inexhaustible - somewhat a corollary of the first criteria, you must not be able to learn the entire game so that it essentially becomes routine or rote. we see this with the double dummy game due to the vast amount of combinations of possible hands. <br>3. it must have a certain level of inherent boredom, that is, the engrossment must come from yourself and not from the game. There are plenty of video games that meet the previous two criteria, but they are not useful for training concentration because they do not require any effort to focus on. For the young Charles this boredom would come from his youth, the fact that it is an intellectual game, and from the amount of time he would have been made to play. <br><br>Now, it must be something you can do by yourself, because chances are you don&#039;t have anybody who wants to play bridge with you for hours to develop your powers of concentration.
