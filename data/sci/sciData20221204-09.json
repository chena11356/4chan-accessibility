A hologram appears to move depending on how you look at it. A hologram also contains its entire self in each piece of it, fractally (Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End . . . ) But it is completely flat and still. That is a sort of analogy for a timeless, infinite and eternal universe where there is no time and no motion, but only an awareness that moves across itself. Another analogy might be your own body, and how at any one time you might not be fully aware of some part of it, the tension in your legs for instance, or your arm, that you suddenly realise is there, and then release as you notice it. <br>In this way, I suppose you could imagine yourself as if you are moving a few steps forward. You perceive motion, and the displacement of space, the feeling of your body moving, touching the floor, the air, your clothes. But with perfect awareness, as though you were the whole universe, there was no movement, only a series of still points that the awareness passed through, like those old spinning photo movies where photos were placed in a wheel and spun around and so appeared to move when looked at.

But in addition, the researchers also sent a message between their two black holes &quot;through a shortcut in space-time&quot; called a wormhole.<br><br>The wormhole emerged like a hologram out of quantum bits of information, or &quot;qubits,&quot; stored in tiny superconducting circuits. By manipulating the qubits, the physicists then sent information through the wormhole, they reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. <br><br>When Spiropulu saw the key signature indicating that qubits were passing through the wormhole, she said, &quot;I was shaken.&quot;<br><br>The experiment can be seen as evidence for the holographic principle, a sweeping hypothesis about how the two pillars of fundamental physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity, fit together..<br><br>To be clear, unlike an ordinary hologram, the wormhole isn&#039;t something we can see. While it can be considered &quot;a filament of real space-time,&quot; it&#039;s not part of the same reality that we and the Sycamore computer inhabit. The holographic principle says that the two realities \u2014 the one with the wormhole and the one with the qubits \u2014 are alternate versions of the same physics, but how to conceptualize this kind of duality remains mysterious. Opinions will differ about the fundamental implications of the result. Crucially, the holographic wormhole in the experiment consists of a different kind of space-time than the space-time of our own universe. It&#039;s debatable whether the experiment furthers the hypothesis that the space-time we inhabit is also holographic, patterned by quantum bits.<br><br>&quot;I think it is true that gravity in our universe is emergent from some quantum [bits] in the same way that this little baby one-dimensional wormhole is emergent&quot; from the Sycamore chip, Jafferis said. &quot;Of course we don&#039;t know that for sure.

But if you then try the inverse and try to model the area directly, since all we know of the area is that its boundaries are at 0 and 16 we would expect a median value of 8 and if we take the square root of that to get the side length from that we get a non-uniform distribution where we expect median side length of 2*sqrt(2).

The architect designs the building, the engineer makes sure the building will work, and the builder builds the building. The engineer also liaises between the architect and builder. This is analogous to large scale software development. Companies do hire software architects, engineers and builders (developers) as separate positions.

largest-ever commercial communications satellite in low-Earth orbit. This BlueWalker 3 demonstration satellite measures nearly 65 square meters. The expansive BlueWalker 3 satellite is intended to demonstrate the ability of standard mobile phones to directly connect to the Internet via satellite. Large satellites are necessary to connect to mobile devices without a ground-based antenna. Since BlueWalker3&#039;s launch in September, astronomers have been tracking the satellite, and their alarm was heightened following its antenna deployment last month. According to the International Astronomical Union, post-deployment measurements showed that BlueWalker 3 had an apparent visual magnitude of around 1 at its brightest.<br><br>Astronomers have been expressing concerns about megaconstellations, such as SpaceX&#039;s Starlink satellites. While these are more numerous, they are much smaller and far less bright than the kinds of satellites AST plans to launch. Eventually, AST plans to launch a constellation of 168 large satellites to provide &quot;substantial&quot; global coverage, he said. Even one is enough for astronomers, however. <br><br>The organization of astronomers is concerned about the potential for radio interference from these satellites. They will transmit strong radio waves at frequencies currently reserved for terrestrial cell phone communications but are not subject to the same radio quiet zone restrictions that ground-based cellular networks are. This could severely impact radio astronomy research. Astronomers currently build their radio astronomy observatories in remote areas, far from cell tower interference.

The protozoan can only reproduce sexually in the guts of cats, and often spreads through contact with infected feline feces. Infection with T. gondii causes hosts to accrue permanent brain cysts and also induces toxoplasmosis, a disease that can embolden some host species, causing infected animals to seek out more situations in which they can transmit the parasite. Mice infected with T. gondii lose their fear of cat urine, for example, making them more likely to be killed and eaten by a cat, enabling the parasite to reproduce once again. Studies on hyenas have found that cubs infected with T. gondii are more likely to venture out to areas where they could be killed by lions. T. gondii also persists in as much as one third of the human population, Nature reports, but the implications of these often-asymptomatic infections are not entirely understood.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yellowstone wolves overlap spatially with T. gondii-carrying cougars (Puma concolor), the researchers write in their study. They analyzed existing blood samples collected over more than two decades from 229 Yellowstone wolves and 62 cougars, to examine when and whether they were infected with T. gondii. They also examined pre-existing data gathered over those two decades on the locations of members of both species, as well as the wolves\u2019 age, sex, social status, and classification (whether they were in a pack) at each sampling point. Wolves that went into areas with more cougars were more likely to contract the disease, the researchers found. Not only that, but they determined that wolves with toxoplasmosis were 46 times more likely to become pack leaders, perhaps because of the increased boldness commonly associated with the disease.</span>", "filename": "a41cd1a3ebf68f1cdbc75502ec504511", "ext": ".png", "w": 639, "h": 418, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 163, "tim": 1670097437373572, "time": 1670097437, "md5": "ihU/EcdjC7oeS3snLBJbbA==", "fsize": 184584, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-the-hell-are-humans-dealing-with-here", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15029653, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)15:27:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "is this why having a cat gets you much more pussy???", "time": 1670099262, "resto": 15029620}, {"no": 15029707, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)15:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15029620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15029620</a><br>High test inhibits immune system, which is why it\u2019s a valid signal of fitness", "time": 1670100699, "resto": 15029620}], "last_modified": 1670100699}, {"no": 15029252, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)11:40:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Genius of the highest caliber.
