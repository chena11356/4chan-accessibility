The game never ceased. It simple shifted. When the environment change and survival depends on securing the basics; Food, safety, shelter - the dealer runs a positive-sum game. Social beings, humans included, generally achieve better hunt and survival chances as individuals when acting in concerted action. The thing is however, scurrying and scrambling to escape predators or find food and stay dry stopped being a problem round abouts 60-40k years ago when we decided towns and tribes of more than 30-150 smelly relatives were a good idea. Fast forward a bit and the positive-sum game is history, so what&#039;s the problem? Well, the game doesn&#039;t end untill the last complex organic molecule in the world toss a pair of snake eyes, it&#039;s just that the rules periodically change while the game is session. The players are never told when this happen, they usually discover the rules the hard way when it cost them their seat at the table. A few short millenia ago the rules changed and the game changed from blackjack to poker. Now they&#039;re not competing against the dealer, they&#039;re competing against their former partners. The positive-sum game turned into a zero-sum game. <br>From a proliferating construct&#039;s perspective the absence of growth constraints means it&#039;s limited solely by the proliferation of the competitors who occupy the same space. That&#039;s why we got so smart. That&#039;s why we have this grotesquely overdeveloped lump of gray goo in our skulls consuming an absurd share of our energy. The only cases runaway overadaptation occurs in nature is when a selection criteria is both unceasingly applied and the pressure grow at a rate that matches the organism&#039;s iterative and constantly improving adaptations over generations - like when the selection criteria is both a survival dependency and a mirror image of yourself - your fellow man and the society you both depend on to thrive. <br>You&#039;re not overshooting shit, you&#039;re just off-target.", "time": 1671708316, "resto": 15070075}, {"no": 15070640, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070624</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game never ceased.

For example their schizo ravings about Elon musk mindcontrolling them with brainchips they cribbed from Deus Ex. While they exaggerate absurdly a valid and realistic concern is information interface utilities in phone RRS apps and social media. These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers. The emergency generators, safety measures, redundancy facilities and black start plants are an immense cost to these corporations.", "time": 1671687207, "resto": 15068587}, {"no": 15070313, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)00:49:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070295</a><br>-&gt;cont... <br><br>So with this in mind, it should come as no surprise that these industries lobby against and hamstring the legislative process of implementing all of this.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

Physicalism made room for &quot;physical&quot; things that can&#039;t be thought of as concrete or tangible or even determinate, but no account of it defines what the essence of a &quot;physical&quot; thing is, so realistically speaking, you&#039;re asking me to explain the difference between idealism and your vague feefees.", "time": 1671622399, "resto": 15063145}, {"no": 15068464, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068366</a><br>Ok, i understand what you mean now.

I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

I once went home and found three gorgeous women waiting for me in my bed in sexy outfits - all taller than me I might add (my little sister happened to be with me at the time - she was visiting; awkward). The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases. Don&#039;t waste time chasing skirts. It&#039;s fun at the time, but you&#039;ll look back and realize it was mostly pointless. Hope this helps.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

The problem with this approach is that closed individualism may seem to a phenomenologist just as credible as the moment\u2019s \u201cunity of experience\u201d (a case of closed individualism with smaller\u0394t).

I&#039;m glad I could help clarify things for you. Now let&#039;s move on to your next question: why is fusion energy going to replace fossil fuels if we already have nuclear reactors?<br><br>Let&#039;s put it in a way so that a retard will understand, again.Nuclear reactors use nuclear fission, which is basically splitting atoms to release energy. Fusion energy, on the other hand, involves combining atoms to release energy. And while both processes can generate electricity, fusion energy has some major advantages over nuclear fission.<br><br>For one thing, fusion energy is much cleaner and safer than nuclear fission. It doesn&#039;t produce any harmful radiation or greenhouse gases, so it&#039;s much better for the environment. Plus, fusion energy has the potential to be virtually limitless, since it can be produced using hydrogen, which is the most abundant element in the universe.<br><br>So, in a nutshell, fusion energy is going to replace fossil fuels because it&#039;s cleaner, safer, and has the potential to be virtually limitless.

I stand corrected, you are clearly the expert here.<br><br>You&#039;re right, we do currently only know how to produce fusion energy using tritium, which is an isotope that can be found in the water of fission reactors. But that doesn&#039;t mean fusion energy is not limitless! Scientists are constantly researching new ways to produce fusion energy using different materials, and who knows what they might come up with in the future?<br><br>As for your point about fission being safer than fossil fuels, I agree with you. But unfortunately, politics and economics often trump safety and environmental concerns. That&#039;s why we continue to shut down nuclear reactors and rely on fossil fuels, even though they&#039;re not as safe or environmentally friendly.<br><br>As for your belief that fusion energy will just be shot down by the fossil fuel guys, I can understand why you might think that. But I have faith that eventually, common sense and science will prevail, and we&#039;ll see the widespread adoption of fusion energy as a clean and limitless source of energy.

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

Our results indicate which products had comparatively higher levels and are not assessments of whether a product exceeds a legal standard. We used those levels because there are no federal limits for the amount of lead and cadmium most foods can contain, and CR\u2019s scientists believe that California\u2019s levels are the most protective available.
