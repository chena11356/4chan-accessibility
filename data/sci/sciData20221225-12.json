I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

Does he roll two 6-dice, like your pic? Because those will produce a 7 many times more than a 12, and never produce a 1. If not:<br><br>2) If the number is truly random, meaning each n 1-12 comes up as often as every other n, then position does not matter in the 12-person list case. Everyone has a number to go home first, to go home second, ..., to go home twelfth. Specifically, if the boss pulls 1 the first guy goes home first, if 2 twelfth, if 3 11th, ..., if 12 second.

You are clearly pro-censorship, but most socialists and progressives like myself tend to support free speech and academic freedom.

If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world).

The average magnetic noise of Sun-like stars is 150% of our Sun&#039;s. This is important because too much magnetic activity will sterilize a star&#039;s surrounding planets. On the other hand, expulsion of charged stellar material slows the star&#039;s rotation down due to conservation of angular momentum so if this &quot;stellar magnetic breaking&quot; is too LOW, then the mass of the star doesn&#039;t decline over time and thus the orbiting planets experience orbital decay.

The present study used structural magnetic imaging to examine gray matter (GM) volumes among 27 men with schizophrenia preceded by CD (SZ+CD), 23 men with schizophrenia but without CD (SZ\u2013CD), 27 men with CD only (CD), and 25 healthy (H) men. The groups with schizophrenia were similar in terms of age of onset and duration of illness, levels of psychotic symptoms, and medication. The 2 groups with CD were similar as to number of CD symptoms, lifelong aggressive behavior, and number of criminal convictions. Men with SZ+CD, relative to those with SZ\u2013CD, displayed (1) increased GM volumes in the hypothalamus, the left putamen, the right cuneus/precuneus, and the right inferior parietal cortex after controlling for age, alcohol, and drug misuse and (2) decreased GM volumes in the inferior frontal region. Men with SZ+CD (relative to the SZ\u2013CD group) and CD (relative to the H group) displayed increased GM volumes of the hypothalamus and the inferior and superior parietal lobes, which were not associated with substance misuse. Aggressive behavior, both prior to age 15 and lifetime tendency, was positively correlated with the GM volume of the hypothalamus. Thus, among males, SZ+CD represents a distinct subtype of schizophrenia. Although differences in behavior emerge in childhood and remain stable through adulthood, further research is needed to determine whether the differences in GM volumes result from abnormal neural development distinct from that of other males developing schizophrenia.</span><br>What explains this?", "filename": "1671829786414227", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 804, "h": 825, "tn_w": 243, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671844439381493, "time": 1671844439, "md5": "7SQO/axBIjrdWn8oehjyPg==", "fsize": 75771, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "apparantly-a-minority-of-people-with-conduct", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 15074128, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:24:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I used to think pepe was a 9gag tier meme only children posted but after I did a copious amount of edibles daily for 3 years and I destroyed my brain I post pepe with every post I make", "filename": "1660018796264", "ext": ".png", "w": 550, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1671845080048500, "time": 1671845080, "md5": "VhyFeOxJTfLaGbfMBvZcbg==", "fsize": 231166, "resto": 15074120}, {"no": 15074130, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:25:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15074128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15074128</a><br>Sorry, I meant to post this in a different thread on a different board", "time": 1671845153, "resto": 15074120}, {"no": 15076160, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:40:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15074120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15074120</a><br>Chicken or egg. <br>Is it the drugs they are given and the vaccines they get during their most critical developmental years that are causing it, or curing it?", "time": 1671932449, "resto": 15074120}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15075180, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)10:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Rolling blackouts never occurred in America during the later part of the 20th century, but now they&#039;re common.

For example their schizo ravings about Elon musk mindcontrolling them with brainchips they cribbed from Deus Ex. While they exaggerate absurdly a valid and realistic concern is information interface utilities in phone RRS apps and social media. These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers.

The challenge is actually -defining- the language of this method of communication. <br>It&#039;s a circular problem in nature. You need to have a way to convey some kind of information in order to convey a shared language in the first place.<br>Which is why thoughts and emotions have been out of the scope so far. Conveying the meanings of a verbal language is aided by gestures and examples. Say sound -&gt;point to green object -&gt;repeat sound -&gt;point towards a second object that only share the characteristics of being green. <br><br>As you mention early versions of a chip like this would be limited to very basic electric signalling No. What the starting point would be is analogues to something like Euclid&#039;s elements.

Being cowabunga cool, while navigating NPC vibes to properly wield power, and respond agreeably to power and norms and biases. Life is mostly a rhetorical question.<br>Even in a culture of science, even in a university or career... Unless you are privately working at something extremely competitive, difficult and performance dependent as positive expectation gambler, or small time investor, where something depends on actual right/wrong answers, then you are playing in a rhetorical universe. <br>That rhetorical universe as well as humans cognitive weakness (although we are extremely intelligent on paper/ in terms of straight thinking, we are much dumber when cognitive biases are exploited).

There is ongoing debate about the nature of consciousness and how it arises from the brain&#039;s activity, and it is likely that a complete understanding of consciousness will require the development of new scientific theories and approaches.<br><br>Yes, this is a GPT response :^)", "time": 1671630812, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068553, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068534</a><br>ngl, the last paragraph is such an GPT thing to say.", "time": 1671631855, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068562, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068522</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neuroscientists talk about consciousness all the time</span><br>They&#039;re talking about &quot;consciousness&quot; in the illusion sense, philosochud.", "time": 1671632361, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068574, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:25:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068240</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is the observer an illusion too?</span><br>that&#039;s the exact fallacy OP is pointing out<br>an illusion requires an observer in the first place", "time": 1671632734, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068577, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068262</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not conscious</span><br>so now the NPCs have started to publicly state that they are NPCs<br>neat<br>makes it easier to find the living", "time": 1671632796, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068579, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:27:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068534</a><br>blatantly wrong use of the word &quot;illusion&quot;<br>didn&#039;t realize this hyped-up new &quot;AI&quot; was this dumb<br>more like artificial stupidity, am I right?", "time": 1671632867, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068597, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:38:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068574</a><br>Does the light in the fridge need someone sitting inside the fridge to turn off?", "time": 1671633500, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068599, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:39:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068597</a><br>Do &quot;people&quot; like you still run their logic tick when no one is looking or does your state only get updated when consciousness probes you?", "time": 1671633589, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068612, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)09:47:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068599</a><br>i don&#039;t even have to be conscious for that", "time": 1671634022, "resto": 15068223}, {"no": 15068645, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)10:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068223</a><br>Retards or NPCs.

The problem with this approach is that closed individualism may seem to a phenomenologist just as credible as the moment\u2019s \u201cunity of experience\u201d (a case of closed individualism with smaller\u0394t).

Literally the same with computers where knowing common vulnerabilities in code is the equivalent of knowing that throwing a rock on the window will help you break in or how to slide a card to open the door.<br>Cryptography on the other hand is a different subject that nowdays requires both math and cs knowledge to do research.", "time": 1671890109, "resto": 15070172}, {"no": 15075072, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)09:51:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070172</a><br><a href=\"#p15070181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070181</a><br><a href=\"#p15070184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070184</a><br><a href=\"#p15070188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070188</a><br><a href=\"#p15070194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070194</a><br><a href=\"#p15070197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070197</a><br><a href=\"#p15070199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070199</a><br><a href=\"#p15070200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070200</a><br><a href=\"#p15070201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070201</a><br><a href=\"#p15070214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070214</a><br><a href=\"#p15070222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070222</a><br><a href=\"#p15070230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070230</a><br><a href=\"#p15070233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070233</a><br><a href=\"#p15070269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070269</a><br><a href=\"#p15070286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070286</a><br><a href=\"#p15070307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070307</a><br><a href=\"#p15070342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070342</a><br><a href=\"#p15070733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070733</a><br><a href=\"#p15070739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070739</a><br><a href=\"#p15071603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15071603</a><br><a href=\"#p15071651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15071651</a><br><a href=\"#p15072668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072668</a><br><a href=\"#p15072941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072941</a><br><a href=\"#p15073144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073144</a><br><a href=\"#p15073152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073152</a><br><a href=\"#p15073154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073154</a><br><a href=\"#p15073162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073162</a><br><a href=\"#p15073164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073164</a><br><a href=\"#p15073199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073199</a><br><a href=\"#p15073535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073535</a><br><a href=\"#p15073538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073538</a><br><a href=\"#p15073561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073561</a><br><a href=\"#p15073592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073592</a><br><a href=\"#p15073594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073594</a><br><a href=\"#p15073605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073605</a><br><a href=\"#p15073627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073627</a><br><a href=\"#p15073650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073650</a><br><a href=\"#p15074950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15074950</a><br>tl;dr<br>You 4chan nerds always pretend your smarter than you think you are", "time": 1671893472, "resto": 15070172}, {"no": 15075077, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)09:52:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15075072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15075072</a><br>no u", "time": 1671893543, "resto": 15070172}, {"no": 15075102, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)10:04:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15073162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15073162</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;truly random</span><br>There is no &quot;true randomness&quot;

If gross weight and G-forces are constant, decreasing RPM will cause increased coning.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

We would be selecting which humans have children based on their natural properties. Literal natural selection. If anything we took away most of the effect of natural selection and that&#039;s why there&#039;s so many shitty retarded people now. Back in the caveman days if Grug hoarded all the coconuts for himself and made everyone do slave labour 40 hours a week for two berries an hour and was also stealing their coconuts while they were asleep then those cavemen would have killed Grug and probably abandoned his family and they would have been eaten by sabretooth tigers. Essentially removing Grug from the gene pool. But these days we have so many shitty people on the planet and they&#039;re not getting removed from the gene pool. People who repeatedly scam other people should be the first to go. And violent people. Then people below a certain IQ and disabled people. Then we implement an X child policy where we adjust births to align with replacement level. Then we&#039;d have a happy healthy population who can make technological progress. And we could do this without killing anyone, just having licences to have a child or something. And if a disabled person is born we let them live but they just can&#039;t have children. That&#039;s what would be best for everyone. If I myself was excluded from being allowed to have a child then so be it, because I know it would make it better for everyone else", "time": 1671878101, "resto": 15073660}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15072501, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)23:45:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How do you prove that an object is perfectly round?", "filename": "kilogramproject", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 192, "h": 263, "tn_w": 182, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671770720198222, "time": 1671770720, "md5": "kev6d/MGz7qedY+FrwwjRg==", "fsize": 10749, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-you-prove-that-an-object-is-perfectly", "replies": 10, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 15072512, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)23:52:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072501</a><br>By rotating it and measuring the surface flatness with a laser.", "time": 1671771121, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072522, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)23:58:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072501</a><br>What is the definition of a circle from the perspective of analysis. <br>Is it a regular polygon with side equal to dx?<br>Always made me wonder", "filename": "1670560288482128", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1116, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1671771484449439, "time": 1671771484, "md5": "IPvDcxoZYIqFyO6UNzkqLQ==", "fsize": 90508, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072530, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)00:01:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You lick it duh", "time": 1671771691, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072542, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)00:08:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072522</a><br>A circle is a continuous topological manifold having euler characteristic 0 ie., simply connected and non-vanishing curvature.", "time": 1671772103, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072630, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)01:11:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072501</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you prove that an object is perfectly round?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To prove that an object is perfectly round, you can use a number of different methods. One way to do this is to measure the object&#039;s diameter in multiple places using a ruler or caliper, and then compare the measurements to see if they are all equal. If the measurements are all the same, it is likely that the object is perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another way to test the roundness of an object is to use a roundness tester, which is a specialized tool that is designed to measure the roundness of an object. This tool typically consists of a rotating spindle with a stylus that is used to trace the contour of the object being tested. By analyzing the trace left by the stylus, the roundness tester can determine the degree of roundness of the object.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another method that can be used to test the roundness of an object is to roll the object along a flat surface and observe its movement. If the object rolls smoothly and consistently without wobbling or deviating from its path, it is likely to be perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finally, you can also use a high-resolution 3D scanner to create a digital model of the object and then use computer software to analyze the model to determine its roundness. This method is highly accurate and can be used to measure the roundness of objects with a high degree of precision.</span>", "time": 1671775887, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072654, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)01:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072630</a><br>This begs the question, how round are the most round objects?
