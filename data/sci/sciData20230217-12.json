It is fundamental in magnetism and can be said manifest itself in a Quantum mechanical setting. (Moreover the existence of \u00c6ther is not contradicted by any form of physics). All things in existence are fundamentally in the form of waves. You may have heard this as the &quot;particle-wave duality.&quot; Except it&#039;s a little more nuanced. Fundamentally a &quot;particle&quot; is simply a wave packet in the \u00c6ther with special properties of which is it difficult to delineate at this time. However it would be reasonable in order to consider a wave packet a particle to require that it&#039;s expected energy is constant in the absence of other waves and a fairly static &quot;radius&quot; as [math] \\frac{E}{c^2} [/math] or another suitable expression can be used to define &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot; and the center of the sphere with the given radius as its &quot;position&quot; (even though these are uncertain experimentally and statistically within the quantum mechanical models). What I would assert is that the source of the magnetic field is the electron wave packet is a particle and has a special type of \u00c6theric oscillations (likely related to spin) which causes dynamic wave packets to form in the \u00c6ther around it which manifest in the usual notation as the particle travels through the \u00c6ther.

The reason is because the public system pays so little that anyone that can jump the boat and go do private practice goes do it, while the rest of the specialists get fucked over by the admins and politicians that do the shittiest job you could imagine, leading to a lack of doctors in the public system and since everyone feels entitled to get a specialist consult but no one wants to pay for a specialist they screech everywhere when they have to wait 8-12 months for one.

However, even if you&#039;re not putting any food waste in your trash bin, there may still be other sources of moisture or organic matter that are attracting the gnats. For example, there could be small amounts of food residue or spilled liquids on the inside of the bin, or the gnats may be coming from other areas of your home or building. Additionally, gnats are very small and can enter through very small openings, so even a tightly sealed bin may not be completely effective at keeping them out. To prevent gnats from appearing in your trash bin, try cleaning it regularly with soap and water, and make sure to wipe up any spills or residue as soon as possible.

Analysis can be thought of as studying the properties of topological spaces (basically a space with a fundamental structure; we only care about the properties preserved under &quot;continuous&quot; deformations like &quot;stretching&quot; and &quot;bending&quot; but without ripping it, or making any holes) with a notion of &quot;distance&quot; (metric), and especially the functions between such spaces. Within here there will include properties that one can study such as the &quot;volume&quot; (measure) of sets -- sets that are uglier and more complex than one might be accustomed to. Note I am being abstract here. Real Analysis and Complex analysis, deal with the spaces [math]\\mathbb{R}^n[/math] and [math]\\mathbb{C}^n[/math] respectively. <br>Calculus is then a set of tools derived from these fields, which are then applicable to real world problems. Here we have derivatives, integrals, how to solve them in various dimensions etc.<br>As for what books, it depends on your level of maturity. If you are familiar with the ideas of calculus and have a HS level understanding of mathematics, then you can probably move on to a Real Analysis book. I personally like Tao&#039;s and N.L.

One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.</span>", "time": 1676129136, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194224, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Guess how I know you&#039;re one of the illiterates who post frogs and sperg out about philosophy in every thread?", "time": 1676129302, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194227, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194221</a><br>A formal system is just a specific class of languages.", "time": 1676129397, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194229, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Pic related also explains at the very begging of the paper the sort of systems which it applies to", "filename": "On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathematica And Related Systems (Dover 1992)(Isbn 0486669807)(600Dpi)(T)(79S) Maml(1) - Kurt_Go\u0308del_On_Formally_Undecidabl[...]", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 1502, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129451092621, "time": 1676129451, "md5": "IXycNUT6PICtatAxz7PGRA==", "fsize": 402782, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194234, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194227</a><br>Mathematics is just a &quot;specific class of languages&quot;, then.

Relational frame theory researchers have done several trials training mostly children (although I think teens and adults have been trained as well) with improving their relational framing abilities (e.g. same as/opposite to, greater than/less than, etc) with games.

Meanwhile &quot;women = adult human female&quot; is much more consistent. Female being holders of large gametes, human being homosapien, adult past the adolescent stage.

You basically take it as a given that a system of government is just a process of selecting the best policies. But these things don&#039;t happen in a vacuum, and from a realpolitik point of view, this is only one of its functions, and not always the most important one.<br>There&#039;s a good argument that the most important function of a system of government is to prevent civil war. The past is littered with succession disputes that ended in a destructive war or even the fall of an empire. Democratic republics have largely solved the problem by choosing the rulers anew every few years instead of having some kind of line of succession, either by blood or by nomination. Even if a non-democratic ruler would make better choices, it doesn&#039;t matter much that GDP growth was 0.5% better or something when your country gets reduced to rubble by a civil war over who should rule next.<br>Another situation that can lead to a ruinous civil war is when a ruler becomes demented, cruel, or totally unfit for his position in some other way. In a democracy you only need to endure this a few years tops until the next election. If you had to wait 20 years and he could choose a successor just like him, that makes a civil war to depose him much more tempting.<br>The ability for a stupid policy to get enacted if the vast majority of people want it can be a feature, not a bug. I know it&#039;s infuriating to watch when it happens, but the realpolitik view is that if 90% of the country is for something, they&#039;re likely to get what they want either way. Either democratically or if they can&#039;t, by violently deposing you. It doesn&#039;t matter how good your policy ideas are if you&#039;ve pissed of everyone else and now you&#039;re dead. That&#039;s probably what would happen sooner or later to a 130+ IQ absolute ruling class. There are simply far more people without a 130+ IQ and they have access to weapons too.", "time": 1676584221, "resto": 15194029}, {"no": 15207868, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)16:51:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15207626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15207626</a><br>cont. <a href=\"#p15207865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15207865</a><br>The previous post was about the consequences, but even the idea that you could implement something like this in the first place is naive and idealistic. You&#039;d probably get a system that fulfills the letter of your idea, but not the spirit. That&#039;s because the people building the system aren&#039;t going to be principled psychometrics nerds, they&#039;re going to be politics people who care the most about power. They&#039;ll just manipulate system in non-obvious ways until it works to keep whoever they want in power. If they support a party that appeals mostly to young people, they&#039;re going to make the test biased against old people. If the party appeals to old people, they&#039;ll do the reverse - weigh wisdom more than intellectual ability, which will privilege old people. If the supporters tend to be humanities people, the test will be biased towards &quot;general knowledge&quot; and if they&#039;re STEM, it will test raw brainpower.<br>Your idea is not realistic because it would just become a meta-game of who gets to decide the qualifications and rules for voting. The only way to avoid this is to have a &quot;bright red line&quot;, i.e. a Schelling point supported either by tradition or just because it&#039;s very simple and obvious. &quot;Everyone who&#039;s not underage gets one vote&quot; is such a Schelling point and your intelligence threshold idea is not because intelligence and most other psychological traits are normally distributed rather than bimodal.

While a woolly mammoth can&#039;t be attributed to human activity 100% it&#039;s still a good case study to start out with since it&#039;s a media sexy project. Additionally species that are critical to their environments could be brought back just for that, which woolly mammoths again qualify being important in their role at quite literally creating their own environment out of artic terrain by holding back forests and keeping the soil fertile increasing the diversity of the region.<br>On the other hand bringing back animals that died especially ones that died long ago like this might not be feasible or desirable. They might not survive in nature due to being poorly adapted to it or low gene pool or die out again for the same reasons that killed them before like hunting or environment destruction and effort instead is quite likely better spent on preserving current environments than a white elephant project like bringing back the mammoths. And while it might sound good for a 19th british chap to drive a species extinct back to back, bringing something alive only to lock it up in a zoo because it&#039;s not feasible to have them in the wild in real populations doesn&#039;t sound too good.<br>Lastly it can still be good despite of that because cloning research is important but it can be difficult to secure funds, mammoths are media sexy and there could be lot of funding so even if it&#039;s a white elephant project it could still be important to perform scientifically and could be a foundation for future more realistic projects like bringing back species that are dying right now from much more preserved and fresh samples in reconstructed habitats in the future.", "time": 1676387517, "resto": 15200719}, {"no": 15202556, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)11:55:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15202392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15202392</a><br>Plus everyone at the time agreed that Dodos were delicious.

The result potentially means nothing new has to be added to our picture of the universe to account for dark energy: black holes combined with Einstein&#039;s gravity are the source. The conclusion was reached by a team of 17 researchers in nine countries, led by the University of Hawai&#039;i and including Imperial College London and STFC RAL Space physicists. <br><br>The conclusion was made by studying nine billion years of black hole evolution. [...] The researchers looked at a particular type of galaxy called giant elliptical galaxies, which evolved early in the universe and then became dormant. Dormant galaxies have finished forming stars, leaving little material for the black hole at their center to accrete, meaning any further growth cannot be explained by these normal astrophysical processes. Comparing observations of distant galaxies (when they were young) with local elliptical galaxies (which are old and dead) showed growth much larger than predicted by accretion or mergers: the black holes of today are 7-20 times larger than they were nine billion years ago.<br><br>Further measurements with related populations of galaxies at different points in the universe&#039;s evolution show good agreement between the size of the universe and the mass of the black holes.

For years, researchers had searched for something that caused the disease\u2019s telltale amyloid plaques \u2014 complex tangles of a protein called amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) frequently found in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. A series of studies published starting in the mid-2000s reported the discovery of a toxic form of A\u03b2 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer&#039;s disease called A\u03b2*56. Researchers hoped that A\u03b2*56 was the protein that snowballed into those amyloid plaques. But a team of sleuths found that many of the papers describing A\u03b2*56 were fraudulent and contained an array of faked images and blots.

Like imagine giving that to a clueless beginner: Would they know how much of that garbage is actually necessary to proceed with math?<br><br>The reality is, precalc is something one can learn in a week. Nobody should spend hours of their life memorizing and tediously, geometrically deriving trig identities when all of this is trivialized using complex numbers; in fact, that time should be spent studying the latter. Same shit goes for long division algorithms, or a lot of those algorithms in general. Mathematical reasoning and proving shit is what one should train, and one should begin as soon as possible.", "filename": "1655956262754", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 240, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675962387594082, "time": 1675962387, "md5": "cH90gd/VtCZF9XpYpKkRlA==", "fsize": 7452, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15189642, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)12:40:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15189518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15189518</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I judge a textbook by its number of pages, yeah.</span><br>Whatever works<br><a href=\"#p15189560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15189560</a><br>The book is not meant to be studied like that, you just read the chapter, do the marked exercises and move on, and you can skip the ones that you already know", "time": 1675964435, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15191087, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "axler", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 827, "h": 1238, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675994426993996, "time": 1675994426, "md5": "DGnlxebIOkKdO/5HrCdkmw==", "fsize": 94001, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15191638, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)01:53:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15188391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15188391</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kjv</span>", "time": 1676012019, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15191676, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:51:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15187025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15187025</a><br>rip z-lib :,(", "time": 1676015518, "resto": 15187016}, {"no": 15191911, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:19:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15191087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15191087</a><br>Are there other /sci/ approved linear algebra books?

That&#039;s why we need proofs to make extra sure what we&#039;re saying is true. What we can do is decompose our reasoning, scrutinise and verify. Ai researchers are trying something like this by training language models that reach a conclusion sequentially through smaller, easier to verify steps. [Schizo ramblings ahead] One step reasoning leads to larger errors than multi step reasoning. Actually, i think dimensionality is key: consider a simplified model that take the set of all sentences of a fixed N dimensionality X, and mapsbit to iteself. Naturally the input might be the subset of questioning statements and the output as answers. You can think of the model as created a vector field on X, pointing a question toban answer. During training for one step reasoning, the model must learn over the full volume of X which will go something like X^N. This quickly gets intractable. Instead multistep reasoning presents of series of K lower complexity vectors in X of dimension M&lt;N. So instead you flow your way along lower dimensional (probabilistically that is) vectors to your answer. And clearly X^N will eventually always exceed in size than any K*X^M.<br><br>Interestingly, latter is more susceptible to chaotic behaviour so there&#039;s probably a fine balance to achieve.", "time": 1676424505, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15205190, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:36:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15199788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15199788</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmx<wbr>3zfe63ZQ<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S</span><br>T<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;U</span><br>P<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I</span><br>D<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;!!!!</span><br>!!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;!!!!</span><br>!!!!", "time": 1676497002, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15205845, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15191908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15191908</a><br>the anon who corresponds by handwritten letters with Uncle Ted is literally the best anon we\u2019ve ever had here", "time": 1676515683, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15206849, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)08:34:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1676554442, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15206904, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)08:59:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196110</a><br>Doesn&#039;t seem it can fucking do anything but liberal idpol, desu.

Then the RNA in triplets is translated to proteins based on shape as recognised by the 20 tRNA molecules and sqeezed together by the ribosomes. The chain of amino acyds are folded based on hydrofobic nature and is kept in shape by that and sulfide bridges of cysteins. Proteins then preform the houseceeping functions of the cells as well as making any secretions, extracellular matrix componetns, determine cell shape, cell-cell interactions etc. Cell diffferentiation is determined by differing concentration gradients of secreted transcription factors such as the hox genes. This determines developmental biology.<br>The long answer is contained in several thousand pages in textbooks and several thousand research papers, which we learn over years.

The program management had a tough time getting upper management to spend bid and proposal money on a vertical takeoff vertical landing (VTOVL) SSTO concept.

But we were able to write the Phase II proposal for our X-33 concept.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We thought that we had a good chance to win since DC-X/XA had demonstrated that VTOVL worked with current rocket propulsion (four RL-10 hydrolox engines).

With few exceptions, NASA engineers rejected the VTOVL mode for X-33, and like NASA upper management, believed that DC-X/XA was an SDIO publicity stunt with little technical merit. NASA did not accept our argument that a VTOVL was a superior testbed. And it became evident that the success of the DC-X/XA flights had become a net detriment to us. Those flights had successfully demonstrated the low-speed handling and landing characteristics of a VTOVL vehicle. Therefore, the NASA evaluators saw little reason to choose a VTOVL design for X-33 since nothing new would be learned by landing a larger vehicle vertically. </span><br><br>I fucking HATE SPACEPLANES<br>KILL ALL WINGKEKS", "time": 1676634452, "resto": 15205019}, {"no": 15209245, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)07:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15209230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15209230</a><br>Nuke NASA from orbit.

You are presupposing that determined materialist event causation is the only form of causation. There just needs to be an outside the system input, IE a non-physical input, ie consciousness (see pic) as an input device in an interactive computation situation, then you have AGENT determination. So there is still a determination of events, it&#039;s just that AGENT causation is a variable instead. Reality is STATISTICAL and PROBABILISTIC fundamentally by the way. The things like the orbits of the planets with low uncertainty are are EFFECTIVELY deterministic since the probability distribution is as such that every cycle update the the random draw for an input will dictate that the planets stay on the course which is predictable to a high amout of decimal places but there is STILL some non-zero chance that a planet could tunnel from one side of the universe to the next, just as with quantum tunneling.

His strongest pronouncement is that theologians and philosophers have no foundation in science for their contention that Nothing will always remain Nothing (p174). Here Krauss is making an interesting and provocative claim, but I think it is an overstatement. If one uses a natural scientific definition of Nothing, namely the lowest-energy state of a system, then it is a simple consequence of Schrodinger&#039;s equation that this state will never evolve in to any other state. Krauss suggests that fluctuations in the ground state can be the source of Something, but this is really just an artefact of using classical language which obscures the static and unchanging nature of the quantum mechanical ground state. The only way such so-called fluctuations can become real is through the influence of an environment consisting of additional degrees of freedom that, through a process called decoherence, effectively measure the state of the original system. But decoherence will not occur if the environment is also in its ground state (C. Kiefer and D. Polarski, Adv. Sci. Lett. 2, 164-173 (2009)). So, as long as we are in the realm of conventional quantum mechanics, current science supports the theologians: Nothing will always lead to Nothing.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1676478243, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204615, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)11:25:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15204613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15204613</a><br>Conventional quantum mechanics, however, does not include the dynamical flexing of space that we think is an essential aspect of gravity. For that one would need a theory of quantum gravity. Krauss, as usual being admirably clear about the fact that he is stepping in to speculative uncertainty, outlines some ideas that have been suggested about the quantum-gravitational nucleation of baby universes and the possible origin of our universe from them. However, this does not imply that one is getting Something from Nothing. As Krauss himself notes (p182), theories of quantum gravity may not contain anything corresponding in a straightforward way to our current concepts of Nothing and Something. This leaves one unable to come to any scientific conclusions about questions involving these concepts. At this point the science of Nothing is overwhelmed by so much ambiguity and speculation that I am not sure how much advantage it has over theology.<br><br>2/2", "time": 1676478304, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204770, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)13:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15204603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15204603</a><br><br>Maybe email him, get to know him, and ask questions on areas/topics/subjects you disagree on", "time": 1676484897, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204813, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)13:44:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reading a book written by a jew</span><br>No thanks.", "filename": "3967967029", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 357, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1676486647078031, "time": 1676486647, "md5": "t0kLn1Aqt51o3dkP+upzUA==", "fsize": 398737, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204867, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:07:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15204603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15204603</a><br>krauss is based for his promotion of atheism, but stuff like this shitting on him is funny and fair because yeah &quot;a universe from nothing&quot; is obviously complete bs, plus his zeal for quantum mechanics is cringe", "time": 1676488053, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204887, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:14:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15204867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15204867</a><br>Actually you CAN get something from nothing.
