In 1975 Collins voiced to Maynard Smith the view that natural selection could not drive evolution because it always acted to reduce variation in favour of an optimum type for any environment, whereas the central story of evolution was that of increasing variation and complexity. Collins quoted Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (&quot;... unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.&quot;), and argued that if variation must always occur before natural selection can act, then variation, and not natural selection, drives evolution. He asked Maynard Smith whether he could search for a &quot;strong&quot; theory of variation. Maynard Smith warned Collins that he could not support his efforts to pursue a rival theory to the theory that natural selection drives evolution. Collins replied that he thought the object of science was to question and examine everything, including hallowed theories such as the theory of natural selection. Maynard Smith asserted that, on the contrary, the strength of science was its capacity to agree on certain principles, and act collectively to pursue agreed aims. This difference of view with his tutor made Collins give up his scientific career and pursue other interests instead.</span><br>the darwinian theory is protected from all criticism by it&#039;s keepers, it is held beyond the reach of anyone who might take a pass at discrediting it. how fragile it must be to need that protection", "time": 1676236440, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197823, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:14:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197813</a><br>Look up Gregor Mendel, you retard.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?</span>", "time": 1676236451, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197832, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197823</a><br>How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?", "time": 1676236640, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197841, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:19:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197832</a><br>How do you know he wasn&#039;t?", "time": 1676236751, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197848, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:21:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197841</a><br>I don&#039;t", "time": 1676236868, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197863, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197761</a><br>That&#039;s only microevolution.

Then the RNA in triplets is translated to proteins based on shape as recognised by the 20 tRNA molecules and sqeezed together by the ribosomes. The chain of amino acyds are folded based on hydrofobic nature and is kept in shape by that and sulfide bridges of cysteins. Proteins then preform the houseceeping functions of the cells as well as making any secretions, extracellular matrix componetns, determine cell shape, cell-cell interactions etc. Cell diffferentiation is determined by differing concentration gradients of secreted transcription factors such as the hox genes. This determines developmental biology.<br>The long answer is contained in several thousand pages in textbooks and several thousand research papers, which we learn over years.

Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle. We can take any positive root and easily correlate it to some rotation in the complex plane.", "time": 1675649901, "resto": 15177129}, {"no": 15181161, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:29:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181147</a><br>Thanks.

What I just described are called &quot;complex numbers.&quot; They&#039;re analogous to a 2-dimensional plane and so can be thought of as &quot;2 dimensional&quot; numbers.

Because complex numbers fill up a plane, and specific numbers are analogous to various rotations, they encode rotation information numerically. This can actually be very useful to electrical engineers when trying to calculate the interaction of AC currents, since they&#039;re sinusoids with a phase. The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase. This is just vector math and doesn&#039;t require complex numbers, but depending on the situation, it can be easier to just multiply complex numbers by each other, rather than have to deal with angles and bust out the trig functions.<br>Quaternions can be used to calculate rotations in 3 dimensions, and are used in video games. Again, you don&#039;t HAVE to use them, but real-number implementations with vectors have certain ambiguities that can lead to certain glitches.

In order to understand reality you need to understand the \u00c6ther (or you may call it Prima Materia). It is fundamental in magnetism and can be said manifest itself in a Quantum mechanical setting. (Moreover the existence of \u00c6ther is not contradicted by any form of physics). All things in existence are fundamentally in the form of waves. You may have heard this as the &quot;particle-wave duality.&quot; Except it&#039;s a little more nuanced. Fundamentally a &quot;particle&quot; is simply a wave packet in the \u00c6ther with special properties of which is it difficult to delineate at this time. However it would be reasonable in order to consider a wave packet a particle to require that it&#039;s expected energy is constant in the absence of other waves and a fairly static &quot;radius&quot; as [math] \\frac{E}{c^2} [/math] or another suitable expression can be used to define &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot; and the center of the sphere with the given radius as its &quot;position&quot; (even though these are uncertain experimentally and statistically within the quantum mechanical models). What I would assert is that the source of the magnetic field is the electron wave packet is a particle and has a special type of \u00c6theric oscillations (likely related to spin) which causes dynamic wave packets to form in the \u00c6ther around it which manifest in the usual notation as the particle travels through the \u00c6ther. If you places your hand near a sufficient strong magnetic field, you should feel a vortex as the dynamic wave packets causes the particle in contact with the \u00c6ther waves to move.", "filename": "alchyma", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 715, "h": 800, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676233604612581, "time": 1676233604, "md5": "OY/olQuQu3gDIV7vbtqHDg==", "fsize": 542080, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197677, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)15:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196966</a><br>You didnt understand my post and mindlessly replied to the buzzword &quot;academia&quot;.<br><br>I see you...do you even have eye, boy?", "time": 1676233795, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197714, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)15:43:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197677</a><br>I used your terminology on purpose.<br>Why did you use a buzzword if you were attempting make a serious point?<br>I&#039;d suggest doing otherwise.", "time": 1676234598, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197775, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:03:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196984</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tell me what causes electrical arcs then, if not for electrons</span><br>There would be no electrical discharge unless the conditions of the medium between point a and b allow for it in the first place.<br><br><a href=\"#p15196241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196241</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why are schizos so obsessed with electromagnetism?</span><br><br>Every scientist and electrical engineer on earth must be total crackpots then, especially those &quot;particle physicists&quot; at CERN who do nothing but geomance magnets around to produce the phenomena they&#039;re all so wooed by.

You can think of gravity as &quot;mass attracts mass&quot;. It&#039;s why the Earth is in orbit around the Sun and why apples fall to the ground.<br><br>-Plasma is a state of matter where the atoms are so hot that the atoms that make it up literally seperate. Most of the ordinary matter we see in the universe is plasma.<br><br>-At very high temperatures, like in the centers of stars, the particles that make up plasma start to behave very strangely. Protons adopt a special state, known as &quot;Volkoff spin&quot;.<br><br>-Volkoff spin isn&#039;t a very intuitive concept to grasp, but in essence it&#039;s consequence of proton hyperresonance in a charged non-Euclidean fluid. These effects were predicted by B. I. Karachensetov in the late 1990s, but they&#039;re are very hard to replicate in the laboratory. In theory, it&#039;s possible to approximate these effects by placing a tessellated Si-Ni-Co crystal under a running Hansen-Vogel field and reflecting any M-radiation emitted through an epsilon-concave surface and then feeding the spectrum through a computer analysis.<br><br>-Electrons in this state deform and rapidly switch between a 3-sphere a hypertorus topology, with a fractional-dimensional form somewhere in between. Surprisingly enough, electron charge doesn&#039;t have a complex Hegel value anywhere in this state.<br><br>-Electrons are very small particles of matter that surround the nucleus of the atom and carry negative charge. When electrical current flows, those are electrons moving.<br><br>There you are!

One possibility, like I reckon they did in the movie Contact, is just showing some dots each representing a unit and then putting them together in an specific way so that one can visually deduce that there&#039;s some kind of mathematical operation going on. In each row you&#039;d use these dots and then add whatever sign you come up with in between them, any kind of intelligent species would eventually get that you are adding them up.

Biochemists or biologyfags do PCR to make DNA then throw some biophages to get out some RNA, mix it up, then freeze it. It&#039;s very low IQ approach with a very high error rate.

A series of studies published starting in the mid-2000s reported the discovery of a toxic form of A\u03b2 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer&#039;s disease called A\u03b2*56.

I will give three examples in which they appear:<br><br><br>1) Toric varieties: In many spaces you have &quot;global coordinates&quot; and the functions over the space can be understood in terms of them. This happens with affine spaces, projective spaces (homogeneous coordinates/polynomials), product of projective spaces (bi-homogeneous coordinates/polynomials),...<br>A very general notion of space with coordinate is given by the notion of Toric variety. For a semigroup S, this is the space in which functions are exactly elements on the semigroup-algebra k[S], that is, Spec k[S]. If S is generated by elements x,y,z,... then these elements are your &quot;coordinates&quot;. <br><br>2) Okounkov bodies: A big problem in algebraic geometry is to understand line bundles and their sections. The Riemann-Roch problem asks for understanding the sections H^0(X,L^n) for all the powers L^n of L. You can do this buy fixing a notion of order of vanishing on X (you can do this by fixing a flag of subvarieties on X and taking order of vanishings along the flag). Using this, you can see which order of vanishings appear on H^0(X,L^n) for different n. This list of vectors gives you a semigroup that depends only on L. You can recover all the intersection theory of L by doing geometry with this semigroup. (This is the theory of Okounkov-bodies and their mixed volumes).<br><br>3) Algebraic geometry of curves: Given a curve C and a point P on C, the Weierstrass semigroup of C at P is the set of all natural numbers k for which there exist a function regular outside P with a pole of order exactly k at P. It is an open problem to classify which semigroups can appear as the Weiestrass semigroup of a curve.", "time": 1676255229, "resto": 15196782}, {"no": 15199189, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)03:03:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15198696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15198696</a><br>Thank you for your comment anon, it was very informative.

You are presupposing that determined materialist event causation is the only form of causation. There just needs to be an outside the system input, IE a non-physical input, ie consciousness (see pic) as an input device in an interactive computation situation, then you have AGENT determination. So there is still a determination of events, it&#039;s just that AGENT causation is a variable instead. Reality is STATISTICAL and PROBABILISTIC fundamentally by the way. The things like the orbits of the planets with low uncertainty are are EFFECTIVELY deterministic since the probability distribution is as such that every cycle update the the random draw for an input will dictate that the planets stay on the course which is predictable to a high amout of decimal places but there is STILL some non-zero chance that a planet could tunnel from one side of the universe to the next, just as with quantum tunneling.

The planet&#039;s core must be suitable to generate a field that protects the planet from solar wind etc. Greenhouse effect must be optimal to support life, but not too much to stifle it.

Then comes all the other wild imagination stuff: life in interstellar dust+plasma, life in quark-gluon plasma, life on neutron stars, etc...<br>So while C-based life may not be the sole contestant, in the grand scheme of things, it may very well be the most likely and most versatile one.", "time": 1676128351, "resto": 15191005}, {"no": 15195498, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)19:47:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There is no other life in the entire universe.

Got it for 100$ like new, it was one of the best purchases I&#039;ve ever did. Truly a bargain and the first time I did some star hopping it was a mesmerizing experience.<br><br>A few tips for the newbies:<br>- Always get a dobsonian. It&#039;s the best one price/quality-wise, because the money that doesn&#039;t get spent in a flimsy mount, actually goes to the telescope itself. Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

It won&#039;t be as good as the porn or the fleshlight, ever, because real women aren&#039;t like porn or fleshlights. What you want is the experience of GETTING TO the sex, and the reassurance that you could do it again, at will. This is what your genetic code is driving you to do.<br><br>So OP is partially right, that sexbots aren&#039;t the answer. They can&#039;t provide you with the conquest, only the same mechanical friction that your hand or your fleshlight provide.

In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.</span>", "time": 1676129136, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194224, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Guess how I know you&#039;re one of the illiterates who post frogs and sperg out about philosophy in every thread?", "time": 1676129302, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194227, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194221</a><br>A formal system is just a specific class of languages.", "time": 1676129397, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194229, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Pic related also explains at the very begging of the paper the sort of systems which it applies to", "filename": "On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathematica And Related Systems (Dover 1992)(Isbn 0486669807)(600Dpi)(T)(79S) Maml(1) - Kurt_Go\u0308del_On_Formally_Undecidabl[...]", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 1502, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129451092621, "time": 1676129451, "md5": "IXycNUT6PICtatAxz7PGRA==", "fsize": 402782, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194234, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194227</a><br>Mathematics is just a &quot;specific class of languages&quot;, then.
