The Simoa antigen assays for spike, S1, and nucleocapsid were previously validated in plasma from pre-pandemic healthy subjects, pre-pandemic patients with respiratory infections, COVID-19 negative patients, and COVID-19 positive patients [7]. Authors detected S1 and N in 64% of COVID-19 positive patients, and S1 levels were significantly associated with disease severity. Here antigens S1 and spike were measured to probe mRNA translation, whereas nucleocapsid antigen served as a negative control (Figures 1A, B, C, Supplementary Table 5). After the first 100-\u00b5g dose, the mRNA-1273 vaccine produced detectable levels of S1 antigen in plasma in 11 participants, and spike antigen was detected in 3 of 13 participants.

He covers superficial everything you need to know to start with QM, you wont understand much about QM with that book. Why? Because he goes the Schroedinger Wavemechanics approach but doesn&#039;t go deep into it. Speaking of which, there are several different approaches of Quamntum mechanics, or lets say, formalism you could follow. The most known is the Wavemechanics by Schroedinger, the second is the Heisenbergian Matrixmechanics, the third is less of a formalism but involves Functional Analysis and therefore a bit of Matrix mechanics and its more of Mathematical Physics. One significant approach are Path Integrals by Feynman, also you shouldn&#039;t avoid Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, but i guess thats something that comes last. As for QM Books, have a quick List: &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Dirac. &quot;Matrix mechanics&quot; by H.S. Green (He was a student of Max Born), &quot;Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral Point of View&quot; by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe. &quot;Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals&quot; by Richard Feynman. Also Lev Landaus &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; out of his &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; though, there is a newer one which fused with the Quantumelectrodynamic book so beware, keep your eyes open for the older one. Also if you are in the mood i totally recommend the Feynman lectures which also include a book on QM. All of those books are very basic and teach you the various different approaches and formalisms. What i can&#039;t recommend, but will include is W. Paulis &quot;Wellenmechanik&quot; and Schroedingers &quot;Abhandlungen zur Wellenmechanik&quot;, &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Von Neumann. There are probably a few more, don&#039;t know, i am not at home, and those i don&#039;t recommend are gems but only useful if you know german and if you get your hands on them, but they are all rather Mathematical PHysics books so they&#039;ll teach the math behind.

Other animals use it to establish and maintain pecking orders and breeding rights. Since humans are mostly free from natural selection, we&#039;re mostly affected by sexual and artificial selection. The being the case, it&#039;s reasonable that a mechanism of behavior so widely observed in nature, is still practiced despite our increased intelligence, and our ability to contemplate morality.<br><br>In order to better understand this behavior, I think it&#039;s best to start by establishing that geography has a significant impact on culture. I.e, a group of people settle in an area, determine what the most comfortable existence they can establish is, and then create a culture that justifies that existence, while demonizing detracting behaviors, and encouraging behavior that supports the aforementioned culture. <br><br>How does bullying factor into all this? While no one likes the idea of being bullied, harassed, etc, we all enjoy upward social mobility, or at the very least, stability in regards to our current social position. By degrading others, especially in social settings such as school, a bully is able to publically announce their social standing, as at the very least, being above that of the person they are harassing. Most people never do anything to prevent the bullying of another, because that action introduces the opportunity for downward social mobility, with little in the way of possible rewards. Although we all like to believe we would do something heroic when we see wrongdoing, most psychological and sociological evidence points to the contrary.", "time": 1672994375, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103398, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br>It is also unsurprising that most bullies tend to not be extremely successful, and the most victims suffer longterm negative consequences. The type of person attracted to bullying will typically be a person that cannot establish a high social standing with physical ability or intelligence, so by demeaning others, especially those with traits they lack, they are able to create a level of social standing (albeit temporarily) usually unobtainable to them. Regarding the victims of bullying, this attitude of &quot;it toughens you up&quot;, is just ridiculous. While we can always expect negative social interactions to be a part of our experience as a social species, being harassed and abused is not to be expected, as it is maladaptive behavior. <br><br>I think it&#039;s also important to make a distinction between bullying that exists to elevate the social standing of the abuser, and the natural &quot;demonization&quot; of behavior that is seen as culturally inappropriate. As I mentioned before, all cultures seek to encourage some behavior and prevent others, and to the end, social settings have an unspoken code of conduct which is to be followed, or one will face social consequences. And these consequences tend to be focused on ostracization, instead of intentional physical or psychological abuse. As an example, if you were at store, and a person walked in dressed as an actual clown, most people would be uncomfortable around them, and treat them differently as a result, since they&#039;re violating social norms. This type of bullying is useful for society, as it promotes social cohesion, a sense of normalcy, and shared values, whereas the aforementioned type of bullying, has not postive consequences", "time": 1672995147, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103504, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)05:15:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br><a href=\"#p15103398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103398</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t subscribe to your theory if you were GROWING ON MY ASS", "filename": "kevin&#039;s brother", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 306, "h": 393, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673000100981416, "time": 1673000100, "md5": "yCDf5xi4xAJ2xnKwZkXwUg==", "fsize": 25954, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103610, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)07:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15100888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15100888</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think about this study</span><br>Psychology isn&#039;t science", "time": 1673006593, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15105050, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)19:28:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101464</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s a bit extreme, don&#039;t you think?</span><br>I thought it was letting the dude off easy.

It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

For example, the rhinovirus doesn&#039;t do well at warmer temperatures, so it tends to stay in the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 is better at infecting the lungs, but even then, I provided a study where only 64% of the infected had detectable viral particles in their blood, and this was using severe patients (mild cases appear to have a much lower rate, but that&#039;s from another study). The vaccinated, however, had detectable S1 sub unit in 84% of people.

I don&#039;t feel the vertigo anymore, but I suspect my brain just adapted to it, because I still I get carsickness (never had that problem before the shot). I can do muscle training and play Beat Saber.

Even a full brain emulation is just a black box unless you understand how neurons generate mental phenomena. You don&#039;t need to understand the neurons, however, to give them an interface.

This has already been done to a limited extent with paralysed people, who can learn how to control a machine using implants in the motor cortex.

You could show people all the anthropological and evolutionary-biological data on why these dangerous instincts are necessary, but they will still assume they are better off without them.<br>The zoomer generation may be the beginning of a break with this trend, given the fluidity of their online extremism.

Dealing with issues arsing from the concept of infinity in mathematics is just the same as catching flying pigs. Internally the discussion makes complete sense.

You want to make a million dollars on roulette. You can choose either red or black. You can send messages back to yourself in the past. If you choose red you would eventually lose your money. If you choose black you would have won. If you choose red you would have lost and you would have messaged yourself from the future to not choose red. Which means you would end up choosing black. But then where did the message to not choose red come from? If you choose black to start off with you&#039;d have no reason to send a message back to yourself. If you actually built a time mirror and sent messages back to yourself which changed your future that would lead to a paradox, so what actually happens is you just some how, as if by magic develop perfect luck. Every decision you make is the optimal one to prohibit your cause to even send a message to the past. If something bad did happen to you you&#039;d try to prevent it leading to a paradox so any avoidable misfortune would be automatically avoided by you almost as if you perfect intuition.<br><br><br>https://youtu.be/Qd77OXWC1eg", "time": 1672938435, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102039, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:30:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102009</a><br>Reminds me of the thing on /X/ with quantum immortality, obviously not the same but the way reality bends to make it happen as it would have to play out that way to not fuck reality up", "time": 1672939856, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102041, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101798</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atoms exist only in once place and time at a time</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Time is our movement through another spacial dimension</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are not both in the past and in the present at the same time</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can go really fast and &quot;catch up&quot; with the current present atoms in the future but the atoms are not yet in the future</span><br>source?", "time": 1672939992, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102062, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:59:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102041</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;You can go really fast and &quot;catch up&quot; with the current present atoms in the future but the atoms are not yet in the future</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;source?</span><br>time dilation bro, ,relativity 101", "time": 1672941575, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102065, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101798</a><br>Many worlds theory says otherwise.

AdS/CFT shows that string theory and QFT are so connected to one another that they are basically the same thing, and even in experimental particle physics, there have been string techniques applied for making predictions (QGP and others). The fact is that if you are studying QCD or the standard model (real physics) it has been demonstrated that string theory has a real connection.

But something subtler will be done, and this is the most important idea in the book: when you explain a behavior with one of these disciplines, you are implicitly invoking all the disciplines\u2014any given type of explanation is the end product of the influences that preceded it. It has to work this way. If you say, \u201cThe behavior occurred because of the release of neurochemical Y in the brain,\u201d you are also saying, \u201cThe behavior occurred because the heavy secretion of hormone X this morning increased the levels of neurochemical Y.\u201d You\u2019re also saying, \u201cThe behavior occurred because the environment in which that person was raised made her brain more likely to release neurochemical Y in response to certain types of stimuli.\u201d And you\u2019re also saying,\u201cbecause of the gene that codes for the particular version of neurochemical Y.\u201d And if you\u2019ve so much as whispered the word \u201cgene,\u201d you\u2019re also saying,\u201cand because of the millennia of factors that shaped the evolution of that particular gene.\u201d And so on.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

I think the book is readable, and it&#039;s not very long either. The first chapters are fine.

They are a good alternative to eyeglasses for some people.<br><br>Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery, such as LASIK, can correct myopia by reshaping the cornea to allow light rays to focus properly on the retina. This can be a permanent solution to myopia, but it is important to note that it is not without risks.<br><br>Orthokeratology: Orthokeratology, also known as &quot;ortho-k,&quot; is a non-surgical treatment that uses special contact lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia. The lenses are typically worn overnight and removed during the day.<br><br>Vision therapy: Vision therapy is a type of treatment that aims to improve visual skills and eye coordination.

Everything you&#039;re saying makes sense, but I&#039;ve suddenly developed slight double vision at age 33 and glasses do correct it. But despite me living an active life until around age 26 my eyes are still degenerating. I was competitive in backstroke and long distance running in school and in university while I only lifted weights I wasn&#039;t unfit.

I fucking hate it. I need to fix this shit. My hair has begun turning white on the sides and I just got out of a long-term relationship and I&#039;m not going to find a wife if I have to add glasses on top of that. No one desirable is single at 33, but at least I could get away with it by having lots of meaningless sex to compensate for my insecurities before my vision began to blur and now I need fucking glasses. Well, for night time driving and screen reading at least. I fucking hate it. I might as well resign myself to being a genetic dead-end. The fucking diagnosis today has fucking devastated me. The only thing keeping me going is that I know I have MGD and I&#039;m hoping if I can cure it maybe my shit will correct itself.

To be specific, this means the natural state for quantum particles is a superposition of all possibilities. Mathematically, we represent an unmeasured particle as a superposition function which shows us the probability of a particle being measured with any given value of any given property. This means we have a graph of x, y, and probability all plotted on their own axis (or you may say, as their own dimension!).<br>I want you to now imagine the probability function as an actual property of the particle, like mass or charge, or x-position. When we measure the particle&#039;s momentum, and &#039;collapse this wave function&#039;, mathematically we are performing a Fourier transform on the probability (or wave) function. This means we are taking information about a function and projecting it into another dimension. In normal math, this would be the frequency dimension, but in quantum mechanics we transform the wave into a new function in &#039;momentum space&#039;! The Copenhagen interpretation says we have fundamentally altered this particle by transforming the wave function.<br><br>Now that a particle was measured, and the wave function collapsed: we can perform experiments with this particle and predict the outcome 100% of the time. We have altered the state of the particle by measuring it; no longer is a superposition.<br><br>An entangled pair means (mathematically) that we can describe both particles with a single wave function; imagine two sine waves, summed. Therefore, by measuring one particle, you have actually measured both and (spooky action:) collapsed both wave functions! You have influenced the entangled counterpart as if the information traveled faster than light - telling the distant particle to now exist with a collapsed wave function.<br>However, information itself is still capped at c.", "time": 1673059615, "resto": 15103947}, {"no": 15105314, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:55:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15104677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15104677</a><br><a href=\"#p15105305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105305</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, information itself is still capped at c.</span><br>I just want to clarify:<br>Here I am saying you now know something about that very distant particle, so what can you do?<br>Well nothing. <br>Sure, you know something about it, but the only way to act on that knowledge is to convey information about the particle to the location that other particle exists at.

They don&#039;t care that GMO farming destroys the land because it&#039;s heckin Science\u2122 (even though it&#039;s all about monopolization of the food supply and making food resilient to toxic pesticides and herbicides which you then eat). Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?
