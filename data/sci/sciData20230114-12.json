Here, he was placed under the tutelage of Patrick Blackett, an experimental physicist later made famous for his work on cosmic rays and paleomagnetism. This was not a successful pairing; due to his own ineptitude in the laboratory, Oppenheimer became envious of Blackett\u2019s skills as an experimental physicist. Indeed, Oppenheimer initially wished to study experimental physics, but was prevented from doing so because of his \u201cclumsiness\u201d in the lab.<br><br>In 1926, in a fit of psychological despair while on vacation in Corsica, Oppenheimer confessed to his two accompanying friends that he had to return to Cambridge immediately. The reason? Before he had left for vacation, he had coated an apple in noxious laboratory chemicals and placed it on Blackett\u2019s desk. Oppenheimer wanted to make sure that Blackett was alright.<br><br>Fortunately, he was. Unfortunately, the university\u2019s administration had been informed of his little \u201cprank\u201d and intended to press charges, because prestigious institutions like Cambridge usually look down on students murdering the faculty. It was only through the intervention of his parents that Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t charged; indeed, he was placed on academic probation and ordered to undergo regular psychiatric evaluations.

Personally, I think Italy was whiter in the early republic and before, but got mutted-up by centuries of importing slaves from North Africa and the Levant. However, this was balanced out a little by importing slaves from Gaul and Germany and then again later by admixture from Goth, Lombard and Norman invaders, etc. Your average Roman pleb from the early republican period (pre-mutting) is probably somewhere around 80-90% similar to modern Italians, would be my guess. Aristocrats would have less admixture and likely be more similar to the original Romans.<br><a href=\"#p15121985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15121985</a><br>I noticed when in Greece that there were more blue-eyed people (locals, not tourists) on the islands than on the mainland.

Since the least common multiple of 5 and 12 is 60, these two types of people could only communicate math to one another in base 60.<br>Mesopotamia was the first society to use 60-second minutes and 60-minute hours.

Base 12 was chosen for the other because you can count up to 12 on one hand by counting the joints on your fingers with your thumb.<br>I remember reading about this in Mario Livio\u2019s The Golden Ratio over 10 years ago, so I could have some details wrong.

This is not proof that the brain causes consciousness. This is proof that in the physical (virtual) world we call the universe, there is a constraint/ruleset that says if the virtual brain is injured, this effects game play. This is algo (physicality) interfacing with non-algo (mind), just as in a video game (see pic).

The physical (virtual) world is the same thing, only MUCH MORE immersive. The immersion is as such that game play can be altered up to and including the death of the (virtual) body (logging off) on to a new avatar).

Studies have revealed that most HA properties depend on its molecular size. High molecular weight HA displays anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, whereas low molecular weight HA is a potent proinflammatory molecule. In this review, the authors summarize the role of HA polymers of different molecular weight in tissue regeneration and provide a short overview of main cellular receptors involved in HA signaling. In addition, the role of HA in 2 major steps of wound healing is examined: inflammation and the angiogenesis process.

The README explains Maid-LZW and how to use the Kurumi MaidCard REPL to make your own Maid Cards.<br><br>I plan to use Kurumi MaidCard to distribute all my Computer Experiments. The next one will be the Ilulu Number Calculator/SLAM. This should break my dependence on Pastebin, and let me distribute multi-file Computer Programs so the architecture can be saner and nicer without using GitHub.

At this point Kurumi MaidCard would draw it in a square (unless you told it to do something else). I propose instead to construct a new dictionary of 4 by 4 Maid Symbols.

This basic principle is what makes soliton formation possible in the first place. I propose that rather than trying to make individual soliton waves of ever-increasing electron density (intensity/power,) it would be more effective for most applications to have several densely-packed layers of moderate energy density. This is true for much the same reason why a bolt fired from a crossbow has more penetrative power than most types of bullets. A great deal of mass focused on a small area and all moving in the same direction has superior penetrating capacity when compared to a bullet, which has less mass, is generally not sharpened, and has much of its energy stored in the form of rotational energy. Crossbow bolts, since they are heavy and have physical stabilizers, do not need to employ spin for aerodynamic stability.

When dealing with soliton waves, only redundant sets of ring magnets calibrated in a manner identical to the first ring EM is passed through to achieve solitonization can be used without corrupting the wave.<br><br>As such, the best approach would be to configure a cylinder consisting of multiple rings that pulse magnetism in sequence, slowing the foremost soliton wave but slowing successive waves to a proportionally lesser extent.

I think the main reason for your impression is that contrarians and retards are more entertaining and thus make the news and algorithms in disproportionate numbers. From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth.

Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

ML is an insanely competitive field that values experimental progress over science and explainability. There is a constant race to develop novel, competitive techniques, which pushes a lot of research dollars. On the other hand, actually researching ML is an afterthought. People want to engineer systems that converge to (reasonable) answers faster and with fewer resources while running. They&#039;re content to know only as much as will tell them certain techniques are fundamentally limited, and they will wait decades before funding the research that goes into maturing these techniques into a proper theory / field.<br><br>You will make pennies in ML unless you&#039;re among the best. You&#039;ll likely lose a lot of sleep and free time if you&#039;re in it for the money. If you want to make money while being adjacent to computer science, do something like software engineering or systems CS.

ML is not only hard - it&#039;s oversaturated, and the only meaningful measure of success for MANY labs is architecting small gains in DL techniques until you burnout. From my perspective, working on ML theory is a more interesting yet much less popular position to be in because you get to pre empt large changes and trends, but you trade off relevance for quite a long time.

But their shape means they typically want to weathervane into the wind. This diminishes your control when going with the wind, but gives you a boost in ground speed. Against the wind you can be slowed to a crawl or worse. Side on to the wind you will have to expend some of your thrust to maintain course to prevent drifting with the wind.<br><br>Rockets also experience these forces, however the wind velocity is going to be such a small component of the air velocity during flight you can mostly ignore it. Though it does matter if you have a consistent wind on accent as that could impact your orbit. I would also imagine that wind matters more when.
