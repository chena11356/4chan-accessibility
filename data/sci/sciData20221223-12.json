Are dreams illusions? Or are they separate independent incidents, we view consciously as random? <br>Do we claim possession of these dreams? What is our orientation due our relation to the dream? Our orientation stemming from our dream is such a soul phenomenon, as seen in dissociative subjects. Because, it is greater than you and I, this unconscious realm of the asleep, and those conscience soul&#039;s lucid in hypnotic or unconscious states, we can test for ourselves with some techniques and aids of visualization. Perhaps a random orientation does give more precedence to the identity&#039;s independent claim rights, as well comprehension onto endless understanding. Thus, it is linked to cognitive aspects as well, and this perhaps outlines an epistemological first few steps in illustrating the need to call independent states inheriting overcontrol in a resilience they call their own. And surely, the conscience rite is continent now to bless the lesser of it&#039;s magic qua eternal resilience transfiguring the light that densely populates in some numeric thesis of accounted interest, the eternal state labyrinthine of this transcendent inner world of ecstasies. This highly affected ecstasy, though it be real, and I am real in this world beyond the world (dissociative inner world) senses that I am not conscious, rather, I am at the core fundamental lucidity of inherited reality, as an endless integral part of fractal reality, infinity at one.

Physicalism made room for &quot;physical&quot; things that can&#039;t be thought of as concrete or tangible or even determinate, but no account of it defines what the essence of a &quot;physical&quot; thing is, so realistically speaking, you&#039;re asking me to explain the difference between idealism and your vague feefees.", "time": 1671622399, "resto": 15063145}, {"no": 15068464, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068366</a><br>Ok, i understand what you mean now.

On the other hand, expulsion of charged stellar material slows the star&#039;s rotation down due to conservation of angular momentum so if this &quot;stellar magnetic breaking&quot; is too LOW, then the mass of the star doesn&#039;t decline over time and thus the orbiting planets experience orbital decay.

Hot air rises and because the equator is hit by more sunlight year round it heats faster than the rest of the planet. This warm wet air rises and loses heat and moisture until it reaches the stratosphere where Ozone is heated by short wave ultraviolet light from the sun making the bottom of the stratosphere warmer than the top of the troposphere. This forces the now cool dry air down and is why the troposphere has it&#039;s name &#039;tropo&#039; being Greek for &#039;turning over&#039; or rotating.

Sexless/relationships ones are a mix of mild mental illness, low social skills, high negative responses to rejection, and the ability to self isolated. Some could do well to fuck hookers, others need to work on thier social skills and self esteem to overcome the negative response to rejection or atleast help &quot;cope&quot; with the feeling. The woman hating group are the same as before but instead see certain patterns in female behavior and lack self reflection. Women suffer from sex more then men. Pregnancy sucks, sex drives are different, and women can sometimes just never experience an orgasm in thier entire life (this makes me semi misogynistic but that&#039;s a personal note) so don&#039;t view sex the same as men.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

I am using opencv in Python to capture still images from many cameras at once. Unfortunately I have found that the cheap 2MP USB cameras that I am using allocate an amount of bandwidth from the USB controller that assumes I&#039;ll be operating them at 30fps, which means that I can only open 1 or 2 at a time. The frame rate appears to be not controllable with these cameras from within opencv, nor from v4l in the linux command line where a frame rate property is not listed when I run $v4l2-ctl -d 0 --list-ctrls. Otherwise I was hoping I could simply set frame rate to 0fps, allowing me to open as many cameras as I want and capture from them as needed (assuming that&#039;s how it works). However it appears that I cannot open all of the cameras at the same time, which is unfortunate because opencv VideoCapture objects apparently have this handy grab-retrive paradigm that I can&#039;t make use of. Instead what I am doing is opening each camera, reading image, then closing... It takes a long time and is totally unnecessary from a hardware point of view, since I only want to grab single frames from each camera. From the USB controller&#039;s perspective, I don&#039;t have enough bandwidth.<br><br>Now I have bought a 5MP camera that I thought might have more options.

You tell your friend living on the other side of the country about it, he goes to a forest, and guess what? He also finds a feather and a hair in the dirt. Therefore pic related must have been there. And not only have we proved that pic related is very real, we have also made an estimation on the speed it can fly. The next day, you go to a forest and you find a hair but a slightly different feather. How the hell is that possible? Pic related has travelled back and he has mutated during his trip. <br>This is virology in a nutshell.

I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s the best way, or even a good way to operate, but it&#039;s what we do currently. <br><br>My personal opinion on the matter is that yes, the stereotypical &quot;Ideal consumer wagie&quot; is the target yardstick for patient mental well-being in many healthcare systems and I think that&#039;s horrifying. I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

If the measurements are all the same, it is likely that the object is perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another way to test the roundness of an object is to use a roundness tester, which is a specialized tool that is designed to measure the roundness of an object. This tool typically consists of a rotating spindle with a stylus that is used to trace the contour of the object being tested. By analyzing the trace left by the stylus, the roundness tester can determine the degree of roundness of the object.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another method that can be used to test the roundness of an object is to roll the object along a flat surface and observe its movement. If the object rolls smoothly and consistently without wobbling or deviating from its path, it is likely to be perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finally, you can also use a high-resolution 3D scanner to create a digital model of the object and then use computer software to analyze the model to determine its roundness.

Altruism points only take the highest points in a day and it always increase, never decreases as long as you don&#039;t commit a crime (comply by the principle of entropy). The entropy points obtained when someone commit a crime (being criminal) and get to the court. The last is knowledge points, obtained from someone&#039;s dues or contribution to the science field, as complements as the bachelor&#039;s degree. <br>- This system entirely obliterated the friction against the pelf and the poverty. <br>- The tools of the points based giving is named &quot;Penpoin&quot;, acronym in Indonesian language from Penilaian (Value or Appraisal) and Poin (Points). The model would looks like EDC machine in credit systems. <br>- The insignia of this system are synthesis of the psychology and the quantum mechanics from the psi notion in wave function, i.e. the ket notation of the eigenstate from quantum state in a state vector. <br>- Turning terms &quot;the labour&quot; into &quot;the helper&quot;. <br>- Vanishing all of the feudalism, mercantilism, capitalism, communism, and socialism fully in all aggregates. <br>- And many more. <br><br>Hope this system can be completed more quickly in the next few months. <br><br>If you have any question, just posting it on commentary section, all the question would be responded on the next thread.

Altruism is not only about helping people for increasing only their own fitness, but increasing &#039;their own&#039; happiness too, or something&#039;s other new (where altruism and their value is subjective, qualitative reward)... It&#039;s like monetary transaction, but its changing their resource trading with grants and altruism practice only. Points is not just points. It&#039;s not like monetary incentives that make you have misconceptions. The points is to make sure the value of your action is in case of altruism, as instead of increasing your happiness. <br><br>When you give a bread to a rich person, how much the points given by him to you? When you give a bread to someone that have a nothing unless their clothes, how much the points giving by that poor person to you?

Altruism points is only quantized version from the others to make sure how much your altruism value is. Altruism is a subjective value beforehand, and than you know now, how much that is, that&#039;s your reward after helping others. <br><br>Altruism is just about your action, about your practice, about your work for helping others. It&#039;s not about the intention or planning only. Altruism when the motive in your mind is egoism still altruism (because the one who helped by you didn&#039;t know what your motive is unless you tell it), and egoism just for altruism motive still egoism (regardless you tell it or not).

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases.

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them. I don&#039;t have much knowledge about the application side but I&#039;ve heard (from researchers in fluid dynamics) that standard numerical solvers are faster (this of course depends on what you want to do).<br><br>I can see two interesting parts that I&#039;m currently pursuing. First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point. You don&#039;t have much mathematical guarantees as there will be infinitely many equations fitting your data.

Even if 99% of their spewings are ramblings they attract enough attention that the 1% semi-legit apprehensions get debated. There are things that need to be sorted out legislation and human rights-wise that have been problems for some time and will only grow bigger. For example their schizo ravings about Elon musk mindcontrolling them with brainchips they cribbed from Deus Ex. While they exaggerate absurdly a valid and realistic concern is information interface utilities in phone RRS apps and social media. These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers. The emergency generators, safety measures, redundancy facilities and black start plants are an immense cost to these corporations.", "time": 1671687207, "resto": 15068587}, {"no": 15070313, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)00:49:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070295</a><br>-&gt;cont... <br><br>So with this in mind, it should come as no surprise that these industries lobby against and hamstring the legislative process of implementing all of this.

For even if the universe were infinite and we could model infinite quantities, this is still worthless as humans can never go beyond the universe and control it. We must only deal with the finite because that is all we can make sense of and manipulate. So even if you accept the axiom of infinity, many of the theorems surrounding infinity are completely bogus.

This is huge because fusion energy is clean and virtually limitless, so it could potentially solve all of our energy problems.<br><br>As for how close we are to adding fusion energy to our grid, well, it&#039;s still a ways off. There are still a lot of technical challenges to overcome and it will take some time before fusion energy is ready for widespread use. But rest assured, we&#039;re working hard to make it happen as soon as possible.<br><br>So, to summarize, fusion energy is a really big deal because it could solve all of our energy problems and it&#039;s going to be profitable. But it&#039;s not ready to use yet, so we have to be patient. Does that make sense to you, retard?

I&#039;m glad I could help clarify things for you. Now let&#039;s move on to your next question: why is fusion energy going to replace fossil fuels if we already have nuclear reactors?<br><br>Let&#039;s put it in a way so that a retard will understand, again.Nuclear reactors use nuclear fission, which is basically splitting atoms to release energy. Fusion energy, on the other hand, involves combining atoms to release energy. And while both processes can generate electricity, fusion energy has some major advantages over nuclear fission.<br><br>For one thing, fusion energy is much cleaner and safer than nuclear fission. It doesn&#039;t produce any harmful radiation or greenhouse gases, so it&#039;s much better for the environment. Plus, fusion energy has the potential to be virtually limitless, since it can be produced using hydrogen, which is the most abundant element in the universe.<br><br>So, in a nutshell, fusion energy is going to replace fossil fuels because it&#039;s cleaner, safer, and has the potential to be virtually limitless.

I stand corrected, you are clearly the expert here.<br><br>You&#039;re right, we do currently only know how to produce fusion energy using tritium, which is an isotope that can be found in the water of fission reactors. But that doesn&#039;t mean fusion energy is not limitless! Scientists are constantly researching new ways to produce fusion energy using different materials, and who knows what they might come up with in the future?<br><br>As for your point about fission being safer than fossil fuels, I agree with you. But unfortunately, politics and economics often trump safety and environmental concerns. That&#039;s why we continue to shut down nuclear reactors and rely on fossil fuels, even though they&#039;re not as safe or environmentally friendly.<br><br>As for your belief that fusion energy will just be shot down by the fossil fuel guys, I can understand why you might think that. But I have faith that eventually, common sense and science will prevail, and we&#039;ll see the widespread adoption of fusion energy as a clean and limitless source of energy.

The game never ceased. It simple shifted. When the environment change and survival depends on securing the basics; Food, safety, shelter - the dealer runs a positive-sum game. Social beings, humans included, generally achieve better hunt and survival chances as individuals when acting in concerted action. The thing is however, scurrying and scrambling to escape predators or find food and stay dry stopped being a problem round abouts 60-40k years ago when we decided towns and tribes of more than 30-150 smelly relatives were a good idea. Fast forward a bit and the positive-sum game is history, so what&#039;s the problem? Well, the game doesn&#039;t end untill the last complex organic molecule in the world toss a pair of snake eyes, it&#039;s just that the rules periodically change while the game is session. The players are never told when this happen, they usually discover the rules the hard way when it cost them their seat at the table. A few short millenia ago the rules changed and the game changed from blackjack to poker. Now they&#039;re not competing against the dealer, they&#039;re competing against their former partners. The positive-sum game turned into a zero-sum game. <br>From a proliferating construct&#039;s perspective the absence of growth constraints means it&#039;s limited solely by the proliferation of the competitors who occupy the same space. That&#039;s why we got so smart. That&#039;s why we have this grotesquely overdeveloped lump of gray goo in our skulls consuming an absurd share of our energy. The only cases runaway overadaptation occurs in nature is when a selection criteria is both unceasingly applied and the pressure grow at a rate that matches the organism&#039;s iterative and constantly improving adaptations over generations - like when the selection criteria is both a survival dependency and a mirror image of yourself - your fellow man and the society you both depend on to thrive. <br>You&#039;re not overshooting shit, you&#039;re just off-target.", "time": 1671708316, "resto": 15070075}, {"no": 15070640, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)06:51:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070624</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The game never ceased.
