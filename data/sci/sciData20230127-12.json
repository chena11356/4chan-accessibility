I\u2019m not trying to sound too grandiose but Flat Earth literally saved me from a lifetime of nihilism and apathy. Now I live my life as if every decision I make has meaning and purpose.

The molecules of the gas collide against each other depending on their energetic state. <br>2. Gravity pulls them to the bottom. <br><br>3. There is NOTHING &quot;sucking&quot; the air away. That is not what a vacuum is. <br><br>So depending on the energy or Temperature of the gas, the gas will expand out of the inner box, until it is at a density where it is no longer colliding with either the side of the vacuum containment, or with other gas molecules.

If the opposite is true, they will fall. This leads to a gradient that corresponds to the decreasing strength of the gravitational field.

It&#039;s not (just) about fun, it&#039;s mostly hard work and research-wise a lot of frustration, but anyway, I see two main end goals in going to study mathematics:<br>1. To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground. For the second one, we get lost again, because how do we react when we are presented a real-life model? Will we remember Theorem #378546 along with Lemma #648364 can be applied?

In such a prominent position, the wide spectrum of climate opinions is remarkable. Society has achieved a paradigm in which global warming subscribers and non-subscribers are largely segregated by political affiliation. Since science is non-political, only a misunderstanding of the science can facilitate such a segregation. In the first section we analyze a recent study by Cook et al. finding overwhelming scientific endorsement for the greenhouse theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). We find the popular reporting on Cook&#039;s result is not accurate. The aim of the following section is to clarify the science behind the most popular climate arguments and introduce the reader to some evidence that is not widely publicized. Even the astute non-climatologist should come away from this report with an enhanced understanding of relevant issues in modern climate science.", "filename": "TIMESAND___2bQrm72g85899i1qiKKJ79j4h8oJ3Qe2rj903knc0g181qf0De7j", "ext": ".png", "w": 826, "h": 1046, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674733139746209, "time": 1674733139, "md5": "7ifr8i8riPv4MqFaaQNOXw==", "fsize": 329515, "resto": 15154441}, {"no": 15154769, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15154757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15154757</a><br>Don&#039;t imagine.

According to scientists, this happens every seven decades as part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation. A new study suggests there may be a connection between the inner core&#039;s spin and life on Earth&#039;s surface, as changes in the core&#039;s spin coincide with changes in other geophysical observations such as the length of day and magnetic field.<br><br>The study, conducted by scientists at Peking University in China, found that the inner core is slowing down and reversing its rotation. The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the inner core&#039;s rotation slowed significantly beginning in 2009. The study also found that a larger, decade-long pattern may be at play, with the rotation of the inner core varying on a decade-long timescale and reversing course every 7 decades.<br><br>It is important to note that the inner core is a solid ball surrounded by a fluid outer core, which allows it to rotate at a different pace compared to the planet&#039;s outer layers. The study of the Earth&#039;s core is difficult and there is much disagreement over the interpretation of data. Scientists suggest that journalists can avoid inaccuracies by double-checking with scientists themselves.<br><br>Although the changes won&#039;t have much impact on life on the surface, more research is needed to understand the significance of the inner core&#039;s rotation on the planet&#039;s geophysical processes.", "time": 1674804160, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157052, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:54:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15157026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15157026</a><br>thanks for bumping a dead popsci spam thread that nobody wanted to see again in order to show us a block of low iq text that nobody is going to read", "filename": "104 low iq", "ext": ".png", "w": 616, "h": 441, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1674806099297995, "time": 1674806099, "md5": "hPy362RSSEZdiKEUyb15Sg==", "fsize": 170944, "resto": 15147877}, {"no": 15157152, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:35:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15147911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15147911</a><br><br>Correct.

They also didn\u2019t test on pregnant women, yet insisted it was fine for them to take (without any evidence to support such a claim at that time). Then there was the whistleblower talking about severe data integrity issues in the trial. Then there was the fact that countless safety signals that would halt the rollout of any other vaccine have been consistently ignored. Then there was the continuous decline of vaccine efficacy rates that created the need for endless boosters (thus supplying them with endless customers). You don\u2019t even need to be conspiratorially minded to see how producing an ineffectual vaccine would be in their interest because a one-shot vaccine isn\u2019t a good business model. It\u2019s also completely predictable to anyone with a modicum of sense- trying to vaccinate against a virus that mutates as quickly as covid is pointless. Then they pivoted to talking about how much it minimised symptoms, but what you end up with is a vaccine that confers non-sterilising immunity.

Tree ring analysis indicates that as the material descended from space, it spewed large amounts of chemicals based on carbon and nitrogen into the stratosphere.

By encouraging those close to them to vaccinate, people are both promoting compliance with social norms and increasing their own level of protection against the disease. Also, by judging those who do not vaccinate more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote cooperative behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like indirect reciprocity or partner choice, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prosocial outcomes. Thus, effective messaging could have outsized effects on promoting vaccination if it both causes people to vaccinate themselves and to encourage those around them to do so.\u201d</span>", "filename": "UXcufgb4YFXI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 896, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674107349728512, "time": 1674107349, "md5": "B0pAXe2rQELgq/IV47Qxtg==", "fsize": 103331, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "persuasive-messaging-to-increase-covid19-vaccine", "replies": 122, "images": 25, "unique_ips": 56}, {"no": 15135788, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:54:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;npcs respond well to npc programming</span><br>many such cases", "filename": "1657099235829", "ext": ".png", "w": 592, "h": 883, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674107683790452, "time": 1674107683, "md5": "7YWlDlyPl+BmXi/0tb2/Wg==", "fsize": 452563, "resto": 15135785}, {"no": 15135800, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:09:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15135788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15135788</a><br>It&#039;s hard not to agree with the elites on this one.

By encouraging those close to them to drink the Kool-Aid, people are both avoiding being kidnapped by counter-revolutionaires and participating in a final act of revolutionary defiance. Also, by judging those who do not drink the Kool-Aid more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote revolutionary behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like doing menial tasks for the People&#039;s Church, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prorevolutionary outcomes.

Within a given ontological framework this argument is sound, but different ontological frameworks (e.g., ultrafinitism vs. transfinitism) are not directly comparable. I personally hope infinity does not exist so that the universe contains only finitely much suffering, but unfortunately I think it&#039;s reasonably likely that the universe is literally infinite.

Wake me up when you have commercial production of massive volumes of heavy water (specific interest is in tritium rather than duetreum) that is not coming out of a traditional fission nuclear reactor.

You want a low enough calorie intake that your body will start to use fats, but high enough that your body still produces the regular amount of needed growth hormones like testosterone (if you go on a large enough cut, you&#039;ll get to the point where your body will reduce the amount of hormones it produces).

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity.

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right. One must always take the smallest available size of a colour, but the larger sizes are obviously more powerful, so bank management is an important aspect of the game.<br>I found it via <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/catalog#s=bgg%2C\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/bgg,</a> and you can play it online on bga.", "time": 1674648904, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152201, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>Anything board game related with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; ?", "time": 1674649967, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152263, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)08:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Onions (japanese shitgames) can be found on <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a>", "time": 1674652296, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152372, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)09:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152201</a><br>Stratego?", "time": 1674656896, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152509, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>The different characters should have different shillouettes<br>If you disagree, you are contrarion.", "time": 1674663385, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152895, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144090</a><br>Which for humans, is always", "time": 1674675057, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15153740, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This game I invented called empty go.

During the attack phase you can choose to attack any number of your opponents pieces. If you attack an enemy piece your opponents can choose to defend it. In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board. This is done by pulling the twine taught above the board. In other words there must be a straight line connecting the piece to each side of the board for it to be defended. However, lines cannot pass through an enemy piece. During the maneuver phase place one piece on the board. You cannot play on top of or overlap another piece. Pieces can hang off the edge if the board as long as their center is on it. If you cannot place a piece, you lose.

The knowledge base and skill set are valuable and getting really in depth into the pathophysiology of diseases and treatment can be very interesting, but actual clinical practice comes with a huge workload, and just getting used to that and handling all the scutwork tends to take up a huge portion of your time and focus, especially during residency. To me becoming a &quot;good&quot; physician seems to be a matter of enduring under the circumstances (=patients are shit, hours are shit, paperwork is shit, healthcare is overwhelmed in general) and still putting in the effort to practice good medicine and giving a shit about the actual results, the &quot;reward&quot; of which is often drowned in the &quot;cooperative&quot; system that is healthcare. So no hero problem solving miracle cures shit, just being anal about not fucking up with small and big things. <br>There are nice and not so nice things that come with being a doctor, but I like it, it feels like real work in a sense that menial jobs I had before didn&#039;t, and doing the actual medical stuff is always interesting to me.

It disrupts their hierarchical structural organization causing the loss of interactions by generalist species, and also impairs pollination services by wild pollinators through reducing the reproductive success of those plant species highly visited by honeybees. High-density beekeeping in natural areas appears to have lasting, more serious negative impacts on biodiversity than was previously assumed.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abOne of the major downsides of modern beekeeping is the transmission of disease and parasites. Migratory beekeepers move their hives across the country for pollination and this practice has the potential to spread disease and pests not just among honey bee colonies, but to wild bees as well. The shortage of bees in some cases has increased the distance some beekeepers must move their hives to help farmers pollinate their crops and this compounds the problem.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHoneybees may also have large impacts on native plant communities and natural ecosystems. For example, honeybees can help non-native plants outcompete native plants by enhancing seed set through pollination (Barthell et al. 2001). Spread of invasive plants can distract native bees from their native plant mutualisms, which can lead to further negative effects on biodiversity (Traveset &amp; Richardson 2006). Honeybees can also damage flowers and steal nectar and pollen from flowers without pollinating them, which can affect native plant persistence over time (Rust 1979; Carmo et al. 2004; Hargreaves et al. 2009).\u00bb</span>", "filename": "Apis_mellifera_Western_honey_bee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1923, "h": 1599, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 207, "tim": 1674517957377120, "time": 1674517957, "md5": "DSoL6DS5FdNPuFSZX9QsoQ==", "fsize": 2392656, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-beekeeping-good-or-bad-for-the-environment", "replies": 51, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 15148478, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148470</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations, because they compete directly for nectar and pollen. That\u2019s not a problem when flowers are plentiful, but in environments where resources are limited, wild bees can be outcompeted. A lack of flowers is one of the main factors behind the decline in bee populations. Initiatives such as urban beekeeping put more pressure on wild bees and worsen the decline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honeybees are extremely efficient at collecting pollen and returning it to their hives, but as a consequence they transfer little to the flowers they visit. They are quantifiably less effective at pollination than wild bees, so changes in foraging patterns also have knock-on consequences for the plant community. When honeybees occur in high numbers, they can push wild bees out of an area, making it harder for wild plants to reproduce. Honeybees are not a substitute for wild pollinators, so we must protect the entire bee community to achieve good quality pollination.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh densities of honey bee colonies increase competition between native pollinators for forage, putting even more pressure on the wild species that are already in decline.
