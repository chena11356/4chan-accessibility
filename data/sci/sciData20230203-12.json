They can learn, they can remember, its even been demonstrated that they are capable of low level abstract reasoning and forms of elementary language. But if you took the very smartest of those animals and tried to reach them anything more complex than simple tricks or to solve simple puzzles you would fail. Simply because they lack the cognitive ability, the reasoning power, the ability to form complex concepts. Lets say you even taught some Gorillas complex language, so well that they could fully communicate with us. Then asked them to formulate a theory of clouds. They lack the technology to even investigate what a cloud is let alone the conceptual framework to explain it in terms of molecules of water. Well, the same applies to Humans when it comes to trying to understand the Universe. Its simply beyond our reasoning powers. We have some crude tools, such as mathematics and physics, but no one but fools, engineers, and Indian college students believe these accurately model reality. In the really big picture these tools are no more sophisticated than a monkey using a stick as a to extract ants from a nest. <br>Even if you put the best human minds onto the topic for the next 1,000 years we would still be stuck with the basic principles of mathematics that we have today.

Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients. This is because patients with undetected infections would be unlikely to be reinfected when testing availability expanded later during our study period. Second, our measure of COVID-19 ending in death within 30-days could also be inaccurate because we did not have access to death certificate data to confirm the actual cause of death. However, many deaths immediately following COVID-19 infection are likely to be at least partially related.<br><br>The availability of vitamin D3 without a prescription also limits our ability to ensure we have fully categorized dosage and supplementation intensity.&quot;<br><br>they bent data, made assumptions and didn&#039;t actually find any significant difference.", "time": 1675236284, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>I looked in the astroturfed zinc and quercitin recommendation to prevent covid.<br>It is all the same.<br>Does nothing and is potentially toxic.", "time": 1675271931, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169874, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>Thoughts on taking 10,000 IU vitamin D daily?

Hospital staff reported that the children were more social, alert, and talkative while feverish.1 When their fevers faded, so did those behavioral improvements.

In a new study, a research team including Ms. Grzadzinski and Dr. Lord described the characteristics of youth who are most likely to experience the fever effect. The team examined data from 2,152 children with autism who participated in the Simons Simplex Collection research project. Parents of 362 children, or 17 percent, reported that their sons or daughters had experienced the fever effect. As a group, those children also had lower nonverbal cognitive skills, less language, and more repetitive behaviors than the children who did not experience the fever effect.</span><br><a href=\"#p15172039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15172039</a><br>Ritalin is not an amphetamine, smoothbrain.", "time": 1675364893, "resto": 15171563}, {"no": 15172384, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:12:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15172374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15172374</a><br>you&#039;d have to be blind to think this isn&#039;t a structural alanogue", "filename": "adhd", "ext": ".png", "w": 365, "h": 387, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675365141613434, "time": 1675365141, "md5": "fwYgfrX7dJJmy1upJtALKw==", "fsize": 11909, "resto": 15171563}, {"no": 15174362, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:12:53", "name": "VIRUSES DON&#039;T EXIST", "com": "<a href=\"#p15171563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15171563</a><br>anons who post personal stories are faggots", "time": 1675415573, "resto": 15171563}, {"no": 15174367, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:15:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15172221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15172221</a><br>It makes them more able to understand the problems of others", "time": 1675415743, "resto": 15171563}, {"no": 15174397, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:57:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174367</a><br>Yes, when they start to hallucinate it becomes easier to understand neurotypical people.", "time": 1675418235, "resto": 15171563}, {"no": 15174415, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174367</a><br><a href=\"#p15174397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174397</a><br>For example, being hated at random may turn into, IDK, &quot;this random thing I did made them hallucinate I want to rape their children&quot;. &quot;Why do they go along with this person&#039;s obvious lies?&quot; turns into &quot;they hallucinated on this person&#039;s eyes that they mean well.&quot;.

By encouraging those close to them to vaccinate, people are both promoting compliance with social norms and increasing their own level of protection against the disease. Also, by judging those who do not vaccinate more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote cooperative behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like indirect reciprocity or partner choice, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prosocial outcomes.

Yes, he had an interest in science and philosophy, since that was typical of Renaissance humanists like Da Vinci, but he wasn&#039;t really at the forefront of these fields. Like I said in my previous post, even within the context of Renaissance Italian mathematics and science he wasn&#039;t at the top. For example, Tartaglia and Cardano were both mathematicians of the time period who have had a much greater impact on the development of math and science. However, the most relevant example is probably Luca Pacioli (pic related). He was a very famous mathematician and scientist, and he actually worked with Da Vinci. They wrote scientific books together. Luca Pacioli handled the science and math and Da Vinci handled the illustrations. That&#039;s because Luca Pacioli was more of a scientist and Da Vinci was more of an artist. <br><br><a href=\"#p15171738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15171738</a><br>Flying machines and tanks are inventions not discoveries, i.e. they fall in the domain of engineering, not science. It&#039;s very common amongst normies and the pop sci community to conflate science and engineering, but they&#039;re different fields with different cultures and different skill sets. Also, Da Vinci didn&#039;t actually invent those things, all he did was create drawings, and they generally didn&#039;t involve a lot of mathematical or mechanical detail. <br><br>As for human anatomy, he may have made some minor contribution, but that doesn&#039;t make him one of the greatest scientists of all time.

Even European countries lack rigorous monitoring, and Africa&#039;s interior temperature is completely reliant on model-created data.<br><br>Your argument is built on so many lies that it&#039;s impossible for you to negotiate the maze and give a single, straightforward answer to any question.", "time": 1675218748, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168444, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br>If you can\u2019t tell the difference between regional sea level that\u2019s influenced by erosion and tectonics and global sea level rise then why are you posting your baseless opinions?", "filename": "09747C1C-F7A7-4156-8221-4E4DB5D2CEE7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 915, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675218795099648, "time": 1675218795, "md5": "mn9uBPzC4MK38T6q/O08AA==", "fsize": 84712, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168450, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:34:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168444</a><br>Climate soientists don&#039;t seem to be able to tell the difference so it&#039;s right to call them out for their nonsense.", "time": 1675218897, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168451, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:35:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know about tides</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know that one random building doesn&#039;t reflect the world</span>", "time": 1675218916, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168452, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:35:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168435</a><br>i&#039;m the anon who posted that graph. the satellite data is correct because it only shows a few millimeters (couple centimeters, at most) of increased sea level on average. key word: on average.", "time": 1675218952, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168458, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168444</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are two sea levels!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newton was wrong, gravity is woke and binary now!</span>", "filename": "hahaha", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675219220611933, "time": 1675219220, "md5": "ypxAGRlvvaBQI4O/Tm99LA==", "fsize": 14133, "resto": 15167861}, {"no": 15168459, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:40:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15168450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168450</a><br>I wonder why sea level rise is documented with global sea level altimetry instead of with pictures <br><a href=\"#p15168440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15168440</a><br>Again complete ignorance or willful lying.

However, if you look into the history of the Septuigant, you&#039;ll find out that by the time of Origen there were many copies with a variety of errors and even different versions with their own passages. Origen of Alexandria had to reconcile these and referred to the Hebrew at his time (Isaiah in the Masoretic texts are nearly identical to the Dead Sea Scrolls).

The key observation is that if you have a bit that sticks out horizontally, you can get rid of it by extending the bit it&#039;s sticking out of vertically by the same amount, without changing the perimeter. So you divide the shape into two parts like in picrel, then you calculate the perimeter of the part on the left: you take the bits that stick out by 3, 2, 3 units, get rid of them, extend the &quot;column&quot; they&#039;re attached to by (3+2+3)=8 units, leaving you with a vertically flipped L with a height of 16 units and a top edge of 4. That&#039;s a parimeter of (16+4)*2=40. Now you have the part on the right. If you ignore the hole on the bottom and treat it like another L shape, you get a parimeter of (4+7)*2=22. Suppose the height of that hole on the bottom is x; then the calculation is short by 2x. However, treating the two parts as separate and adding their perimeters overshoots the real perimeter by adding the length of that shared bit twice, i.e. it overshoots by 2x, so it cancels out. 40+22=62, or in other words: (8+4+3+2+3+4+7)*2=62.
