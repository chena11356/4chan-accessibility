The majority of fructose sugar always is dealt with by the liver. It&#039;s different than the other carbs in this way. With something like starch, only the excess gets sent to the liver for storage (glycogen). This is why excess fructose is particularly bad for the liver. Also, if you are eating excess calories in the absence of carbs, you will not get diabetes/insulin resistance. You will just gain weight and probably get high serum trigs. In the absence of carbs, the body will not need to produce excess insulin and it will not have to make the tissue resistant to insulin and glucose uptake in order to protect the tissue from hyperglycemia, and you will not get type 2 DM. So it really is the excess carbs ultimately. Though, excess carbs AND fat, and thus excess calories in general, will also do it, providing you don&#039;t have a genetic component that is protective against DM.

Back in the day, when there were not year round super markets with out of season fruit shipped in, and especially in the northern areas, such as europe, you would have only a short window of fruit harvest.

So this is why it naturally supresses satiation hormones and promotes hunger. So if you are eating and drinking fruit sugar all of the time, you will continually be hungry and be prompted to over eat.

The same Bildungsphilister would have scorned Matisse before it penetrated our consciousness). [...] The Bildungsphilister has a pathological vulnerability to cultural constructions. The same applies to the philisto-academic: he just follows topics used by others, ranking them by importance, without a shade of intellectual independence. In fact in academia the great dominant majority of workers are Bildungsphilisters, with a small minority of persons in possession of a brain on their own.

I don&#039;t feel the vertigo anymore, but I suspect my brain just adapted to it, because I still I get carsickness (never had that problem before the shot). I can do muscle training and play Beat Saber.

But something subtler will be done, and this is the most important idea in the book: when you explain a behavior with one of these disciplines, you are implicitly invoking all the disciplines\u2014any given type of explanation is the end product of the influences that preceded it. It has to work this way. If you say, \u201cThe behavior occurred because of the release of neurochemical Y in the brain,\u201d you are also saying, \u201cThe behavior occurred because the heavy secretion of hormone X this morning increased the levels of neurochemical Y.\u201d You\u2019re also saying, \u201cThe behavior occurred because the environment in which that person was raised made her brain more likely to release neurochemical Y in response to certain types of stimuli.\u201d And you\u2019re also saying,\u201cbecause of the gene that codes for the particular version of neurochemical Y.\u201d And if you\u2019ve so much as whispered the word \u201cgene,\u201d you\u2019re also saying,\u201cand because of the millennia of factors that shaped the evolution of that particular gene.\u201d And so on.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are not different disciplinary buckets.

To be specific, this means the natural state for quantum particles is a superposition of all possibilities. Mathematically, we represent an unmeasured particle as a superposition function which shows us the probability of a particle being measured with any given value of any given property. This means we have a graph of x, y, and probability all plotted on their own axis (or you may say, as their own dimension!).<br>I want you to now imagine the probability function as an actual property of the particle, like mass or charge, or x-position. When we measure the particle&#039;s momentum, and &#039;collapse this wave function&#039;, mathematically we are performing a Fourier transform on the probability (or wave) function. This means we are taking information about a function and projecting it into another dimension. In normal math, this would be the frequency dimension, but in quantum mechanics we transform the wave into a new function in &#039;momentum space&#039;! The Copenhagen interpretation says we have fundamentally altered this particle by transforming the wave function.<br><br>Now that a particle was measured, and the wave function collapsed: we can perform experiments with this particle and predict the outcome 100% of the time. We have altered the state of the particle by measuring it; no longer is a superposition.<br><br>An entangled pair means (mathematically) that we can describe both particles with a single wave function; imagine two sine waves, summed. Therefore, by measuring one particle, you have actually measured both and (spooky action:) collapsed both wave functions! You have influenced the entangled counterpart as if the information traveled faster than light - telling the distant particle to now exist with a collapsed wave function.<br>However, information itself is still capped at c.", "time": 1673059615, "resto": 15103947}, {"no": 15105314, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:55:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15104677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15104677</a><br><a href=\"#p15105305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105305</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, information itself is still capped at c.</span><br>I just want to clarify:<br>Here I am saying you now know something about that very distant particle, so what can you do?<br>Well nothing. <br>Sure, you know something about it, but the only way to act on that knowledge is to convey information about the particle to the location that other particle exists at.

It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

Not to mention it&#039;s a Western prize in the first place, with a natural Western bias. <br><br>But sure, let&#039;s go with that. The Nobel prize was first awarded in 1901. Western society was largely homogeneous until the 60s, which is coincidentally when Western science started falling apart, meaning you are padding the present failures of &quot;diversity&quot; with generations-old successes of homogeneity.

The Simoa antigen assays for spike, S1, and nucleocapsid were previously validated in plasma from pre-pandemic healthy subjects, pre-pandemic patients with respiratory infections, COVID-19 negative patients, and COVID-19 positive patients [7]. Authors detected S1 and N in 64% of COVID-19 positive patients, and S1 levels were significantly associated with disease severity. Here antigens S1 and spike were measured to probe mRNA translation, whereas nucleocapsid antigen served as a negative control (Figures 1A, B, C, Supplementary Table 5). After the first 100-\u00b5g dose, the mRNA-1273 vaccine produced detectable levels of S1 antigen in plasma in 11 participants, and spike antigen was detected in 3 of 13 participants.

In natural conception, only the strongest sperm can make it to the egg. With the standard IVF procedure, they just pick a sperm and an egg that look reasonably healthy, and inject the sperm into the egg. Since you don&#039;t have the same degree of sperm competition, the sperm is more likely to have high mutational load. If you were to squirt donor semen into the woman&#039;s vagina and conceive the kid that way, or create a new IVF procedure that more closely resembles natural conception, it would theoretically be less dysgenic.

It can very easily be that male/female categories get confused or that male/female imitation is skewed due to the nature of their exposures during development.<br><a href=\"#p15105317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105317</a><br>The cross-species principle that plays out scientifically is that personality variation across individuals helps the success of social species.<br>It&#039;s all speculation whether a specific trait is actually important for specific reasons.", "time": 1673062993, "resto": 15105196}, {"no": 15106237, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)09:33:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15105196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105196</a><br>why do women? do they have different ass?", "time": 1673101999, "resto": 15105196}, {"no": 15106362, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)10:35:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15105196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105196</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BD<wbr>Mhn5JMBQ", "time": 1673105757, "resto": 15105196}, {"no": 15106630, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:20:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15105299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105299</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People\u2019s sexualities can shift due to major psychological events.</span><br>Yeah... like getting molested by an adult homosexual.", "filename": "1667111742586310", "ext": ".png", "w": 832, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1673112056016205, "time": 1673112056, "md5": "mQuRxPauSr5LRbYImXSvJQ==", "fsize": 536522, "resto": 15105196}, {"no": 15106656, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:30:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15105196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105196</a><br>Homosexuality has been recorded across every world culture across every time period.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

For example, the rhinovirus doesn&#039;t do well at warmer temperatures, so it tends to stay in the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 is better at infecting the lungs, but even then, I provided a study where only 64% of the infected had detectable viral particles in their blood, and this was using severe patients (mild cases appear to have a much lower rate, but that&#039;s from another study). The vaccinated, however, had detectable S1 sub unit in 84% of people.

A paperclip AI is far preferable to these nightmare scenarios, because nobody has to be around to witness it. All a paperclip AI does is kill people who were going to die within a century anyway.

However, if suffering subroutines are actually useful for optimization in general, any kind of AI likely to be created will use them, including human-aligned FAI. Most people don&#039;t even care about animals, let alone some process. In this case, s-risks are truly unavoidable except by preventing AGI from ever being created, probably by human extinction by some other means.<br><br>Furthermore, I don&#039;t think suffering is likely to be instrumentally convergent, since I would think if you had full control over all optimization processes in the world, it would be most useful to eliminate all processes which would suffer for, and therefore dislike and try to work against, your optimal vision for the world.", "time": 1673226797, "resto": 15109892}, {"no": 15109904, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)20:14:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My honest, unironic conclusion after considering these things is that Clippy is the least horrible plausible future.

A basic education to a level expected for everyone, and higher level of education that is typically specialized and limited to those who would benefit from it. The question is where does this transition occur. At one point, we would have considered highschool the beginning of higher education, but it has been made nearly compulsory and the quality of education varies widely. At this point to many college is viewed as a continuation of highschool and there is a pervasive societal narrative that college is necessary. <br><br>In conclusion it is not bad that as we move forward, we expect more people to obtain higher levels of education, but the standards of that education need to be maintained or it becomes meaningless.

He covers superficial everything you need to know to start with QM, you wont understand much about QM with that book. Why? Because he goes the Schroedinger Wavemechanics approach but doesn&#039;t go deep into it. Speaking of which, there are several different approaches of Quamntum mechanics, or lets say, formalism you could follow. The most known is the Wavemechanics by Schroedinger, the second is the Heisenbergian Matrixmechanics, the third is less of a formalism but involves Functional Analysis and therefore a bit of Matrix mechanics and its more of Mathematical Physics. One significant approach are Path Integrals by Feynman, also you shouldn&#039;t avoid Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, but i guess thats something that comes last. As for QM Books, have a quick List: &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Dirac. &quot;Matrix mechanics&quot; by H.S. Green (He was a student of Max Born), &quot;Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral Point of View&quot; by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe. &quot;Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals&quot; by Richard Feynman. Also Lev Landaus &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; out of his &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; though, there is a newer one which fused with the Quantumelectrodynamic book so beware, keep your eyes open for the older one. Also if you are in the mood i totally recommend the Feynman lectures which also include a book on QM. All of those books are very basic and teach you the various different approaches and formalisms. What i can&#039;t recommend, but will include is W. Paulis &quot;Wellenmechanik&quot; and Schroedingers &quot;Abhandlungen zur Wellenmechanik&quot;, &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Von Neumann. There are probably a few more, don&#039;t know, i am not at home, and those i don&#039;t recommend are gems but only useful if you know german and if you get your hands on them, but they are all rather Mathematical PHysics books so they&#039;ll teach the math behind.

Other animals use it to establish and maintain pecking orders and breeding rights. Since humans are mostly free from natural selection, we&#039;re mostly affected by sexual and artificial selection. The being the case, it&#039;s reasonable that a mechanism of behavior so widely observed in nature, is still practiced despite our increased intelligence, and our ability to contemplate morality.<br><br>In order to better understand this behavior, I think it&#039;s best to start by establishing that geography has a significant impact on culture. I.e, a group of people settle in an area, determine what the most comfortable existence they can establish is, and then create a culture that justifies that existence, while demonizing detracting behaviors, and encouraging behavior that supports the aforementioned culture. <br><br>How does bullying factor into all this? While no one likes the idea of being bullied, harassed, etc, we all enjoy upward social mobility, or at the very least, stability in regards to our current social position. By degrading others, especially in social settings such as school, a bully is able to publically announce their social standing, as at the very least, being above that of the person they are harassing. Most people never do anything to prevent the bullying of another, because that action introduces the opportunity for downward social mobility, with little in the way of possible rewards. Although we all like to believe we would do something heroic when we see wrongdoing, most psychological and sociological evidence points to the contrary.", "time": 1672994375, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103398, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br>It is also unsurprising that most bullies tend to not be extremely successful, and the most victims suffer longterm negative consequences. The type of person attracted to bullying will typically be a person that cannot establish a high social standing with physical ability or intelligence, so by demeaning others, especially those with traits they lack, they are able to create a level of social standing (albeit temporarily) usually unobtainable to them. Regarding the victims of bullying, this attitude of &quot;it toughens you up&quot;, is just ridiculous. While we can always expect negative social interactions to be a part of our experience as a social species, being harassed and abused is not to be expected, as it is maladaptive behavior. <br><br>I think it&#039;s also important to make a distinction between bullying that exists to elevate the social standing of the abuser, and the natural &quot;demonization&quot; of behavior that is seen as culturally inappropriate. As I mentioned before, all cultures seek to encourage some behavior and prevent others, and to the end, social settings have an unspoken code of conduct which is to be followed, or one will face social consequences. And these consequences tend to be focused on ostracization, instead of intentional physical or psychological abuse. As an example, if you were at store, and a person walked in dressed as an actual clown, most people would be uncomfortable around them, and treat them differently as a result, since they&#039;re violating social norms. This type of bullying is useful for society, as it promotes social cohesion, a sense of normalcy, and shared values, whereas the aforementioned type of bullying, has not postive consequences", "time": 1672995147, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103504, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)05:15:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br><a href=\"#p15103398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103398</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t subscribe to your theory if you were GROWING ON MY ASS", "filename": "kevin&#039;s brother", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 306, "h": 393, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673000100981416, "time": 1673000100, "md5": "yCDf5xi4xAJ2xnKwZkXwUg==", "fsize": 25954, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103610, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)07:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15100888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15100888</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think about this study</span><br>Psychology isn&#039;t science", "time": 1673006593, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15105050, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)19:28:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101464</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s a bit extreme, don&#039;t you think?</span><br>I thought it was letting the dude off easy.

There&#039;s no technological hurdle to it, no resource hurdle, no logistical hurdle, the only thing stopping me from doing so is that some suit on a city zoning board made a regulation that I have to apply for a permit to do so, and if I circumvent that hurdle for the sake of doing what I want, said suit will send men with suits and/or guns to my property to obstruct my efforts. My only way of avoiding said obstruction is if my property is outside of said-bureaucrat&#039;s jurisdiction. Or suppose I was a puritan in late 17th century England and wanted to practice my religious beliefs. There&#039;d be nothing spiritual preventing me from doing so, there&#039;d be no hurdle posed by resources, but there would be political hurdles preventing me from doing so, and my only recourse would be leaving England and going somewhere England&#039;s laws against my practices could no longer obstruct my efforts.<br><br>Colonization not only provides access to territory and resources, but also provides a degree of separation and independence from whatever conditions or obstacles lead to the dissatisfaction that motivated colonization in the first place.

super size me and was in 9th grade in geography class where it showed the class in a class that humans in america have a huge footprint globally on earth. i just felt like i was a horrible person or taking a babies life in Taiwan(?) every time i would eat a campbells chicken noodle soup... kind of a question but there is no question flair", "filename": "idk", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 3000,

Very good.<br><br>Theaet.

Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your own answer about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them all in one class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one definition.<br><br>Theaet.

It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers.
