Proof: Notice that b | a. Otherwise, we would have that p = ac for some integer c, which is impossible since p is prime. Then b/a is an integer. Let d = b/a. Then a = pd. Since p and d are integers, we have that a | p.<br><br>Case 1: n | 2. Let n = 2k. Then 4k^2/m^2 = 2. Thus, k^2/m^2 = 1/2, which means m^2 = 2k^2. By our corollary, m | 2.

As a 5-year-old he memorized all the countries in the world, with capitals, populations, area and flags. He did the same for the 400+ municipalities in Norway. All on his own.

While many Eastern European players follow the standard Soviet chess school of studying hard and methodical and not playing too many tournaments, Magnus does the complete opposite. He only does things with chess that he enjoys and never forces himself to do boring work. If he wants to take some time off, he does.

The imbecile doesn&#039;t even understand evolutionary theory, and fitness in particular. Fitness is the grand tautology in evolutionary theory. The organisms that are more fit are those organisms that pass on their genes. That&#039;s it. Idiots often load the term with additional meaning, like &quot;healthier, stronger, faster, being able to outcompete&quot; but the simple mathematical reality is that &quot;fitness&quot; is merely a population-level calculus of what survives into the next generation. There is no intrinsic fitness of an organism. Not its previous evolutionary history, not its physical abilities, not its available resources. None of that. Those are mere influencers of the LIKELYHOOD of fitness, i.e. the likelihood of passing on your genes to your descendants. But fitness is fitness. If you had a population of rabbits and randomly killed half of them before they got to reproduce, the half that survives are BY DEFINITION more fit than the ones that died. it really is that simple. So when this imbecile constructs a model in which &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;reality perception&quot; are antagonistic, it is a matter of mathematical tautology that &quot;reality perception&quot; would go extinct, since in his VERY MODEL IT IS NOT FIT.<br><br>Moron.

Humans evolved breasts as sexually attractive features precisely because they signalled infertility. A male primate who is not put off by, or even attracted to, breasts will stay with a female protecting her when she is in her most vulnerable state - during pregnancy and just after childbirth. For a female to select for such males improves her chances of successful reproduction. Moreover, in an environment where it is an advantage for males to stay with and support a female, a taste for breasts can keep the male investing in his own interest at the most critical time for support. In essence, permanent breasts had a pre-historic purpose of separating the men from the \u2018fuckboys\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My theory of the evolution of breasts is that they are an adaptation for a slow life history rather than a fast life history. Breasts are K-selected. r-selected animals with a fast life history have short lifespans and mature quickly. K-selected species have longer lifespans, invest more in their children and take longer to mature. Fast life history is an adaptation to unstable ecologies where mortality is more random and uncontrollable so the best option is to have as many offspring as possible. By contrast in predictable environments, there\u2019s an advantage to investing more in offspring to increase their chances.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Breasts by selecting for stable, long-term relationships between males and females facilitate long-term investment in offspring. It makes sense that only humans would have permanent breasts. Compared to other primates we have a slow life history strategy. We live for a particularly long time, take a long time to mature and need substantial resources and protection to develop our large brains.</span>", "time": 1672855373, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15099969, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlT<wbr>rGIW5iZ8", "filename": "dutton jolly heretic", "ext": ".png", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672855434181463, "time": 1672855434, "md5": "BfUid5W9LC1c6FBxF6EBPg==", "fsize": 41191, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15099975, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)13:06:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "booba", "filename": "couple_s_caress_by_jora_bora_dewp7yv-fullview", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1329, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672855601891133, "time": 1672855601, "md5": "KUlwc5GDfXKzfK32AykUjg==", "fsize": 149202, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15100692, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:23:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15099661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15099661</a><br>I would like to conduct further research into this area", "filename": "hakase", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1068, "h": 1425, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672874627270860, "time": 1672874627, "md5": "xHuo8fUnAgnhlmeO5M0QBw==", "fsize": 133963, "resto": 15099661}, {"no": 15100698, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)18:27:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15099661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15099661</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why do permanently enlarged breasts exist</span><br>Women are supposed to breastfeed their whole lives.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

McKinsey itself has as revenue the GDP of a small country so if they get involved they can move more money around than the politicians can even imagine. However even in rich nations consultants seem to be generally detrimental. There was that famous story of how McKinsey charged the french government $500,000 just to give a presentation, and then due to scheduling issues said presentation never happened. It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

They don&#039;t care that GMO farming destroys the land because it&#039;s heckin Science\u2122 (even though it&#039;s all about monopolization of the food supply and making food resilient to toxic pesticides and herbicides which you then eat). Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

The spin offset would be lesser depending upon how far from the edge the injection point. At the exact center of the wire, no electricity at all would be injected. In fact, it is critical that no electricity be carried by the central strand of what is in actuality a bundle of thin wires. The centralmost strand would ideally be coated with an electrical (but not magnetic) insulator. This turns out to be critical for maximizing the longevity of the helical configuration, which otherwise would become disorganized before long.<br><br>The reason that the central strand needs to remain electrically null is that if pure direct current with absolutely no spin offset were to be carried even accidentally by the line, the traditional Hall Effect would overcome the artificial inward-facing Hall Effect created by the helicity of the electricity as injected. Since all of the electricity is constantly tending to fall toward the center, if it were allowed to reach that point, its momentum would ultimately carry it out of the other side of the wire.

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.<br><br>Comments: 306 Pages.", "filename": "TIMESAND___particles==", "ext": ".png", "w": 996, "h": 339, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 42, "tim": 1672694738169450, "time": 1672694738, "md5": "cX7qa+60VLIhRJcy5tNs7Q==", "fsize": 33414, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095592, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:11", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095591</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694771055141, "time": 1672694771, "md5": "cz56Nz83qwgR/PURAssFGQ==", "fsize": 3532348, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095593, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:50", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095592</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_B.jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694810241441, "time": 1672694810, "md5": "lZ4x9Pg2IMP2l7FqKLdHQA==", "fsize": 3284973, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095595, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:29:05", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095593</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694945726281, "time": 1672694945, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095779, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:22:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where SUSY particles?", "time": 1672701741, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095860, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095779</a><br>What&#039;s SASSY particles?", "time": 1672705323, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095867, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095860</a><br>female particles. they produce many daughter particles.", "time": 1672705531, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15096327, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)00:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095557</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t really know</span><br>Yes I do.
