I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw [Embed]<br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool.<br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673944551742642, "time": 1673944551, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130891, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130886</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeoroids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power.<br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him. Compared to a fixed station where an accidentally untethered astronaut could get back with just a few m/s delta v in a small package like the MMU/SAFER.", "time": 1673944712, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130916, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hello please checking out Dream Chaser DC-200 series on Vulcan Centaur that I drew :)", "filename": "VC DC-200 final no watermark", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2400, "h": 3600, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673945661383245, "time": 1673945661, "md5": "M9Bx/nLbLyNqzpZOWB6klg==", "fsize": 1414013, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130917, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:54:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130778</a><br>Probably going to be dismissed after bungling the 5G transition again kek", "time": 1673945696, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130943, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;wake up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;check /sfg/ after weeks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starship STILL hasn&#039;t launched</span>", "time": 1673947191, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130952, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:30:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130943</a><br>Soon\u2122.

So here is what I&#039;ll do: define multiplication, and then, using induction, prove the properties you mentioned. The key idea is that when we say m * n, we mean &quot;the sum of n parcels equal to m&quot;. More precisely, for every natural number m, let [math]f_m: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}[/math] be defined as [math]f_m(p) = p + m[/math] so that [math]m \\cdot (n + 1) = (f_m)^n(m)[/math], where (f_m)^n is f_m iterated with itself n times. You might argue that this is just as arbitrary as the properties I am trying to prove, but I would disagree: the definition of m * (n + 1) is just the translation of &quot;the sum of n+1 parcels equal to m&quot; to the mathematical language. <br><br>Now with the definition of multiplication in mind, we see that [math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[\\math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]. This is really the heart of the first property. Now, the proof is as follows: let X be the set of natural numbers p such that (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p for every natural number m, n. I already have proved that 1 is in X above. Then, suppose p is in X, we will prove that (p+1) is also in X:<br><br>[math]\\begin{align}(m + n)\\cdot(p + 1)&amp;= (m+n)\\cdot p + (m +n) \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + n \\cdot p + m + n \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + m + n \\cdot p + n \\\\&amp;=m\\cdot(p+1)+n\\cdot(p+1) \\end{align}[/math]<br><br>There, I used the hypothesis that p is in X and the addition properties. We can conclude, by induction, that X = N. So we have just proved the first property. Oh fuck, I am not proving the second one, fuck it, but it just as easy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 80 iq retard</span>", "time": 1673916393, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130153, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130148</a><br>[math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[/math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]", "time": 1673916529, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130157, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are any of you guys like, professional mathematicians or have made a career out of math?<br>I kinda went NEET mode for 3 years...

The &quot;key&quot; here likely lies in all the endogenous retroviruses (and other assorted transposable elements) in the genome of the mice (which also applies to humans). Can &quot;blame evolution&quot; for that, these parasitic genetic elements have acted like an accelerator for adaption due to two core features: being highly mobile within the genome once activated (and if still intact enough to reintegrate) and usually carrying strong gene promoters (usually controlled by cellular stress). Problem being, these sequences are still in most cases &quot;parasitic junk&quot; and get epigenetically silenced by default. Now some of them however carry a feature which in the case of a DNA double strand break (so DNA stress roughly speaking) prevents the silencing of their sequence after the chromatin has been &quot;opened&quot; for repair (this btw does play an active role in the terminal differentiation of some cell types) ... keeping them perpetually active and potentially disrupting, triggering further &quot;control mechanisms&quot; within the cell like senescence or apoptosis which contribute to aging.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

Huge problem that Indian politicians and academics talk about all the time. Indians are the single most successful group of people after Jews in the US, and it&#039;s not because they are allowed to flourish anymore here than back there, but more so because they come here only if they were already flourishing back there. Unlike Mexicans, the process of immigration is tough and back-breaking for most of the world, European, Asians and Africans included (yes even Africans, Nigerians are the most educated and one of the most successful groups here). Hence, only the already rich and/or highly educated ones end up here, and they tend to be quite smart on average compared to the rest of the populace. In the end, it&#039;s the illegals that are stupid, hencewhy African immigrants to Europe are way stupider than African immigrants (not African Americans) in the US, and why Hispanics tend to be low IQ since they are illegals as well. Most non-hispanic immigrant groups do significantly better than whites in the US. As for Indians, only the creme of the crop comes here. They have almost one and a half billion people, so it just happens that there population of the &#039;creme of the crop&#039; is much larger than most other groups. Of course superior western Institutions help with nurturing the talent that we select out and allow to immigrate, as they would have likely been not realized back home in pooland. In the end, any Indian that can, leaves India, and it tends to be higher IQ people who do that, at least to the US.

If a process was ever invented to reverse the myelination process it would be able to allow you to continue learning but it would come at the cost of wiping your previous memories, your personality.

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech.

Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money).

His job is confirming behaviour/ontological state before making the determination which medication will be best for you, based on your state, relative to the probable brain chemistry. That&#039;s how pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs: They have to do years of testing to prove they are &#039;effective&#039; more often than not, and they verify that through brain chemistry changes relative to changed behaviour. <br><br>In any case: A certain brain chemistry or state does not always align with the perceived, typical behaviour of that brain chemistry. Take for example testosterone and being aggresive: My cousin beat the shit out of his girlfriend and was arrested for domestic abuse. He had medical imaging of his brain done as well as genetic sampling. They found he had very low testosterone levels relative to the typical man his age. I think he even had a a slightly higher estrogen than men his age as well. So he actually didn&#039;t need any medication but rather strict, psychological counceling, since it was not a matter of brain chemistry or embalance, but something personal. What he ACTUALLY needed was spiritual council, but that&#039;s a different matter. <br><br>Some more elite psychiatric clinics have MRI&#039;s on site to take brain scans and those psychiatrists can usually read those scans and talk to you about them, but these are the top of the top psychiatrists and it costs and arm and a leg to see them.

We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw <br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool. <br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673942251870097, "time": 1673942251, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "please keep the /sfg/ content in the /sfg/ thread", "time": 1673943506, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130884, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130848</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeorids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power. <br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him. Compared to a fixed station where an accidentally untethered astronaut could get back with just a few m/s delta v in a small package like the MMU/SAFER.", "time": 1673944479, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130896, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130868</a><br><a href=\"#p15130884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130884</a><br><br>ok I reposted to SFG", "time": 1673944828, "resto": 15130438}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15125878, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)04:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/sci/ humour thread", "filename": "spin", "ext": ".png", "w": 373, "h": 50, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 33, "tim": 1673776768106507, "time": 1673776768, "md5": "Fqe8ucfAMBTlw3mH+neihg==", "fsize": 9854, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sci-humour-thread", "replies": 25, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 15125904, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:14:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125878</a><br>the universe is both autistic and artistic as it has a tendency to be both aesthetically pleasing and symmetrical in more ways than one (or two or three or four or ...wait, what comes after the digit the mathematics scale is usually based off to most species that think mostly in terms of objective reality, and count on the same digits they use tools with? oh yeah, 4 and 1. enjoy starting to actually think about mathematics as something helpful, and realize that a base four system could be beneficial in some ways.", "time": 1673777646, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15125924, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:29:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "now metaphorically spin your browser to another thread cos the explanation of that post won&#039;t be posted to this one", "time": 1673778583, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15125940, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:40:20", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1661977461411003", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 411, "h": 543, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673779220250293, "time": 1673779220, "md5": "irlWmBEuGlTxUlrzgtImhg==", "fsize": 41214, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126205, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)08:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125940</a><br>There&#039;s an anime version.", "time": 1673790547, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126591, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:09:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125940</a><br>lost", "time": 1673806153, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126600, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:13:08", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "hartshorne", "ext": ".png", "w": 856, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673806388291932, "time": 1673806388, "md5": "AbkmjaipbuMTxjOROlfsnw==", "fsize": 403833, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126861, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)14:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126600</a>", "filename": "truth", "ext": ".png", "w": 527, "h": 799, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673812292395649, "time": 1673812292, "md5": "M73iRLtl2y1wFKHduQESgA==", "fsize": 357965, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126914, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)15:16:11", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1642379680136", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 952, "h": 734, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1673813771107710, "time": 1673813771, "md5": "+UVOv5eZOmz3d6eObuTP7g==", "fsize": 86093, "resto": 15125878}, {"no": 15126928, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)15:22:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,<br>I&#039;m a pureblood man: no time to talk.<br>Music loud and women hot,<br>I ain&#039;t never gonna get the shot.<br><br>And now it&#039;s all right.

First and foremost, it lacks a sheaf theory, i.e., his method of patching together affine varieties to form abstract varieties is clumsy.

The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate. Abnormal ECGs were obtained in 51 (1.0%) of the students, of which 1 was diagnosed with mild myocarditis and another 4 were judged to have significant arrhythmia. None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously. Using these five students as a positive outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were 100% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac symptoms are common after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but the incidences of significant arrhythmias and myocarditis are only 0.1%. The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect but cost effect needs further discussed. What is Known: \u2022 The incidence of cardiac adverse effects was reported to be as high as 1.5 per 10 000 persons after the second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in the young male population based on the reporting system. What is New: \u2022 Through this mass ECG screening study after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine we found: (1) The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate; (2) the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%; (3) The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect.</span><br><br>I wonder why OP left this out?", "time": 1673756801, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125365, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>what&#039;s your point?", "time": 1673757512, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125389, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>meds.", "time": 1673758286, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125427, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but they&#039;ll be a lot less trusting.</span><br>that&#039;s a sign of intelligence. <br><br>Never trust authority figures.", "filename": "Joker World", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673759020239688, "time": 1673759020, "md5": "9U6pwGb5wPbnN+thWf9Fqg==", "fsize": 39430, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125432, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:05:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125197</a><br>kek!", "filename": "Vax Song", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1060, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673759122894624, "time": 1673759122, "md5": "bEbpEAOlMIE/YaOqG4V3Zw==", "fsize": 217959, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125365</a><br><a href=\"#p15125389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125389</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;17</span>% have cardiac symptoms guys!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously.</span><br>Cope.", "time": 1673761619, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125473, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically love the whole viruses aren&#039;t real gimmick and have been posting it a bunch everywhere.

During WWII, conscientious objectors could fulfil their obligations to the nation without fighting in the war through alternative service. One of those alternative services was to participate in scientific studies like the Minnesota Starvation Study. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A faction of the Civilian Public Service camps developed into a scientific research unit known as Camp #115, or the \u201cGuinea pig units.\u201d These units included around 500 conscientious objectors who volunteered to be scientific test subjects in a wide range of human medical experiments in the country\u2019s top universities and hospitals.[40] The majority of these experiments were conducted under the direction and approval of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Committee on Medical Research (CMR), and the Surgeon General at leading academic and medical institutions such as Harvard Medical School, Yale and Stanford Universities, and Massachusetts General Hospital. These experiments involved a range of research topics, including studying disease, survival in extreme conditions, and equipment testing. The experiments often endangered the health of the COs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minnesota Starvation Study was divided into four phases: A twelve-week baseline control phase; a 24-week starvation phase, causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of his pre-starvation body weight; and 2 recovery phases, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried.

The math and boundary conditions set by Maxwell&#039;s Eq in linear media imply that the angular frequency, w, and the &quot;opposite&quot; component (or the xy component, or parallel to the boundary) of the wavenumber, k, are unchanged. The angular frequency part obviously means that the energy is conserved. This would not be true if it were non-linear media.

You could say that it comes from the fields; you can say it comes from the charged particles it goes through.

From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

But Plato also believed that this is not the whole story. Behind this unreliable world of appearances is a world of permanence and reliability. Plato calls this more real (because permanent) world, the world of \u2018Forms\u2019 or \u2018Ideas\u2019 (eidos/idea in Greek). But what is a Platonic Form or Idea?<br><br>Take for example a perfect triangle, as it might be described by a mathematician. This would be a description of the Form or Idea of (a) Triangle. Plato says such Forms exist in an abstract state but independent of minds in their own realm. Considering this Idea of a perfect triangle, we might also be tempted to take pencil and paper and draw it. Our attempts will of course fall short. Plato would say that peoples\u2019 attempts to recreate the Form will end up being a pale facsimile of the perfect Idea, just as everything in this world is an imperfect representation of its perfect Form. The Idea or Form of a triangle and the drawing we come up with is a way of comparing the perfect and imperfect. How good our drawing is will depend on our ability to recognise the Form of Triangle. Although no one has ever seen a perfect triangle, for Plato this is not a problem. If we can conceive the Idea or Form of a perfect triangle in our mind, then the Idea of Triangle must exist.<br><br>The Forms are not limited to geometry. According to Plato, for any conceivable thing or property there is a corresponding Form, a perfect example of that thing or property. The list is almost inexhaustible. Tree, House, Mountain, Man, Woman, Ship, Cloud, Horse, Dog, Table and Chair, would all be examples of putatively independently-existing abstract perfect Ideas.", "time": 1673894304, "resto": 15128390}, {"no": 15129353, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129014</a><br>Plato says that true and reliable knowledge rests only with those who can comprehend the true reality behind the world of everyday experience. In order to perceive the world of the Forms, individuals must undergo a difficult education. This is also true of Plato\u2019s philosopher-kings, who are required to perceive the Form of Good(ness) in order to be well-informed rulers. We must be taught to recall this knowledge of the Forms, since it is already present in a person\u2019s mind, due to their soul apparently having been in the world of the Forms before they were born. Someone wanting to do architecture, for example, would be required to recall knowledge of the Forms of Building, House, Brick, Tension, etc. The fact that this person may have absolutely no idea about building design is irrelevant. On this basis, if you can\u2019t recall the necessary knowledge then you\u2019re obviously not suited to be an architect, or a king. Not everyone is suited to be king in the same way as not everyone is suited to mathematics. Conversely, a very high standard in a particular trade suggests knowledge of its Forms. The majority of people cannot be educated about the nature of the Forms because the Forms cannot be discovered through education, only recalled.<br><br>To explain our relationship to the world of the Forms, in the Republic Plato uses the analogy of people who spend their whole lives living in a cave [see Allegory of the Cave]. All they ever see are shadows on the walls created by their campfire. Compared with the reality of the world of the Forms, real physical objects and events are analogous to being only shadows. Plato also takes the opportunity to use the cave analogy as a political statement. Only the people who have the ability to step out into the sunlight and see (recall) the true reality (the Forms) should rule.", "time": 1673894365, "resto": 15128390}, {"no": 15129364, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:45:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129350</a><br><a href=\"#p15129353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129353</a><br>Based Plato.

Sentience simply is.

And so you can do many interesting things which mimic some of the content and procedures that real consciousnesses do such as the AI tech, but you can not create a freewill awareness unit in that way. This is like asking if sentience can arise in the video game avatar guy you are controlling. The sentience is non-local to the virtual space.
