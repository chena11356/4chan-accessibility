The direction that the involved water and ice molecules are moving causes an accumulation of negative charge in middle and lower region of the cloud, and positive charge in higher region of the cloud (the anvil).<br><br>2) The negatively charged lower region of the cloud induces a positive charge on the surface of the Earth directly below it, creating an electric field between those regions.<br><br>3) At some point the difference in electric charge becomes too great and the air fails as an insulator.

I dropped out of college due to personal issues when I was younger. I was enrolled in an undergrad computer science program.

The \u201cPP\u201d sequence, which is found in both Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer BNT162b2, which were used to stabilize the pre-fusion state of the Spike and were introduced very early during the design phase of these vectorized vaccines https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals<wbr>/vaccines/tiny-tweak-behind-COVID-1<wbr>9/98/i38 , was absent within these Spike sequences, where the native \u201cKV\u201d amino acids were retained.

The nonautonomous Alu elements, short, interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs), variable-number-of-tandem-repeats (VNTR), as well as cellular mRNA-processed pseudogenes, are retrotransposed by the LINE-1 retrotransposition proteins working in trans [43,44]. A recent study showed that endogenous LINE-1 mediates reverse transcription and integration of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the genomes of infected human cells [25]. Furthermore, expression of endogenous LINE-1 is often increased upon viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2 infection [45,46,47]. Previous studies showed that LINE-1 retrotransposition activity is regulated by RNA metabolism [48,49], DNA damage response [50], and autophagy [51]. Efficient retrotransposition of LINE-1 is often associated with cell cycle and nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis [52,53], as well as exogenous retroviruses [54,55], which promotes entrance of LINE-1 into the nucleus. In our study, we observed increased LINE-1 ORF1p distribution as determined by immunohistochemistry in the nucleus by BNT162b2 at all concentrations tested (0.5, 1, and 2 \u03bcg/mL), while elevated LINE-1 gene expression was detected at the highest BNT162b2 concentration (2 \u03bcg/mL).</span>", "time": 1676201905, "resto": 15194058}, {"no": 15196538, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)06:40:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196532</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Our results showed that BNT162b2 mRNA readily enters Huh7 cells at a concentration (0.5 \u00b5g/mL) corresponding to 0.5% of the local injection site concentration, induce changes in LINE-1 gene and protein expression, and within 6 h, reverse transcription of BNT162b2 can be detected.

Most people think that Earth-like life is all about a suitable star, habitable zone, and a planet with the right mix of elements. It&#039;s so much more than that. The planet&#039;s core must be suitable to generate a field that protects the planet from solar wind etc. Greenhouse effect must be optimal to support life, but not too much to stifle it. And then, we humans would not be there if an optimally sized meteorite hadn&#039;t destroyed the previous, more primitive dominant creature of the planet. Not to mention that we have populated just the right places (tectonic activity) where our ancestors were forced down from the trees and thus, evolution happened to guide us toward a bigger brain future.

Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as &quot;algebraic objects&quot;. It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject.

Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called formal theories. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.</span>", "time": 1676129136, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194224, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Guess how I know you&#039;re one of the illiterates who post frogs and sperg out about philosophy in every thread?", "time": 1676129302, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194227, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194221</a><br>A formal system is just a specific class of languages.", "time": 1676129397, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194229, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Pic related also explains at the very begging of the paper the sort of systems which it applies to", "filename": "On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathematica And Related Systems (Dover 1992)(Isbn 0486669807)(600Dpi)(T)(79S) Maml(1) - Kurt_Go\u0308del_On_Formally_Undecidabl[...]", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 1502, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129451092621, "time": 1676129451, "md5": "IXycNUT6PICtatAxz7PGRA==", "fsize": 402782, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194234, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194227</a><br>Mathematics is just a &quot;specific class of languages&quot;, then.

No &quot;element of reality&quot; should be missing from the mathematical formalism of physics, i.e. relativistic quantum field theory or its more speculative extension, M-theory. On pain of magic, every gross property of the natural world must be theoretically reducible to fundamental physics. The Standard Model in physics is experimentally well tested. Within its conceptual framework, consciousness would seem not only causally impotent but physically impossible. Hence the &quot;explanatory gap&quot; and the Hard Problem of consciousness.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In recent years, a minority of researchers have proposed that the Hard Problem is an artifact of materialist metaphysics. Contra Kant, but following Schopenhauer, Bertrand Russell, Grover Maxwell, Michael Lockwood, Galen Strawson, et al., the new idealists conjecture that the phenomenology of one&#039;s mind reveals the intrinsic nature of the physical \u2013 the elusive &quot;fire&quot; in the equations about which physics is silent. Mathematical physics yields an exhaustive description of the relational-structural properties of the world. This description may ultimately be encoded by the universal wavefunction of post-Everetta quantum mechanics: our best mathematical description of reality. However, our presupposition that the intrinsic character of the physical lacks phenomenal properties is an additional metaphysical assumption. The assumption is hugely plausible, but it&#039;s not a scientific discovery. Perhaps most tellingly, the only part of the &quot;fire&quot; in the equations to which one ever enjoys direct access, i.e. one&#039;s own consciousness, discloses phenomenal properties that are inconsistent with a materialist ontology. For reasons unexplained, the natural world contains first-person facts. The world supports at least one non-zombie.

Since metaphysical speculation was shut down by Kant&#039;s first Critique, there were no attempts to raise &quot;ideas&quot; into the status of ultimately real stuff the way the Platonists did.

Experiencing is separate from judging, just as judging is separate from reasoning. Although we may claim that conscious experience is undeniably real, we cannot assert that experience itself is truly representative of everything independently of experience.

IQ testing is a very good way of getting a picture of intellectual capacities.<br>Secondly, while it is true that some African populations do have measurable high IQ, almost all have significantly lower IQ than average. What&#039;s more is that those high IQ African groups are also showing clear evidence of their intelligence being inherited, which really just reinforces the argument for Africa being a product of genetics. <br>The fact still remains that there just isn&#039;t any historical evidence for them reaching the same level of achievement as other groups, and when you look at who the high achievers are in modern societies, coincidence have it that those people overwhelmingly come from people who have produced highly developed societies in the past.

This thread highlights the interesting fact that the first Falcon 9s were built even before the Falcon 1 successfully reached orbit, which is a testament to the ambition and innovation of SpaceX.", "filename": "Screen Shot 2023-02-11 at 10.41.07 PM", "ext": ".png", "w": 1444, "h": 944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1676173292652825, "time": 1676173292, "md5": "byj59ymyCLyreU1DChzZhA==", "fsize": 158619, "resto": 15194895}, {"no": 15195830, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/sci/thread/15191720#p15194873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194873</a><br>the collectivist reeeeeeeing from the Banks&#039; Culture fans would drown out a full power static fire", "time": 1676173689, "resto": 15194895}, {"no": 15195835, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:54:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195820</a><br>I still don&#039;t get what anon meant by that linear fission rocket", "time": 1676174073, "resto": 15194895}, {"no": 15195842, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:00:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195164</a>", "filename": "screenshot-70", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1270, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 77, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676174444310801, "time": 1676174444, "md5": "ptms30fB2YOcg0BVP4vCJA==", "fsize": 1268125, "resto": 15194895}, {"no": 15195852, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:05:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195830</a><br>they really hate musk. idk why, i&#039;ll never read those gay books", "time": 1676174741, "resto": 15194895}, {"no": 15195855, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:06:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195852</a><br>They&#039;re leftists.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

It&#039;s the best one price/quality-wise, because the money that doesn&#039;t get spent in a flimsy mount, actually goes to the telescope itself. Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

As such, the therapeutic effect on ADHD would not be subject to tolerance \u2014 apparently the biological mechanism at play here makes it \u201cimpossible to plug more sites than are already there.\u201d<br><br>The reason that most believe they are experiencing tolerance is because tolerance to the non-therapeutic effects (many of these are \u201cpositive\u201d) of stimulants is absolutely subject to a very steep tolerance curve.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

Only confusing thing is why &quot;A Transition to Advanced Mathematics&quot; isn&#039;t grouped together with Hammack and Velleman. It&#039;s literally another intro to proofs book (and definitely not more advanced than the other two), they&#039;re all kinda interchangeable.<br>I will say that Velleman should be the highlighted one in a graphic that&#039;s supposed to be &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot;. Velleman is by far the closest to being an informal introduction to logic and set theory (no surprise there since he did his phd under Kunen, so naturally his presentation will be quite foundationpilled).<br><br>The set theory books would be kinda out of place here, but since it&#039;s &quot;A Foundational Approach&quot; I&#039;ll give it a pass. And they&#039;re both very elementary and well written so good choices, but possibly questionable placement in the chart, especially if one is just coming from a book like Velleman which honestly already covers most of the important content in either set theory book, just in an informal manner.

No one else really contributed to modern civilization at all.

I&#039;m European and before university mathematics was my favourite subject and I went through the hardest mathematics grammar schools. It was my favourite because it was the only subject not dependent on rote anything, be it memory drill, or whatever. In this subject you could arrive at answers in tests through pure reasoning and not some rote piece of information you had to remember, such as was the case in history or biology. But as time went on and I met actual mathematicians and went to a pure maths program, it all quite ensoured me. In my early teenage years I&#039;ve not had particularly well developed critical thinking abilities. This meant I gave into the superstition of MBTI and through it I met MBTI communities. After realizing the nonsense it was, I returned to them and in there was a PhD graduate of pure mathematics. This person struggled to understand consistent human behavior across time is inherited through genetics, which are made up of a series of additive alleles, and how that entails the distribution of human behavior is gaussian, hence no binary dichotomy model such as MBTI could be valid. I tried to help him understand by explaining how that&#039;s exactly the same case as coin flips, hence the binomial, but he just wouldn&#039;t get it, and kept using ad hominem argumentation, without ever losing faith in his pseudoscience. And in regards of the pure maths program, there was nearly no reasoning. We&#039;ve had to remember 20 pages of definitions for god knows what reason from god knows where, essentially training us to be little bitchy parrots. When discussing having found a quicker solution, the TA agreed with my chain of reasoning, but said I should stick to the definition instead, with everyone glorifying drilling solving problems the way professor has done on the board over and over again, which made me remember this weaving-basket forum post of a humanities major trying mathematics and realizing it&#039;s all just a bunch", "filename": "image_2023-02-07_194919940", "ext": ".png", "w": 470, "h": 286, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1675795788451511, "time": 1675795788, "md5": "hCXeqcD5Btjt6x0knIbDCQ==", "fsize": 141142, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-having-a-crisis-of-faith-in-mathematics-im", "replies": 70, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 15184766, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)13:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15184765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15184765</a><br>of \u201cautists solving puzzles\u201d. As a child I briefly programmed in C, but in spite of being victorious in regional competitions, I quickly realized the people best at programming just keep programming all the time, and the tasks we were supposed to do in programming lessons or when I remembered programming were just so tedious and mundane. When I moved from C to Unity, I realized it was about remembering all the commands from all the various imported libraries, which I realized only several months of a quite fun time trying to figure out how to implement a region-triggered event. As such I decided never to touch programming again. But then seeing analysis in pure mathematics, that\u2019s exactly how it felt like. And it\u2019s even worse, because these people aren\u2019t gleaning anything interesting from what they\u2019re doing beyond a boundary, meaning they can\u2019t even put a definite finger on anything. I\u2019d rather have a statistician bullshit me than an analysis mathematician. I&#039;d always thought mathematics was the peak of human reasoning, but with all of what I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019m finding it hard to believe. Even looking at the structure of crystallized reasoning and the most complex jobs, writing ability, particularly as a form of composing written arguments, rises far above mathematics.
