Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

The math and boundary conditions set by Maxwell&#039;s Eq in linear media imply that the angular frequency, w, and the &quot;opposite&quot; component (or the xy component, or parallel to the boundary) of the wavenumber, k, are unchanged. The angular frequency part obviously means that the energy is conserved. This would not be true if it were non-linear media. Non-linear media is very very important in real life and are the subject of many experiments and irl applications. But of course they have little place in an undergrad treatment- all that im explaining rn would be told in such a course.<br><br>The Opposite-component of K in math words is k_1 sin(theta) = k_2 sin(theta). From your picture, theta is obviously different, so this means that for some reason k has changed when crossing the boundary, or more specifically the z-component (adjacent, or perpendicular to the boundary) of k has changed, which the boundary conditions allow. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;k is changed in linear media, meaning theta changes</span><br>Since w is the same but k is different, this means that in linear media the speed of how light moves changes, which is described by the index of refraction<br><br>Why does k change? Well k is associated with momentum, so the momentum of the light has changed. Kinda obvious from the picture. Where does the momentum come from?

This is analogous to the Judgment Day[34] of Christian mythology or the Revolution of Marxist mythology. The cataclysmic event is supposed to be followed by the arrival of techno-utopia (analogous to the Kingdom of God or the Worker&#039;s Paradise). Technianity has a favored minority\u2014the Elect\u2014consisting of the techies (equivalent to the True Believers of Christianity or the Proletariat of the Marxists[35]).

Dunno about shitty countries but in Scandinavia it doesn&#039;t seem like it. I think the main reason for your impression is that contrarians and retards are more entertaining and thus make the news and algorithms in disproportionate numbers. From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate. Abnormal ECGs were obtained in 51 (1.0%) of the students, of which 1 was diagnosed with mild myocarditis and another 4 were judged to have significant arrhythmia. None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously. Using these five students as a positive outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were 100% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac symptoms are common after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but the incidences of significant arrhythmias and myocarditis are only 0.1%. The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect but cost effect needs further discussed. What is Known: \u2022 The incidence of cardiac adverse effects was reported to be as high as 1.5 per 10 000 persons after the second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in the young male population based on the reporting system. What is New: \u2022 Through this mass ECG screening study after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine we found: (1) The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate; (2) the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%; (3) The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect.</span><br><br>I wonder why OP left this out?", "time": 1673756801, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125365, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>what&#039;s your point?", "time": 1673757512, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125389, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>meds.", "time": 1673758286, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125427, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but they&#039;ll be a lot less trusting.</span><br>that&#039;s a sign of intelligence. <br><br>Never trust authority figures.", "filename": "Joker World", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673759020239688, "time": 1673759020, "md5": "9U6pwGb5wPbnN+thWf9Fqg==", "fsize": 39430, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125432, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:05:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125197</a><br>kek!", "filename": "Vax Song", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1060, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673759122894624, "time": 1673759122, "md5": "bEbpEAOlMIE/YaOqG4V3Zw==", "fsize": 217959, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125365</a><br><a href=\"#p15125389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125389</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;17</span>% have cardiac symptoms guys!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously.</span><br>Cope.", "time": 1673761619, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125473, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically love the whole viruses aren&#039;t real gimmick and have been posting it a bunch everywhere.

To me the statues of romans look whiter than modern Italians and modern Italy is full of quasi Arabs who have produced a shit country and let its previous beauty fall to ruins or built over it. I suspect that people like Augustus had northern or central European ancestry, or romans had a highly idealised view of people of that phenotype hence why their statues and self depictions are all in that style. The former seems more likely to me as romans had a scathing view of germanic peoples. By late Rome though, I believe lots of mixing had gone on as everyone in the empire was considered a Roman at that time and they weren&#039;t xenophobic enough to preserve their own groups distinctive traits like their appearance and high culture. This is what is thought to have happened to neanderthals. They got absorbed into a populace who outbred and mixed with them (us) and their phenotype was lost in the process (mostly).", "time": 1673788013, "resto": 15121981}, {"no": 15126149, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)08:12:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126135</a><br>Maybe B\u00f6g-Olle H\u00e4stskosson and Fjollbj\u00f6rn Snorstr\u00f6m just know something that you don&#039;t, nigger.", "time": 1673788350, "resto": 15121981}, {"no": 15126162, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)08:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126149</a><br>Ah I see, you are trolling.

In reality, it is more common for children exposed to other children with Chicken Pox to NOT get chicken pox, but because we have been taught to believe in germ theory we have a confirmation bias skewed towards confirming the idea that things can spread. Therefore when we see a room of 20 children and 2 get sick we confirm the idea that those 2 spread the sick to each other, while ignoring the 18 children who did not get sick. We dismiss all other rational explanations, like the children have similar diets, the children were exposed to a cleaning chemical in the room which their bodies need to expel, etc. The spread has never been proven, it is just a belief that has been spread and then falsely confirmed by our brains tendency to filter information in favor of information it has been previously supplied. </span><br>- Lauren Whiteman", "filename": "96f3ced4196716f14a120b1ebf27f1fc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 593, "h": 900, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673792053753181, "time": 1673792053, "md5": "R1kYQcx+agPaH7Y+XLVz4w==", "fsize": 132968, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126244, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:18:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126238</a><br>weird I got it from having my parents take me to a chickenpox party then I spent the next few days miserable", "time": 1673792286, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126252, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:21:39", "name": "Viruses don&#039;t exist", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126244</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I got</span><br>again, &quot;personal story&quot; shillshit from anonymous faggot", "time": 1673792499, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126501, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:15:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126244</a><br>Lies. <br>I had the pox. <br>10 or children over they get it too. <br>And 2 of my cousins. <br>None got them. <br>How? <br>Why? <br>We even had to play really touchy games.<br>And drick from the same cup and al this retarded stuff. <br><br>None got sick. <br>And none had it before. <br>This story got brought up every fucking family dinner.<br><br>Also I had 3 room mates. <br>Who got sick at least 2-4 times a year. <br>And I got never sick. <br><br>And I wondered why... <br>Now I am pretty much sure, it was because they got hardcore drunk almost every weekend and me not.", "time": 1673802913, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126511, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:21:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wow, yet another enlightening thread about vaccines.", "time": 1673803301, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126521, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:26:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15113841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15113841</a><br>it is not &quot;rare&quot; it is actually rare.", "time": 1673803615, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126522, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:28:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15113871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15113871</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;true survivors of C19 for not being sheeps.</span><br>true brainwashed wannabe alt-right retards", "time": 1673803685, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126740, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)14:04:58", "name": "Monadas", "com": "<a href=\"#p15115967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15115967</a><br>As far as I understand (not a virologist), this might be correct.", "time": 1673809498, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126825, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)14:41:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15126522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15126522</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything I don&#039;t like is my political boogeyman that doesn&#039;t even exist beyond a buzzword the news uses</span>", "time": 1673811677, "resto": 15113841}, {"no": 15126949, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)15:30:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15115967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15115967</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mRNA itself</span><br>Do you mean naked mRNA after it has been released from the LNP and somehow escaped the cell and ended up in the bloodstream?

Elon can via Tesla submit a consultation contract to SpaceX in assistance of ramping 304SS technologies at volume production.

These experiments involved a range of research topics, including studying disease, survival in extreme conditions, and equipment testing. The experiments often endangered the health of the COs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minnesota Starvation Study was divided into four phases: A twelve-week baseline control phase; a 24-week starvation phase, causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of his pre-starvation body weight; and 2 recovery phases, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried.

College is a huge financial investment, but then without it, you stand to earn FAR less money over the course of your lifetime than if you have one. <br><br>For example, going to Law school for 3 years at a top 50 Law school in America will put you 200-300k in debt, easy. But then we&#039;re to remark, if you are top 20% of your class at those schools, you are likely to be recruited by a top law firm or corporate law division where the starting salary is usually around 160,00k, sometimes more if you&#039;ve internshipped and networked well during your summers. <br><br>So 300k sounds like a ton. 3-5 years working at a top firm with that investment, you will have paid off all of it. My friend graduated from Georgetown Law Center in 2020, I don&#039;t know where he was ranked in his class, but he was recruited by JP Morgan. He makes 220,000 a year there, and he has already paid off his $280,000 student loans in two years. He is currently looking for work in the tech world at big tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook, etc, has several interviews already for them. He&#039;ll probably secure a job at one of them in the coming weeks, and move to California, making the same money or more, no debt, and only green pastures ahead.<br><br>A Law degree is a huge investment, but once you have it, it is a Golden Ticket. Lawyers run Movie studios, Baseball teams, work in politics, finance, hold top positions at Universities, etc. IMO a JD degree is the best degree to get right now if, first of all, you like law and reasoning, but second if you are personable, pleasent, and have some level of charm about you, and are able to market your abilities relative to the degree discipline. Law covers Philosophy, reasoning, Literature, Latin, Greek, you are well versed in the legal code in most every discipline.

For example: the distinction between listening and hearing. Hearing is to absorb sound generally.

That&#039;s different than listening, which is to intake and process the meaning or message of some one or thing specifcally.

A component of the historical and philosophical legacy of science is the belief in the primacy of European institutions, practices, and conceptual schemes to the exclusion of others (Harding, 1998). If science as a field reflects the institutionalization of dominant power structures, then Asian American women scientists, as reflected by the women in this study, manifest and personify these systems and power structures through the hierarchy in their identities, where some identities become privileged above others. This culture and environment not only diminishes the complexities and nuances of individual identities but also stifles epistemic inclusion. Thus, simultaneously unraveling and deconstructing the various threads of race, gender, and science allows a deeper, more nuanced exploration of science as it is currently defined and understood to reconceptualize science and weave these threads into new patterns, thereby redefining,revolutionizing, and transforming science at its core.", "filename": "PherD Asian womxn", "ext": ".png", "w": 1216, "h": 1388, "tn_w": 219, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673710224731690, "time": 1673710224, "md5": "EYp00nOT01B0+sz0sapexw==", "fsize": 312692, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "there-is-a-strange-contradiction-among-scientists", "replies": 22, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 15123542, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:37:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15123527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15123527</a><br>I read the image abstract but I have no idea what it even means?", "time": 1673710633, "resto": 15123527}, {"no": 15123545, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:39:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15123527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15123527</a><br>My favorite variation of this is rediscovering known laws in physics and reinventing math, because the development of these ideas are tied up with colonialism.", "time": 1673710795, "resto": 15123527}, {"no": 15123548, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:41:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15123542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15123542</a><br>asians are overrepresented in stem. women are underrepresented in stem. therefore it&#039;s unclear where asian women fall under the umbrella of social justice. this in itself constitutes a unique group, and therefore an underprivileged group, and we need to hear their voices.", "time": 1673710864, "resto": 15123527}, {"no": 15123549, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15123542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15123542</a><br>I&#039;ll redpill you on it: from lots of &quot;postmodern&quot; theory, they have realised you can make up petit recits or little stories about the world, rather than huge metanarratives like &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; which dominate people&#039;s perspectives, even if it pretends to be &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;True.&quot; Then these people turn around and say they&#039;d just make up their own form of self-reflective, or reflexive, theories which do not ascend to be all &quot;True&quot; although they may uplift female, Indigenous, black, Asian, queer, etc., lived experience as &quot;valid.&quot; <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR</span><br>They basically just make up their own form of knowledge because it&#039;s not White/Male.
