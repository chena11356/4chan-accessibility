I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

Meanwhile, Jews dominate verbal IQ, being almost one S.D. above Whites, while having normal sized brains and unremarkable visuospatial IQ.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apart from auxological factors, which was emphasized by Richard Lynn, performance also increases with greater training, an observation that was stressed more by James Flynn. One study (Armstrong et al., 2014) discovered a correlation between the FLynn effect on various tests, and the extent to which said tests are rule-dependent. Rule-dependent tests, in turn, benefit from retesting effects and the progressively greater emphasis on abstract thinking skills in schooling during the course of the 20th century. Raven\u2019s maxes out on both factors, and has consequently seen the greatest increase.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Verbal skills, in contrast, benefit little if at all from greater brain size, and children in the developed world were already getting very stringently trained on it even a century ago. Even brutally so (spare the rod and spoil the child; one beaten is worth two unbeaten; etc.). OTOH, there must have been a large improvement in average verbal proficiency between, say, 1600 and 1900.</span>", "filename": "brain size map", "ext": ".png", "w": 1227, "h": 597, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 60, "tim": 1671842048784286, "time": 1671842048, "md5": "K/AgTsA7jKbFBOGsTuCvyQ==", "fsize": 25908, "resto": 15074082}, {"no": 15074596, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:02:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I have exceptional skills in spatial and verbal ability, pattern recognition and logic, but I suck at twerking, music and celebrity gossip.

round, you can use a number of different methods. One way to do this is to measure the object&#039;s diameter in multiple places using a ruler or caliper, and then compare the measurements to see if they are all equal. If the measurements are all the same, it is likely that the object is perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another way to test the roundness of an object is to use a roundness tester, which is a specialized tool that is designed to measure the roundness of an object. This tool typically consists of a rotating spindle with a stylus that is used to trace the contour of the object being tested. By analyzing the trace left by the stylus, the roundness tester can determine the degree of roundness of the object.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another method that can be used to test the roundness of an object is to roll the object along a flat surface and observe its movement. If the object rolls smoothly and consistently without wobbling or deviating from its path, it is likely to be perfectly round.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finally, you can also use a high-resolution 3D scanner to create a digital model of the object and then use computer software to analyze the model to determine its roundness. This method is highly accurate and can be used to measure the roundness of objects with a high degree of precision.</span>", "time": 1671775887, "resto": 15072501}, {"no": 15072654, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)01:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15072630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15072630</a><br>This begs the question, how round are the most round objects?

In my opinion, having a mentor actually work with you/assist/advise you is more important than having a fancy name on the paperwork, even if that name can open more doors for you later on, but thats just my opinion.

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them. I don&#039;t have much knowledge about the application side but I&#039;ve heard (from researchers in fluid dynamics) that standard numerical solvers are faster (this of course depends on what you want to do).<br><br>I can see two interesting parts that I&#039;m currently pursuing. First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

For example their schizo ravings about Elon musk mindcontrolling them with brainchips they cribbed from Deus Ex. While they exaggerate absurdly a valid and realistic concern is information interface utilities in phone RRS apps and social media. These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers.

You need to have a way to convey some kind of information in order to convey a shared language in the first place.<br>Which is why thoughts and emotions have been out of the scope so far.

The present study used structural magnetic imaging to examine gray matter (GM) volumes among 27 men with schizophrenia preceded by CD (SZ+CD), 23 men with schizophrenia but without CD (SZ\u2013CD), 27 men with CD only (CD), and 25 healthy (H) men. The groups with schizophrenia were similar in terms of age of onset and duration of illness, levels of psychotic symptoms, and medication. The 2 groups with CD were similar as to number of CD symptoms, lifelong aggressive behavior, and number of criminal convictions. Men with SZ+CD, relative to those with SZ\u2013CD, displayed (1) increased GM volumes in the hypothalamus, the left putamen, the right cuneus/precuneus, and the right inferior parietal cortex after controlling for age, alcohol, and drug misuse and (2) decreased GM volumes in the inferior frontal region. Men with SZ+CD (relative to the SZ\u2013CD group) and CD (relative to the H group) displayed increased GM volumes of the hypothalamus and the inferior and superior parietal lobes, which were not associated with substance misuse. Aggressive behavior, both prior to age 15 and lifetime tendency, was positively correlated with the GM volume of the hypothalamus. Thus, among males, SZ+CD represents a distinct subtype of schizophrenia. Although differences in behavior emerge in childhood and remain stable through adulthood, further research is needed to determine whether the differences in GM volumes result from abnormal neural development distinct from that of other males developing schizophrenia.</span><br>What explains this?", "filename": "1671829786414227", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 804, "h": 825, "tn_w": 243, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671844439381493, "time": 1671844439, "md5": "7SQO/axBIjrdWn8oehjyPg==", "fsize": 75771, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "apparantly-a-minority-of-people-with-conduct", "replies": 2, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 15074128, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:24:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I used to think pepe was a 9gag tier meme only children posted but after I did a copious amount of edibles daily for 3 years and I destroyed my brain I post pepe with every post I make", "filename": "1660018796264", "ext": ".png", "w": 550, "h": 531, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1671845080048500, "time": 1671845080, "md5": "VhyFeOxJTfLaGbfMBvZcbg==", "fsize": 231166, "resto": 15074120}, {"no": 15074130, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:25:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15074128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15074128</a><br>Sorry, I meant to post this in a different thread on a different board", "time": 1671845153, "resto": 15074120}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15069976, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:14:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why does he never date a deformed/retarded girl?", "filename": "287CB4FE-A663-445C-8195-F7A62C9300B2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1058, "h": 356, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1671675269007580, "time": 1671675269, "md5": "dOsUz+jmmpE4RDSP9voW4w==", "fsize": 223763, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-does-he-never-date-a-deformedretarded-girl", "replies": 18, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 17}, {"no": 15070091, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:24:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efU<wbr>A6W5HEv4&amp;ab_channel=SpecialBooksbyS<wbr>pecialKids<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;accidentally click one of his videos</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;feed is now filled with spergs and monstrosities</span>", "time": 1671679473, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070095, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:26:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Literally who?<br>If you have to watch a science/math video with someone&#039;s face in it, you&#039;re a retard", "time": 1671679615, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070131, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:42:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070095</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;If you have to watch a science/math video with someone&#039;s face in it, you&#039;re a retard</span><br>pleb", "filename": "Mirror Lenses Part 2 Testing the Modulation Transfer Function. 00.20.05.120-00.20.09.240 01", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671680533416887, "time": 1671680533, "md5": "nAJFOhVyxly6/czt1Q0e7w==", "fsize": 2097328, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070139, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:46:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15069976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15069976</a><br>uncanny valley off the charts everytime i see these channels", "time": 1671680803, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070898, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)09:52:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15070131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15070131</a><br>I miss based Trump like you wouldn\u2019t believe", "time": 1671720726, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070906, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)09:58:28", "name": "Jealous", "com": "Pizzagate", "filename": "TIMESAND___700xxx762XXX777", "ext": ".png", "w": 1428, "h": 1496, "tn_w": 119, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671721108896337, "time": 1671721108, "md5": "VZXpkPSSy1fy7tnx+LGkVg==", "fsize": 231598, "resto": 15069976}, {"no": 15070973, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)10:28:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15069976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15069976</a><br>I don&#039;t know who these people are, I don&#039;t care who these people are.

As a matter of interest, centrifugal loads may be from 6 to 12 tons at the blade root of two to four passenger helicopters.

If gross weight and G-forces are constant, decreasing RPM will cause increased coning.

I once went home and found three gorgeous women waiting for me in my bed in sexy outfits - all taller than me I might add (my little sister happened to be with me at the time - she was visiting; awkward). The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases. Don&#039;t waste time chasing skirts. It&#039;s fun at the time, but you&#039;ll look back and realize it was mostly pointless. Hope this helps.

The reason is because modern height is less genetic and largely environmental. Newer generations have hormones that are completely out of wack and are constantly subjected to synthetic, artificial and free radical hormones and chemicals since birth and on of the side effects of that is that we grow taller.

Nature and biology seeks a baseline or mean, anything that deviates too far to either side would struggle to survive in any biological system. We as humans only get to propagate these issues because we live in an environment largely detached from natural amd biological factors.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

I am using opencv in Python to capture still images from many cameras at once. Unfortunately I have found that the cheap 2MP USB cameras that I am using allocate an amount of bandwidth from the USB controller that assumes I&#039;ll be operating them at 30fps, which means that I can only open 1 or 2 at a time. The frame rate appears to be not controllable with these cameras from within opencv, nor from v4l in the linux command line where a frame rate property is not listed when I run $v4l2-ctl -d 0 --list-ctrls. Otherwise I was hoping I could simply set frame rate to 0fps, allowing me to open as many cameras as I want and capture from them as needed (assuming that&#039;s how it works). However it appears that I cannot open all of the cameras at the same time, which is unfortunate because opencv VideoCapture objects apparently have this handy grab-retrive paradigm that I can&#039;t make use of. Instead what I am doing is opening each camera, reading image, then closing... It takes a long time and is totally unnecessary from a hardware point of view, since I only want to grab single frames from each camera. From the USB controller&#039;s perspective, I don&#039;t have enough bandwidth.<br><br>Now I have bought a 5MP camera that I thought might have more options. Indeed it appears I can capture 2MP images from this camera at 6fps, so it seems I would be able to open more cameras at a time in Python.

Being cowabunga cool, while navigating NPC vibes to properly wield power, and respond agreeably to power and norms and biases. Life is mostly a rhetorical question.<br>Even in a culture of science, even in a university or career... Unless you are privately working at something extremely competitive, difficult and performance dependent as positive expectation gambler, or small time investor, where something depends on actual right/wrong answers, then you are playing in a rhetorical universe. <br>That rhetorical universe as well as humans cognitive weakness (although we are extremely intelligent on paper/ in terms of straight thinking, we are much dumber when cognitive biases are exploited).

Each heat wave is further evidence that conditions are getting worse.<br><br>OP. So, some Earth science for you. Earth&#039;s atmosphere is divided into cells, called Hadley cells. Hot air rises and because the equator is hit by more sunlight year round it heats faster than the rest of the planet. This warm wet air rises and loses heat and moisture until it reaches the stratosphere where Ozone is heated by short wave ultraviolet light from the sun making the bottom of the stratosphere warmer than the top of the troposphere. This forces the now cool dry air down and is why the troposphere has it&#039;s name &#039;tropo&#039; being Greek for &#039;turning over&#039; or rotating. Because of the Earth&#039;s spin this cool dry air lands about the 30th parallel north and south of the Equator which is where the two main desert belts come from around the world.<br><br>Air circulates again, heats up over the Earth as it moves north or south away from the boundary of the Hadley cell until it reaches the polar cell. Near the poles forming the boundary to the two Polar cells where heat again rises, forced up by a pressure difference between it and the cold dry air of the polar regions of the Earth. It then cools and dries again until it falls over the poles and circulates back down.<br><br>This is your first lesson of Meteorology 1", "filename": "ahrens_0721", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 903, "h": 765, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1671755371885455, "time": 1671755371, "md5": "Eq/i6gl5TlOtoLOjkcdCRQ==", "fsize": 121815, "resto": 15071880}, {"no": 15071986, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:32:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15071958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15071958</a><br>yeah and they do their whole &quot;you&#039;re denying science&quot; routine and it&#039;s like trying to wrangle a tantrum throwing toddler. fortunately i don&#039;t have to interact with those types as much these days.", "time": 1671755565, "resto": 15071880}, {"no": 15071991, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:35:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15071981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15071981</a><br>Lesson 2.
