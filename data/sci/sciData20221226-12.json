I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

This isn&#039;t about left or right. This is about whether you are pro- or anti-censorship. You are clearly pro-censorship, but most socialists and progressives like myself tend to support free speech and academic freedom.

Now I genuinely don&#039;t know much about nuclear power and don&#039;t have a strong feeling about it either way, but I certainly don&#039;t think tech companies, researchers, or social media should restrict discussion of these topics on the part of humans or AI. It has nothing to do with my position on any particular issue. I believe in anthropogenic climate change, for instance, and I actually think it&#039;s a very serious problem and on of my main political concerns, but I still don&#039;t think climate change deniers should be censored on social media. It&#039;s weird too because tech companies and neolibs don&#039;t even really care about climate change, but they&#039;re perfectly happy to use the issue as a pretext to censor people.

There has been many more countries and areas brought into production, new techniques, to increase the overall amount of oil and oil equivalent than can be produced, but at much higher prices. US gas prices in the early 70s was $0.25/gallon. Earlier this year it was about $5/gallon - depending on location. The higher prices are required for the newer technologies, more difficult locations, new refining or more difficult to refine products, and what you do not immediately see the effects of low interest rates, tax breaks, and other incentives from various governments. Also, the major and minor wars going on are all about the control of oil/gas production, transportation, refining, and distribution. The major governments and oil majors have all fields mapped, developed, produced, and there are detailed strategies and plans to deal with the &quot;decline&quot; in production.

Molecular adhesion can only occur when a wet material is applied and dries while maintaining contact with the surface.

If a surface is constantly vibrating, wet material; tomato sauce, for instance; will not have a chance to form a bond.<br><br>These bonds are not based upon micro-crevices, as is widely believed; a belief promoted by the DuPont company over the years; but rather, raised peaks in material around which carbon compounds latch on to as they dehydrate and therefore contract. If this contraction happens before the carbon compounds can situate themselves around the spikes (like a horseshoe around a pole) the adhesion patterns that make dish cleaning a challenge will not present themselves as food would be less prone to sticking than with even a chemical non-stick coating.<br><br>As long as a surface is in constant, relative motion, no matter how small the increment, no food will stick to that surface.

The present study used structural magnetic imaging to examine gray matter (GM) volumes among 27 men with schizophrenia preceded by CD (SZ+CD), 23 men with schizophrenia but without CD (SZ\u2013CD), 27 men with CD only (CD), and 25 healthy (H) men. The groups with schizophrenia were similar in terms of age of onset and duration of illness, levels of psychotic symptoms, and medication. The 2 groups with CD were similar as to number of CD symptoms, lifelong aggressive behavior, and number of criminal convictions. Men with SZ+CD, relative to those with SZ\u2013CD, displayed (1) increased GM volumes in the hypothalamus, the left putamen, the right cuneus/precuneus, and the right inferior parietal cortex after controlling for age, alcohol, and drug misuse and (2) decreased GM volumes in the inferior frontal region. Men with SZ+CD (relative to the SZ\u2013CD group) and CD (relative to the H group) displayed increased GM volumes of the hypothalamus and the inferior and superior parietal lobes, which were not associated with substance misuse. Aggressive behavior, both prior to age 15 and lifetime tendency, was positively correlated with the GM volume of the hypothalamus. Thus, among males, SZ+CD represents a distinct subtype of schizophrenia. Although differences in behavior emerge in childhood and remain stable through adulthood, further research is needed to determine whether the differences in GM volumes result from abnormal neural development distinct from that of other males developing schizophrenia.</span><br>What explains this?", "filename": "1671829786414227", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 804, "h": 825, "tn_w": 243, "tn_h": 250,

It&#039;s unfortunate because this report is simply starting the conclusion of a detailed analysis, it says nothing of conspiracy theories, but it doesn&#039;t look good for the government so now people jump into action because they&#039;ve been told the government would never lie so this report must be a conspiracy theory then", "time": 1671977737, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076874, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:35:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;23 years later</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still seething about it</span><br>Has any other event in the history of humanity mindbroken so many idiots?", "time": 1671978939, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076881, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:40:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15076874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15076874</a><br>covid", "time": 1671979227, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076884, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:44:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15075860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15075860</a><br>Only if the floors were indestructable.", "time": 1671979464, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076887, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:45:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15076874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15076874</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;23 years later</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still living under the sordid consequences of gullible retards believeing it was done by desert goatfuckers</span><br>It&#039;s clear now that all your likes should have been shot on the spot back then.", "time": 1671979554, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076889, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:46:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15076822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15076822</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Except it literally was designed to withstand impact from a jumbo jet.</span><br>It withstood the impact, didn&#039;t withstands the fires that resulted from the impact.", "time": 1671979595, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076895, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:50:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15076889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15076889</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it withstood the impact</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it just collapsed at freefall speed shortly afterwards</span><br>Government narrativism is an incurable mental illness.", "time": 1671979810, "resto": 15075625}, {"no": 15076897, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)09:51:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15075878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15075878</a><br>This paper an obvious fraud.

Fine plaster dust settled onto heads and shoulders \u2013 the invariable dandruff of air raids. Unlike other people, though, Cleaver and Clarke and co. knew immediately how to interpret the blast that had happened suddenly, without the sound of bombers overhead, and even more revealing, the strange rising boom afterwards, as air rushed in to fill the tube of vacuum the rocket had drilled down the sky. They knew what messenger of the future had just burst into the Dickensian darkness of the saloon. This was not the first V2 to hit London: the government had been covering up the attacks with stories of exploding gas mains for a little while, and already scientists from the Royal Aircraft Establishment were secretly collecting twisted fragments of Wernher von Braun\u2019s precision engineering and trying to put the shattered jigsaw back together in a Farnborough hangar.

I&#039;m glad you asked -<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Future interstellar rockets may use laser-induced annihilation reactions for relativistic drive</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interstellar probes and future interstellar travel will require relativistic rockets. The problem is that such a rocket drive requires that the rocket exhaust velocity from the fuel also is relativistic, since otherwise the rocket thrust is much too small: the total mass of the fuel will be so large that relativistic speeds cannot be reached in a reasonable time and the total mass of the rocket will be extremely large. Until now, no technology was known that would be able to give rocket exhaust at relativistic speed and a high enough momentum for relativistic travel. Here, a useful method for relativistic interstellar propulsion is described for the first time. This method gives exhaust at relativistic speeds and is a factor of at least one hundred better than normal fusion due to its increased energy output from the annihilation-like meson formation processes. It uses ordinary hydrogen as fuel so a return travel is possible after refuelling almost anywhere in space. The central nuclear processes have been studied in around 20 publications, which is considered to be sufficient evidence for the general properties. The nuclear processes give relativistic particles (kaons, pions and muons) by laser-induced annihilation-like processes in ultra-dense hydrogen H(0). The kinetic energy of the mesons is 1300 times larger than the energy of the laser pulse. This method is superior to the laser-sail method by several orders of magnitude and is suitable for large spaceships.</span><br>https://www.sciencedirect.com/scien<wbr>ce/article/pii/S0094576520303179#bi<wbr>b6", "filename": "Holmlid laser h drive", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 464, "h": 401, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1671980391936195, "time": 1671980391, "md5": "jdF6qnXBExnSWVs3fHk1Lg==", "fsize": 16152, "resto": 15074705}, {"no": 15076912, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:01:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15076875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15076875</a><br>Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed are the welfare niggas who will never stop slurping away resources from projects that actually matter.

On the other hand, expulsion of charged stellar material slows the star&#039;s rotation down due to conservation of angular momentum so if this &quot;stellar magnetic breaking&quot; is too LOW, then the mass of the star doesn&#039;t decline over time and thus the orbiting planets experience orbital decay.

For example their schizo ravings about Elon musk mindcontrolling them with brainchips they cribbed from Deus Ex. While they exaggerate absurdly a valid and realistic concern is information interface utilities in phone RRS apps and social media. These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers.

You need to have a way to convey some kind of information in order to convey a shared language in the first place.<br>Which is why thoughts and emotions have been out of the scope so far. Conveying the meanings of a verbal language is aided by gestures and examples. Say sound -&gt;point to green object -&gt;repeat sound -&gt;point towards a second object that only share the characteristics of being green. <br><br>As you mention early versions of a chip like this would be limited to very basic electric signalling No. What the starting point would be is analogues to something like Euclid&#039;s elements. We need a baseline. Our point in space and definition of a line. Like Euclid&#039;s work it&#039;ll probably only be a simplified definition but it&#039;ll work for now. <br>I think the emotions that are best suited as our reference points are the most ingrained primal ones we have.

If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world).

Tegmark has a brought experiment on this to open Our Mathematical Universe. Neurons can be one ion away from firing. A single calcium ion inside a neuron can be in super position.
