He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was magistrate of Jincheng at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. Thus a serpent or some kind of marine snake (chhen) had certainly been turned to stone, as happens with the &#039;stone-crabs&#039;.[13][14]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was thus revealed. It contained several hundred bamboo with their roots and trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in Wuzhou there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though they are not produced in that place today. This is a very strange thing.[14][15]</span><br>Does anyone know what kind of &quot;serpent&quot; fossil would that have been?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream<wbr>_Pool_Essays#Geological_theory", "filename": "1672396487024", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 804, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 167, "tim": 1672396921831065, "time": 1672396921, "md5": "ENAvDqbykuji2MTevyUjvg==", "fsize": 769932, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fossil-encounters-by-ancient-people", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 15087814, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)07:37:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15087692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15087692</a><br>most likely a juvenile chinese dragon", "time": 1672403842, "resto": 15087692}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15069532, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:52:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Schizo-science thread.", "com": "Post em.", "filename": "Daniel Martin Diaz", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671663163567284, "time": 1671663163, "md5": "xXVm+H4DnOiW7BWUPttGkA==", "fsize": 947144, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "schizoscience-thread", "replies": 213, "images": 110, "unique_ips": 81}, {"no": 15069534, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:53:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 896, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1671663218937092, "time": 1671663218, "md5": "67BvXlW3UTJsQCSzBEWycw==", "fsize": 1660611, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069539, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:54:53", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 564, "h": 766, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671663293030837, "time": 1671663293, "md5": "HQQp1AQ3HbmhABideLw5lw==", "fsize": 914990, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069544, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:56:09", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 499, "h": 770, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671663369860383, "time": 1671663369, "md5": "XU/XLui+eDVZA4w8hZ7kXQ==", "fsize": 723321, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069547, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:56:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15069532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15069532</a><br>SteAm", "time": 1671663386, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069550, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 564, "h": 784, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671663506659441, "time": 1671663506, "md5": "zN/Et2nZaZtzGpbsaelkkg==", "fsize": 638207, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069553, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:59:50", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "596148B0-005A-4883-A10A-5B63AE83F148", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671663590125386, "time": 1671663590, "md5": "/HxtsVbbQwJrbeNcsKEvXw==", "fsize": 23364, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069557, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 564, "h": 720, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671663677807411, "time": 1671663677, "md5": "Yws9YCYzkSiXui1PhwO/LQ==", "fsize": 389784, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069580, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:11:08", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 564, "h": 515, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1671664268051509, "time": 1671664268, "md5": "wumXx6+Kio4Qxk2aZS7a7w==", "fsize": 213831, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069590, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:14:13", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 564, "h": 712, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671664453041937, "time": 1671664453, "md5": "vnQj11C6zHbgKXqx9ay6aA==", "fsize": 989469, "resto": 15069532}, {"no": 15069769, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:25:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "based, i used to get banned setting these up. these are good ways of inspiring poly (many) -

The only difference is that women do not produce as much testosterone to convert into dihydrotestosterone as they lack testicles. Thus, when additional testosterone has been prescribed, the same result shall occur for the female as the male. Do not misunderstand, high testosterone is not the culprit. It is high dihydrotestosterone which came from a portion of testosterone available. I think the thing in this picture is a type of proof of this theory.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

A December 2022 summary of meetings with the White House by Lauren Culbertson, Twitter\u2019s Head of U.S. Public Policy, adds new evidence of the White House\u2019s pressure campaign, and cements that it repeatedly attempted to directly influence the platform. <br><br>12. Culbertson wrote that the Biden team was \u201cvery angry\u201d that Twitter had not been more aggressive in deplatforming multiple accounts. They wanted Twitter to do more.<br><br>13. Twitter executives did not fully capitulate to the Biden team\u2019s wishes. An extensive review of internal communications at the company revealed employees often debating moderation cases in great detail, and with more care than was shown by the government toward free speech. <br><br>14. But Twitter did suppress views\u2014many from doctors and scientific experts\u2014that conflicted with the official positions of the White House. As a result, legitimate findings and questions that would have expanded the public debate went missing. <br><br>15. There were three serious problems with Twitter\u2019s process:<br>First, much of the content moderation was conducted by bots, trained on machine learning and AI \u2013 impressive in their engineering, yet still too crude for such nuanced work. <br><br>16. Second, contractors, in places like the Philippines, also moderated content.

Inevitably, dissident yet legitimate content was labeled as misinformation, and the accounts of doctors and others were suspended both for tweeting opinions and demonstrably true information. <br><br>20.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan.

Outside of the hard sciences everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Hell, even some area of the hard sciences are highly suspect (e.g. String Theory). Many people, including those in scientific fields, have a very cargo cult approach to science. To them science is something published in a respectable enough journal and with p&lt;0.05. The soft sciences have been a joke for decades and are effectively just a propaganda arm for the Party. I don&#039;t think scientific inquiry will grind to a halt, but it will slow down, and some research will become verboten in the west. This is a list of things that I think we will not research anymore in the near future:<br>- nuclear fission for power generation (The money is on fusion now)<br>- heritability of human traits and in general everything that could show inherent disparity in abilities between humans and between human groups<br>- gain of function research (just kidding lol)<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672337652, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086184, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:15:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15086180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15086180</a><br>I&#039;m especially mad about the current situation of nuclear research. I can sort of accept the pozzing of research that goes directly against the dogmas of the woke religion, but the corruption of nuclear research really shows how power driven scientists have become. To the layman the recent breakthrough in fusion sounds like a great achievement but to someone who has actually mastered elementary school mathematics it only shows how scientist would lie (mostly by omission, but that&#039;s still a lie) only to gain funding and status for themselves. We could phase out fossil fuels in less than a decade, for electricity generation at least, using the nuclear technology we already have. If you want to get fancy you could start building pilot power plants based on the Thorium cycle and/or other new gen reactors. Instead we are funding boondoggles like fusion that will likely not be able to generate useful power for the next few decades. Or pouring money in meme stuff like renewables and hydrogen. To work well science requires a rather high degree of honesty, a degree of honesty that is above the paygrade of most people. Unfortunately I think academia is selecting for ass kissing, grinding and cheating abilities, none of which correlate strongly with honesty. <br><br>2/2", "time": 1672337739, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086206, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15078421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15078421</a><br>you are making the wrong assumptions.

Nobody is talking about the &quot;rate&quot; of warming 125,000 years ago. You clearly don&#039;t know the subject material you&#039;re arguing. The mention of 125kya is about the TEMPERATURE. It was quite a bit warmer then. It wasn&#039;t &quot;warming&quot;. That was the peak. The more significant warming was from 20kya to 8kya. And you know how we know it was ACTUALLY warming? Because the biomes changed and coastlines flooded. Nobody was measuring sea level rise with toothpicks laid on their sides.<br><br>The problem is you have ABSOLUTE FAITH in faulty methodology from soientists who are actively chasing a pre-determined outcome. The reality doesn&#039;t match the data. You can&#039;t change that. The biggest lie about &quot;global warming&quot; consequences is that almost all of them are caused by destruction of the environment, not the burning of fossil fuels. Why are there more droughts and catestrophic floods? Because that&#039;s what happens when you remove all the vegetation that sponges up the extra water and slowly releases it during dry periods. It&#039;s also why all the rivers in America have dropped. No global warming alarmist wants to talk about that though. Why are coral reefs dying? Is it global warming? Nope. It&#039;s because they&#039;re being smothered with agricultural runoff and literal human sewage. Are the ice sheets actually receding? Not really. So what about the ocean levels? Maybe?

Any other take is simple propoganda and indoctrination.<br><br>There may have been issues with the natives in the mid to late 19th century to which I am ignorant of, and that is the next step in my own personal research. But regardless as to the specific way of life our founders lead, they believed in very high moral calling and had an enormous belief in the power of the human spirit. That is highly admirable, even if they came from upper middle class homes, and even if Jefferson had a few moments of weakness which resulted in bastard children. Franklin as well. It would be arrogant to ignore all of the great good and progress they made in our founding and the ideals they had to our nation because of a few vices.

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

You&#039;re technically phasing through the simulation constantly but the simulation compensates for this by adjusting positions proportionally based on mass. At a high enough velocity/energy getting stuff to phase through is really trivial, academics naively call this &quot;quantum tunneling&quot; based off their misunderstanding of reality. The trick to phase with macroscopic low-velocity entities is to exploit the compensation of the collision detection.
