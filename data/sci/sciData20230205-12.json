Well, anyway, here&#039;s a direct quote from him from 2010<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me. When our Foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health. That was the main thing we did because I thought population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face. You\u2019ve got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to do that. That\u2019s the only thing that really counts. Well then I came across articles that showed that the key thing you can do to reduce population growth is actually improve health. And that sounds paradoxical. You think, \u2018OK, better health means more kids not less kids.\u2019</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWell in fact, what parents are doing is they\u2019re trying to have two kids survive to adulthood to take care of them. And so, the more disease burden that there is, the more kids they have to have to have that high probability. So there\u2019s a perfect correlation that as you improve health, within a half generation the population growth rate goes down. In fact Hans Rosling, here at this conference, in two of my favorite speeches, actually showed that unbelievable correlation that population growth has gone down. Today, where is there high population growth? It\u2019s in the places with the worst health conditions \u2013 northern Nigeria, northern India. And so the two problems go exactly hand in hand. If we improve health rapidly we will get the peak population to be as much as a billion below the current expected peak. That is about 8.3 billion versus 9.3.\u201d</span><br><br>So I guess that&#039;s how he thinks, take it as you will", "time": 1675518875, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177064, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:59:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15177056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15177056</a><br>so he want to increase health by reducing the population, and reducing the population by vaccination.<br>make sense", "time": 1675519170, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177067, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)09:08:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15176915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15176915</a><br>gates is a retard if he is such a pleb he really thinks mars is the be all, end all.

Most companies are struggling to get their data structured enough to do actual ML/AI memery. Add in all the legacy systems and poor data management and you get a very comfy jobmarket.<br><br>If you know SQL, Python, Excel (lmao) and AWS/Azure then there are a lot of opportunities in building ML infrastructure, and honestly I think that&#039;s the best angle to eventually get into &quot;pure&quot; ML. <br><br>I started in data engineering building pipelines for non-ML purposes and migrating databases, and because I had a lot of experience with the specific datasets and structure I moved into doing ML related pipelines and general data management. After doing that for a while I ended up knowing the ML parts better than the ML-engineers, got transferred + promoted, and now I&#039;m working with a lot more fun ML and CS&amp;E projects<br><br><a href=\"#p15178958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15178958</a><br>Depends on the industries available where you are and/or that you are interested in.

Is there medication that just flows around, occasionally doing its thing until it gets, for example, eliminated by the kidney?</span><br>Yes that&#039;s it, lots of medications work that way, they don&#039;t permanently bond, they interact in a statistical likelihood depending on their concentration, so it&#039;s in a balance like any chemical reaction. So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

Come up with an idea and make a startup business, or join an existing startup. Teaching yourself programming opens up a lot of opportunities, mostly full stack web development because then you can create a whole product yourself. It helps if you&#039;re confident with talking to people and just being around people in general, a lot of programmers aren&#039;t, including myself. Running a startup involves a lot of talking to people usually. But if you can create a useful product that people want to use and you get a bunch of customers and it&#039;s profitable for more than a year or two then you might be able to sell it for a few million depending on size and market etc. I&#039;ve been interested in startups for about 15 years and the hardest part is finding good people to work with. It&#039;s almost impossible. I&#039;ve asked dozens of people I&#039;ve worked with at regular jobs and friends and relatives and other people and maybe 1/40 people is interested in working on things outside of work. Most people aren&#039;t rich because they don&#039;t do anything to try to become rich.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients. This is because patients with undetected infections would be unlikely to be reinfected when testing availability expanded later during our study period. Second, our measure of COVID-19 ending in death within 30-days could also be inaccurate because we did not have access to death certificate data to confirm the actual cause of death. However, many deaths immediately following COVID-19 infection are likely to be at least partially related.<br><br>The availability of vitamin D3 without a prescription also limits our ability to ensure we have fully categorized dosage and supplementation intensity.&quot;<br><br>they bent data, made assumptions and didn&#039;t actually find any significant difference.", "time": 1675236284, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>I looked in the astroturfed zinc and quercitin recommendation to prevent covid.<br>It is all the same.<br>Does nothing and is potentially toxic.", "time": 1675271931, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169874, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>Thoughts on taking 10,000 IU vitamin D daily?

Unable to test for general intelligence, companies turned to a proxy: the university degree. <br>Though not a perfect proxy for intelligence, at the time (1970s) it worked sufficiently well that most companies started adopting it as a job requirement for anything that required brain power. Since the &quot;best jobs&quot; now required a university degree, the government went about making sure that everyone, regardless of intelligence, could get one. This lead to credential inflation as companies increased their requirements for academic degrees while the government made getting such degrees easier and easier.

treatments with certain repeatable effects, etc. though their models were primitive, it does not make them useless when you have a living intellectual and empirical tradition that is refining them. for this reason acupuncture and many other things swayed in popularity in china and the 20th century acupuncture was extinct outside of western alternative medicine, which is where so-called traditional chinese medicine takes it back from. but there&#039;s no guarantee it&#039;s in the same form or used the same way.<br><br>also herbal medicines obviously do things, but they are generally

Well, a satellite is orbitally bound to the Earth, and it&#039;s on a ballistic trajectory. That means that you can fire a satellite from somewhere on Earth and it will orbit the Earth in a regular, predictable path, as it is following the course of gravity.<br><br>A balloon, however, lacks guidance and propulsion. It is not orbitally bound to the Earth, but is supported by its own buoyancy. This makes it extremely difficult to steer and may lack the ability altogether, and is easily influenced by wind. It thus does not follow a predictable ballistic path, and simply drifts wherever it is taken by air currents. It&#039;s very possible for example, that a high-altitude balloon that is intended to travel to a certain destination can be carried by wind currents far off course and even longitudinally around the Earth, as strong wind currents push it in a single direction as a result of the stable rotation of the Earth.

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh.

And such an artists can&#039;t be replaced by an AI for the same reason why software engineer can&#039;t, because such an art has to be specific in order to link to the symbolism it&#039;s trying to convey, and making those specific details would always require someone with real skills. AI could only make their labor simpler in the same way as frameworks do things simpler for programmers.<br>The simulacra-making artists would all be replaced though,and that&#039;s a good thing! All those people who make profit off goyslop content be forced to ponder with philosophical questions.<br>3)It won&#039;t touch most office jobs at all. Many white collar workers just do nothing half the time. Some of those could be automated long ago already, while some were not even necessary there in the first place, they just exist to keep people busy.

It does not search for sentence&#039;s logical continuity nor cohesiveness. It separates words in a sentence and proceeds to segregate them in an array. After that it compares it with a database of words derived from a proposed benchmark paragraph of a high IQ person. The function calculates length of an array, quality of vocabulary used and density, that is a proportion of filler words to rich words. The greater proportion the higher the score and consequently higher IQ.<br>To counteract this argument I may add that there seems to be a bias towards highly technical answers. Anything that includes emotional state or personal insights is scored lower. The first part reaches levels of 145-150. Additional sentences dilute quality, thus to counteract the effect, one must employ only the finest vocabulary. Scored separately, the difference between first and second paragraph is astounding.

It uses a trick invented by old-timey clock makers called Asymmetrical Weights. Essentially, you have two gears connected by a circular chain (like the chain in a bicycle), one gear is held high and the other one is near the ground, and then you hang a weight from the chain. This causes the gears to rotate with a force equal to the weight. Connect the gears to a set of differential gears to multiply rotational speed, and then connect that to a generator to produce electricity.<br><br>Eventually, the weight will reach the ground and the generator will need to be rewound by lifting the weight back up. But this is much easier and much more effortless than it sounds. All you have to do is divide the weight into manageable sizes (e.g., use ten 1-kilogram weights instead of a single 10-kilogram weight) and/or use pulley systems or differential gears to lift it.<br><br>So long as you rewind the generator by hand, you can get as much electricity as you want to for free.", "filename": "ASYMM2", "ext": ".png", "w": 423, "h": 500, "tn_w": 211, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675441469991833, "time": 1675441469, "md5": "13YbfqBmyapRhdlA05G6Kw==", "fsize": 27200, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-build-a-gravitybased-generator-to-get-free", "replies": 11, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 15174972, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Cool story.", "time": 1675442089, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15174994, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)11:46:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a>", "filename": "low", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 323, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1675442772183673, "time": 1675442772, "md5": "E4RquZ9/td9Xc+5tHKi8fA==", "fsize": 19788, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15175047, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)12:13:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a><br>gravity battery", "time": 1675444398, "resto": 15174959}, {"no": 15175168, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:09:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15174959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15174959</a><br>So it&#039;s just a hand crank generator?
