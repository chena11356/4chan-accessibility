This is also not accounting for the various phenotypic and genotypic factors that primatologists often cite as being indicators of paniscus and troglodytes being seperate species without going into much detail including height, weight, skin pigmentation etc. It&#039;s not like this doesn&#039;t exist as an anomaly either, there are countless examples in biology of the requirements for speciation being shockingly few, but chimps and bonobos are the most prominent example since they are our closest extant references, but make no mistake they are not the greatest biological example of this either, such as the fucking countless examples of insects who display the most minor of variation being categorised as a seperate species, but make of that what you will. The point is that within the taxonomic record, and even when applied to great apes, there are an untold amount of precedence to indicate human populations such as SSA and NE are a seperate species, and in actually it&#039;s mostly just SSA that serves as the outlier, plotting the furthest away from any other extant human populations on earth on a PCA. <br><a href=\"#p14994549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14994549</a><br>The examples in the OP are bone clones, industry standard in terms of osteological and paleoanthropological representations.

The second edition of that treatise was later published with that 80% revision done by Maxwell himself under strong pressure, and with a guest editor.

Competition for survival among entities derived from human beings (whether man-machine hybrids, purely artificial entities evolved from such hybrids, or human minds uploaded into machines), as well as competition between human-derived entities and those machines or other entities that are not derived from human beings, will lead to the elimination of all but some minute percentage of all the entities involved. This has nothing to do with any specific traits of human beings or of their machines; it is a general principle of evolution through natural selection.

It&#039;d make it more or less likely for the transition to happen, but once that transition happens the amount of time that passes would be the same for both. Idk if this has been experimentally verified, this is just based on what I know, and I&#039;m happy to be proven wrong so lemme know if you find anything.<br><br>You&#039;re right that the strength of gravity and velocity relative to the speed of light would cause a difference, but the definition of 1 second would remain the same. It&#039;s just that 1 second can vary from one place to another. Usually by a very miniscule amount, so little that being in orbit for years only leads to a difference of microseconds, but 1 second orbiting a black hole would be significantly longer compared to 1 second on earth. How significant would depend on how big the black hole is, and how close you&#039;re orbiting. As far as we know, a living creature would still only experience 1 second no matter what, but if you&#039;re orbiting a black hole then 1 second for you could be equal to hours, days, even months on earth. <br><br>TL;DR Watch Interstellar", "time": 1668884771, "resto": 14997950}, {"no": 14999311, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)14:09:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14999245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14999245</a><br>ct is the vector that results from adding vt.
