Genuinely the smartest person I&#039;ve ever met, he was the &#039;crazy&#039; type of smart. He wrote a paper in the 70s while he was a graduate student that expanded on early Gauge Theory. His advisors and all the other academics refused to accept his results. 40 years later, he finally got recognition for his accomplishments because two ivy-league professors published the same results he had done 4 decades earlier. His work is now taught at Princeton and in several textbooks. His name is Kuo\u2010Ho (Tom) Yang, I always found it weird when people from Asia take an American name but I guess I understand, it would get annoying fast to have mid-westerners constantly fucking up your name. There isn&#039;t a picture of him anywhere on the internet. He was the greatest teacher I&#039;ve ever had. After class and labs, he would just sit and talk to you for hours about anything if you wanted. Always enthusiastic about the topic being discussed. He would tell you stories from his life, like how as a kid, he used to dig through the Taiwanese military&#039;s trash to find thrown away radios and other tech to salvage components for circuits he was making. I found his landmark paper a while back, but can&#039;t seem to find it atm cause Google is shit now, here are some of his published works: https://aip.scitation.org/topic/aip<wbr>thesaurus/p3437p87479?pageSize=100&amp;<wbr>startPage=&amp;ContribAuthorRaw=Hirschf<wbr>elder%2C%20Joseph%20O <br>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/1<wbr>0.1063/1.442295<br>He has a bunch more, that is just through that one publication. I doubt 99% of students get the chance to have a teacher like him, I am lucky. It was like having one of the top Ivy-league professors teach your freshman dynamics 2 course in a class of 17 people.

You&#039;re really learning two things at once, how the mathematics works, and what all the symbols mean. Learning languages, especially symbolic languages instead of phonetic languages, is not easy. And retaining that language also isn&#039;t very easy unless if you think about it often. The gov lists languages by difficulty here that they use for training people and the symbolic languages take four times longer than languages like Italian or Spanish<br> https://www.state.gov/foreign-langu<wbr>age-training<br>So before you can really learn the underlying concepts you have to learn and remember the symbols. But why? Isn&#039;t it the concepts that are the important part of math? And for people that don&#039;t use math very often then they have all these symbols they need to either remember or look up every time they want to read any math. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything saying they&#039;re must only be one mathematical language either. What&#039;s being proposed is a simpler language for people that aren&#039;t professional mathematicians so they can get involved in math easier.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented.

If a retard finds a particular class difficult, then he should perhaps not take other difficult classes in tandem with it, focus more, take courses of an easier difficulty.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

There was no epsilon delta stuff, but this lead to a lot of ambiguity on stuff such as what continuous functions are. Like the function which is 1 in rational points, but 0 in irrational points seems continuous. No matter how much you zoom in, there are no breaks in the graph of the function, however the epsilon-delta definition shows without ambiguity that it is not continuous.

Since there is in the whole universe neither an intelligent force nor an eternal force (mankind, for all its yearnings, has yet to succeed in inventing a perpetual motion machine), we must assume that this force that is active within the atom comes from a conscious and intelligent mind.

I assume this rank is reserved for the descendants of David, or something like that, which genetically excludes the people that run DB from ever taking control of the Knights of Malta. Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

I would like evidence that links specific brain cells to the creation of a specific thought or concept in a way that can be repeatedly demonstrated and for added bonus point, show how a completely different set of brain cells in two different people&#039;s heads can produce the same concept in two different minds to where we can know what one another are talking about, namely infinity in this case. Or, cut to the chase and tell me how a piece of objectively observable meat beams a non-objectively observable subjective experience into an observer. And explain why consciousness, if it is a physical object, can not be objectively observed as all other physical objects can be? What is the mechanism whereby this piece of meat actually transmits this non-material concept of infinity or any other concept to the experiencer?<br>point being pic related. Consciousness is not physical. Consciousness is made of consciousness, not brain or matter. Consciousness IS, because of a high level of immersion in the physical (virtual) world, constrained in certain ways by physicality that that can be observed and experienced neural correlatively, but that shouldn&#039;t be mistaken for consciousness being made of matter or it being a physical substance. So the number of cells in a physical (virtual) brain is irrelevant to what a mind can conceive of. In point of fact, brains, as is all other matter, are only ever observed as MENTAL OBJECTS in minds. And this by the way is why infinities are grounded in minds, not in the physical world. No infinities in the physical world, no continuities, no analyticity. These things reside only in models that can be mapped on to the physical world in some cases to make predictions to non-arbitrary precision.", "filename": "quote-consciousness-cannot-be-accounted-for-in-physical-terms-for-consciousness-is-absolutely-erwin-schrodinger-42-81-39", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1670788615477878, "time": 1670788615, "md5": "WafHWTVf+e4jdf9IL6/ceg==", "fsize": 82760, "resto": 15043504}, {"no": 15046248, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:06:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15046215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15046215</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Define digit</span><br>Hindu-arabic numeral", "time": 1670789193, "resto": 15043504}, {"no": 15046249, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:06:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15046248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15046248</a><br>Why can&#039;t I write numbers using Roman numerals?", "time": 1670789218, "resto": 15043504}, {"no": 15046315, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:29:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15046190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15046190</a><br>Exactly my point.<br>Finitists wouldn&#039;t talk about the cardinality of the integers since they disagree with &quot;the integers&quot; being a set in the first place.", "time": 1670790583, "resto": 15043504}, {"no": 15046365, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)15:43:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15045341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15045341</a><br>There isn&#039;t one.

But you might as well ask what causes people to burn out of their jobs. PhDs vary hugely between countries, fields, groups and individual supervisors. Some PIs literally do not give a fuck if you don&#039;t do anything for a year, others micromanage every hour of your day. Both can be stressful. Personally, the workload wasn&#039;t that bad; at the end of the day, the bar for getting a PhD is pretty low. However, there is a far greater amount of things that you could/should be doing if you actually want to stand out among competition, to the extent that doing it all is simply not possible. There&#039;s publications, conferences, networking, teaching, outreach, research, getting funding, applying for positions, keeping up with literature, learning new shit, list goes on. And of course your work is made public and your output measured by metrics seen by anyone. So there&#039;s always something you should be doing that&#039;s knocking at the back of your head, and you&#039;re constantly comparing yourself to countless peers many of whom are just better.

The number six million, specifically, was showing up in numerous newspapers prior to WW2, back to around 1900, in articles and donation advertisements talking about the many starving semites in Eastern Europe and things of that nature. We&#039;re not talking two or three examples, but dozens of them across a variety of papers.

What has been a phenomenon however, is that high intelligence posters frequently crossboard, including activity on /pol/. We saw a heightened effort posting spectacle during Covid 19 where many autistic and gifted individuals were sharing their pertinent information anecdotal or referential to them at the time. From physicists to geneticists to engineers of all kinds, /pol/ saw major action from people deeply intertwined in the vaccination process or intimate knowledge of biology, mathematics, and general stem/med. It stands to reason from this activity that there was a validity to browse /pol/ to find new arguments being made on whether one should take a vaccine or refuse it, and how to protect one\u2019s self from Covid since the rest of the Internet implemented intense, authoritarian slave control of what could be posted by their users, bans were handed out like candy by anyone who was interested in real discussion. <br><br>Conclusion: /pol/ has a use case just like /sci/, that in when major happenings occur in the world, some intelligent people do find their ways to certain nefarious areas of the internet, and it is useful to engage or lurk for their opinions, even if it means wading through troughs of pure unfiltered shit.

Then you ask the nurse for your batch number of the vaccine. Then you write to the pharmaceutical company and they will mail you a copy of the ingredients. It has to be done this way because EVERY VACCINE HAS DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!!<br><br>This got me thinking. If every single batch is different, then isn&#039;t that in effect human experimentation? I hate to sound alarmist, but in the most technical sense of the phrase &quot;human experimentation&quot; if every vaccine is slightly different then it&#039;s be criminal to NOT record the results of each batch of the vaccine and compare them to other batches. THIS is how they skipped all the vaccine trials and testing. They skipped straight to human experimentation phase as soon as possible, and now that we&#039;re here, they can&#039;t go back.

When we are taking the n dimensional Hausdorff measure in n-dimensional Euclidean space, it equals the Lebesgue measure, so for the time you can think of it as an &quot;extended&quot; Lebesgue measure. For now, let me show you an example of using the coarea formula. <br><br>Suppose we are working over [math]\\mathbb{R}^3[/math]. Here, we&#039;ll let [math]g \\equiv 1[/math] and [math]u:(x, y, z) \\mapsto z[/math] be the projection onto the z-axis. The goal is to compute the volume of the cone [math]\\Omega[/math] of height h and base radius R, based at the origin, and vertical axis being the z-axis. Therefore, the expression [eqn]\\int_\\Omega g(x) |\\nabla u(x)| dx = \\int_\\Omega dx[/eqn] is going to lend for us the volume of this cone. The coarea formula allows us to rewrite this integral in terms of the level sets of u. For any [math]t \\in \\mathbb{R}[/math], the set [math]u^{-1}(t)[/math] is precisely the disk given at a height of t up the cone. The radius of this disk is given by [eqn]r_t = \\frac{R(h - t)}{h}[/eqn] Then, the inner integral is simply going to produce the area of such a disk, and the integral over R will be replaced with the integral from 0 to the height of the cone.
