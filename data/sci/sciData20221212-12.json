For example, you have a very long dirt road, and a very large bag of rocks, and a very large book of the machine&#039;s states. You draw the gridded tape in the dirt with your finger along the road, and place rocks down in the grid squares to represent ones, and no rock for zeroes. After a very long time you place all your rocks down to initialise your AI program, then you begin to compute the program (very slowly) as if you were the Turing machine. Is the AI still conscious now? It&#039;s still being computed in the same way as if it were on advanced hardware, but when put this way it seems absurd that a system of lines on the dirt and rocks could be conscious.

Still, I&#039;m pretty sure the claim is correct.<br>Consider a digraph [math]G[/math] with at most [math]dim(V)[/math] vtxs. In particular, for your two fixed vectors [math]v_1,v_2[/math], label the vtxs [math]T^\\ell v_1[/math] for [math]\\ell\\geq0[/math], similar for [math]v_2[/math]. These labels may overlap on some vtxs.

If these are non-overlapping, your intersection is [math]\\{0\\}[/math]. If they _do_ intersect, they must do so in some maximal vtx [math]x[/math], where maximality should be taken wrt chain length starting in [math]x[/math] and stopping in _the_ terminal vtx.

Like turning out the lights in a room, they subtracted the light from stars, galaxies, planets and the zodiacal light. Surprisingly, a ghostly, feeble glow was left over. It&#039;s equivalent to the steady light of ten fireflies spread across the entire sky. One possible explanation is that a shell of dust envelops our solar system all the way out to Pluto, and is reflecting sunlight. Seeing airborne dust caught in sunbeams is no surprise when cleaning the house. But this must have a more exotic origin. Because the glow is so smoothy distributed, the likely source is innumerable comets\u00e2&quot;free-flying dusty snowballs of ice. They fall in toward the sun from all different directions, spewing out an exhaust of dust as the ices sublimate due to heat from the sun. If real, this would be a newly discovered architectural element of the solar system. It has remained invisible until very imaginative and curious astronomers, and the power of Hubble, came along.
