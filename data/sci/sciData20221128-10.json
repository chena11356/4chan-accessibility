Convinced a lot of second-rate investors by having powerful people on the board and perfecting a &quot;female tech genius&quot; act (she would learn a lot of details about Steve Jobs and similar entrepreneurs in order to imitate them closely). What her company actually did was just run regular blood testing machines way under spec on diluted blood. This means that many patients making serious medical decisions got inaccurate test results. She managed to keep this under wraps for a few years by maintaining a culture of secrecy and paranoia where she was the only person who had the full picture, and by threatening people who asked questions with firing and lawsuits. Her company&#039;s lead scientist even committed suicide from the stress.<br>The fraud was eventually exposed in a series of articles by a WSJ journalist. Holmes was convicted and sentenced to 11 years on charges of defrauding investors. (A lot of reddit-brained people interpreted this as a sign that only investors matter in the US, but in reality it&#039;s a quirk of US law that makes it easier to prosecute fraudulent companies from the investor side than the client side. If you want to know more, search Matt Levine&#039;s writings for &quot;everything is securities fraud&quot;.)<br>During the trial, she played a poor innocent woman who didn&#039;t know anything and was just being manipulated by evil men. She also got pregnant 2 times to delay going to prison. Honestly, I think she deserves more than 11 years because she&#039;s completely unrepentant and a master manipulator.

The Pyramid itself is a Golden Pyramid (a lot of gold going around I know just try to keep up). It is called this because the triangles that make up this pyramid express the golden ratio (Fibonacci sequence) meaning that the hypotenuse is Phi (1.618). If you divide the perimeter of the pyramid (921.316m) by its height (146.7m) you get 6.28 which is two pi (2\u03c0). It is thought that the Pythagorean Hippasus discovered The Golden Ratio. It is so strange for this structure to be built with these patterns and accuracy; things like 2\u03c0 rads/sec are equal to 1 Hertz: used in frequency and electricity. Where did this math come from: are we just seeing things that aren\u2019t there?<br><br>The golden ratio is an irrational number: meaning it is neither a whole number or a fraction. This shocked many fellow Pythagoreans. Like Pi it is a never ending infinite number which expresses and defines perfect curvature and proportion. This all starts to become very reminiscent of Greg Cantors work which famously coined the term \u201csome infinites are bigger than others\u201d (A W Moore; Nigel Warburton - AEON). While the understanding of Cantors\u2019 theorem (of which his work drove him insane) was far beyond the understanding of the Greek scholars: they no doubt were struggling with similar concepts. How big are these infinite numbers: how can we define them, and do they overlap in the inner workings of reality?<br><br>1", "filename": "triangles", "ext": ".png", "w": 1050, "h": 754, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 179, "tim": 1669516894351792, "time": 1669516894, "md5": "jlKVD4VCfudvZ41eVb6g4g==", "fsize": 797711, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-great-pyramid-of-giza-is-called-a-golden", "replies": 21, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 16, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 15016429, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)15:08:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15015353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15015353</a><br> [math]\\sqrt(5)[/math] is an irrational, sums and fractions of an irrational with a rational always is a irrational...", "time": 1669579685, "resto": 15015179}, {"no": 15016442, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)15:14:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15015193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15015193</a><br>&quot;art&quot; doesn&#039;t exist anon, you&#039;re using a made up concept to indicate that someone did a good job designing and creating something to be beautiful", "time": 1669580083, "resto": 15015179}, {"no": 15017574, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)00:57:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15016429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15016429</a><br>you said<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;irrational means it is not a fraction</span><br>which is wrong and indicates you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re on about", "time": 1669615036, "resto": 15015179}, {"no": 15017594, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)01:21:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15016442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15016442</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beautiful</span><br>Doesnt exist.
