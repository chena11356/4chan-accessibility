Continuous data is any data which can be measured with infinite accuracy (or modelled as such), hence the theory of continuous distributions can be applied to it.

Easy. The atmospheric-electric records prove that electromagnetic force is exerted on our atoms and molecules, at a strength we cannot overrule, and the amount of strength varies by atom/molecule, leading to some elements being &#039;heavier&#039; (or pulled more strongly in the observable range for the environment) than others and sinking in the &quot;Earth oxygen/nitrogen/etc breathable atmospheric area&quot; and in other environmental areas/conditions. The records prove that non-detectable matter doesn&#039;t exist, and &#039;anomalies&#039; are stimulated through illegal electronic devices and their associated activity. We live on a giant electromagnet, and every single component (atoms, electrons, molecules, etc) of our local environment (the breathable atmosphere) has bioelectromagnetic components.

I keep seeing people on /g/ claiming that programmers will all lose their jobs soon because of things like github copilot, they say within the next few years. Copilot is pretty much a more advanced search engine, it can stick a few small bits of code together but sometimes it just gives you results copied verbatim out of peoples public repos that it trained on. Wix has had an AI website builder for about 7 years now and most devs don&#039;t even know it exists, because no-one uses it, because it can only do really basic websites like Bob&#039;s Plumbing Services small business thing with just basic text and images and maybe a few basic forms. If you were to write that website in the form of a single configuration file where you could change the various parts it would probably be a few hundred lines at most, maybe even less than 100. If you were to take an established SaaS website or a video game or some medium size domain specific desktop software then a single configuration file describing it could be hundreds of thousands of lines. Essentially the number of variables increases exponentially with the complexity. As the end user of an AI you&#039;re expected to be the one providing values for at least some of these variables and the more you provide the closer the result will be to what you want, otherwise the AI is basically just guessing what you want.
