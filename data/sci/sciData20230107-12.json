You don&#039;t even need to have a gf, just having a good relationship with your family and some friends can do wonders. <br>Sometimes we put unreasonable requests upon ourselves, I know because I&#039;ve been there.

There are several ways to treat myopia, including the following:<br><br>Eyeglasses: Eyeglasses are a common and effective treatment for myopia. They correct vision by bending light rays to focus on the retina, allowing you to see clearly.<br><br>Contact lenses: Contact lenses work in the same way as eyeglasses, but they are worn directly on the surface of the eye. They are a good alternative to eyeglasses for some people.<br><br>Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery, such as LASIK, can correct myopia by reshaping the cornea to allow light rays to focus properly on the retina. This can be a permanent solution to myopia, but it is important to note that it is not without risks.<br><br>Orthokeratology: Orthokeratology, also known as &quot;ortho-k,&quot; is a non-surgical treatment that uses special contact lenses to temporarily reshape the cornea and correct myopia. The lenses are typically worn overnight and removed during the day.<br><br>Vision therapy: Vision therapy is a type of treatment that aims to improve visual skills and eye coordination.

He covers superficial everything you need to know to start with QM, you wont understand much about QM with that book. Why? Because he goes the Schroedinger Wavemechanics approach but doesn&#039;t go deep into it. Speaking of which, there are several different approaches of Quamntum mechanics, or lets say, formalism you could follow. The most known is the Wavemechanics by Schroedinger, the second is the Heisenbergian Matrixmechanics, the third is less of a formalism but involves Functional Analysis and therefore a bit of Matrix mechanics and its more of Mathematical Physics. One significant approach are Path Integrals by Feynman, also you shouldn&#039;t avoid Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, but i guess thats something that comes last. As for QM Books, have a quick List: &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Dirac. &quot;Matrix mechanics&quot; by H.S. Green (He was a student of Max Born), &quot;Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral Point of View&quot; by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe. &quot;Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals&quot; by Richard Feynman. Also Lev Landaus &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; out of his &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; though, there is a newer one which fused with the Quantumelectrodynamic book so beware, keep your eyes open for the older one. Also if you are in the mood i totally recommend the Feynman lectures which also include a book on QM. All of those books are very basic and teach you the various different approaches and formalisms. What i can&#039;t recommend, but will include is W. Paulis &quot;Wellenmechanik&quot; and Schroedingers &quot;Abhandlungen zur Wellenmechanik&quot;, &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Von Neumann. There are probably a few more, don&#039;t know, i am not at home, and those i don&#039;t recommend are gems but only useful if you know german and if you get your hands on them, but they are all rather Mathematical PHysics books so they&#039;ll teach the math behind.

Yes they are used in encryption, but there are other methods of encryption that don&#039;t use primes and are arguably better like lattice based methods and other post quantum methods. But primes aren&#039;t used in encryption because primes are great, they&#039;re used because mathematicians are too retarded to work out a way to factor them efficiently. People are actually paid money to research prime numbers all day, it&#039;s laughable. Sure maybe have one or two guys looking into them but instead there&#039;s dozens or even hundreds of them and they treat primes as some kind of miracle of mathematics and they must all be found like they&#039;re Pokemon or some shit. I liken it to say a video game speedrunner looking for all the glitches in a game. People that follow the speedrunning scene of that game think the top runner is some kind of genius pushing extreme boundaries and blowing minds by discovering things never thought possible. In reality outside their tiny group nobody gives a fuck and think they&#039;re idiots for wasting their time because nothing that comes out of the group is useful or meaningful in any way other than to their own little group. But for mathematics the amazing genius aspect has leaked out into the public and there&#039;s a notion that these people searching for something useless are of the highest order of intelligence.

I don&#039;t feel the vertigo anymore, but I suspect my brain just adapted to it, because I still I get carsickness (never had that problem before the shot). I can do muscle training and play Beat Saber.

If you choose black you would have won. If you choose red you would have lost and you would have messaged yourself from the future to not choose red. Which means you would end up choosing black. But then where did the message to not choose red come from? If you choose black to start off with you&#039;d have no reason to send a message back to yourself. If you actually built a time mirror and sent messages back to yourself which changed your future that would lead to a paradox, so what actually happens is you just some how, as if by magic develop perfect luck. Every decision you make is the optimal one to prohibit your cause to even send a message to the past. If something bad did happen to you you&#039;d try to prevent it leading to a paradox so any avoidable misfortune would be automatically avoided by you almost as if you perfect intuition.<br><br><br>https://youtu.be/Qd77OXWC1eg", "time": 1672938435, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102039, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:30:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102009</a><br>Reminds me of the thing on /X/ with quantum immortality, obviously not the same but the way reality bends to make it happen as it would have to play out that way to not fuck reality up", "time": 1672939856, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102041, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101798</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atoms exist only in once place and time at a time</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Time is our movement through another spacial dimension</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are not both in the past and in the present at the same time</span><br>source?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can go really fast and &quot;catch up&quot; with the current present atoms in the future but the atoms are not yet in the future</span><br>source?", "time": 1672939992, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102062, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:59:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15102041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15102041</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;You can go really fast and &quot;catch up&quot; with the current present atoms in the future but the atoms are not yet in the future</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;source?</span><br>time dilation bro, ,relativity 101", "time": 1672941575, "resto": 15101798}, {"no": 15102065, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101798</a><br>Many worlds theory says otherwise.

When 4chan was smaller and the internet more a place to escape reality, this place excelled in being a cultural powerhouse for the internet\u2019s younger years due to it\u2019s relaxed rules. Although this place has been notorious for its degeneracy since its conception, the freedom, anonymity, and ease of use allowed people to be creative and spread ideas and memes. Before people figured out how to monetize and push agendas on the internet, it was mainly ran by people who just wanted to make things for the sake of making things. I wouldn\u2019t say the modern state of 4chan, and the internet as a whole, changed over night but the tipping point between the esoterical, nerdy environment and the mass audience, low quality spamming occurred around 2016 with the election. Although there were signs of the internet being used to polarize and manipulate groups, the 2016 election truly showed everyone how effective the internet was at sowing discontent and pushing propaganda. 4chan, emphasising freedom of speech, attracted a lot of unhinged folks. People who\u2019d take advantage and ruin everything. For every Average Joe, there\u2019s a malicious Alex who forces everyone to look over their shoulder. I like to think that most people here aren\u2019t malicious or trying to push their stupid agendas on some science board, yet the bad faith posters are much more vocal and beacon themselves to attract other unhinged individuals. It\u2019s the paradox of tolerance. If you\u2019re tolerant of everyone, you\u2019ll eventually get shitheads that ruin it for everyone else. It\u2019s why I support gatekeeping and moderation to an extent. You have to filter the folks who\u2019ll just post low quality or de-rail a discussion for their own personal agendas.

However even in rich nations consultants seem to be generally detrimental.

It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

The Simoa antigen assays for spike, S1, and nucleocapsid were previously validated in plasma from pre-pandemic healthy subjects, pre-pandemic patients with respiratory infections, COVID-19 negative patients, and COVID-19 positive patients [7]. Authors detected S1 and N in 64% of COVID-19 positive patients, and S1 levels were significantly associated with disease severity. Here antigens S1 and spike were measured to probe mRNA translation, whereas nucleocapsid antigen served as a negative control (Figures 1A, B, C, Supplementary Table 5). After the first 100-\u00b5g dose, the mRNA-1273 vaccine produced detectable levels of S1 antigen in plasma in 11 participants, and spike antigen was detected in 3 of 13 participants.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

Other animals use it to establish and maintain pecking orders and breeding rights. Since humans are mostly free from natural selection, we&#039;re mostly affected by sexual and artificial selection. The being the case, it&#039;s reasonable that a mechanism of behavior so widely observed in nature, is still practiced despite our increased intelligence, and our ability to contemplate morality.<br><br>In order to better understand this behavior, I think it&#039;s best to start by establishing that geography has a significant impact on culture. I.e, a group of people settle in an area, determine what the most comfortable existence they can establish is, and then create a culture that justifies that existence, while demonizing detracting behaviors, and encouraging behavior that supports the aforementioned culture. <br><br>How does bullying factor into all this? While no one likes the idea of being bullied, harassed, etc, we all enjoy upward social mobility, or at the very least, stability in regards to our current social position. By degrading others, especially in social settings such as school, a bully is able to publically announce their social standing, as at the very least, being above that of the person they are harassing. Most people never do anything to prevent the bullying of another, because that action introduces the opportunity for downward social mobility, with little in the way of possible rewards. Although we all like to believe we would do something heroic when we see wrongdoing, most psychological and sociological evidence points to the contrary.", "time": 1672994375, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103398, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br>It is also unsurprising that most bullies tend to not be extremely successful, and the most victims suffer longterm negative consequences. The type of person attracted to bullying will typically be a person that cannot establish a high social standing with physical ability or intelligence, so by demeaning others, especially those with traits they lack, they are able to create a level of social standing (albeit temporarily) usually unobtainable to them. Regarding the victims of bullying, this attitude of &quot;it toughens you up&quot;, is just ridiculous. While we can always expect negative social interactions to be a part of our experience as a social species, being harassed and abused is not to be expected, as it is maladaptive behavior. <br><br>I think it&#039;s also important to make a distinction between bullying that exists to elevate the social standing of the abuser, and the natural &quot;demonization&quot; of behavior that is seen as culturally inappropriate. As I mentioned before, all cultures seek to encourage some behavior and prevent others, and to the end, social settings have an unspoken code of conduct which is to be followed, or one will face social consequences. And these consequences tend to be focused on ostracization, instead of intentional physical or psychological abuse. As an example, if you were at store, and a person walked in dressed as an actual clown, most people would be uncomfortable around them, and treat them differently as a result, since they&#039;re violating social norms. This type of bullying is useful for society, as it promotes social cohesion, a sense of normalcy, and shared values, whereas the aforementioned type of bullying, has not postive consequences", "time": 1672995147, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103504, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)05:15:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15103387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103387</a><br><a href=\"#p15103398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15103398</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t subscribe to your theory if you were GROWING ON MY ASS", "filename": "kevin&#039;s brother", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 306, "h": 393, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673000100981416, "time": 1673000100, "md5": "yCDf5xi4xAJ2xnKwZkXwUg==", "fsize": 25954, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15103610, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)07:03:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15100888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15100888</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think about this study</span><br>Psychology isn&#039;t science", "time": 1673006593, "resto": 15100888}, {"no": 15105050, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)19:28:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15101464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15101464</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s a bit extreme, don&#039;t you think?</span><br>I thought it was letting the dude off easy.

It&#039;s for a variety of reasons: either people with an entry level understanding of the topic wanting to be spoonfed, making posts and threads that are loosely tangential, and those who just want to be a contrarian and complain. /sci/ specifically is filled with people who want to be spoonfed things that they should have learned in highschool, ask about things that belong on other boards ( just look at how frequently /r9k/ or /wsr/ threads pop up in the catalog), or whinge about &quot;science&quot; when they&#039;re not even talking about scientists or any particular piece of research, but rather what bureaucrats and the the news or what popular media are saying. Ironically the people who whine the loudest about the IFLS crowd have as little scientific understanding as they do.

To be specific, this means the natural state for quantum particles is a superposition of all possibilities. Mathematically, we represent an unmeasured particle as a superposition function which shows us the probability of a particle being measured with any given value of any given property. This means we have a graph of x, y, and probability all plotted on their own axis (or you may say, as their own dimension!).<br>I want you to now imagine the probability function as an actual property of the particle, like mass or charge, or x-position. When we measure the particle&#039;s momentum, and &#039;collapse this wave function&#039;, mathematically we are performing a Fourier transform on the probability (or wave) function. This means we are taking information about a function and projecting it into another dimension. In normal math, this would be the frequency dimension, but in quantum mechanics we transform the wave into a new function in &#039;momentum space&#039;! The Copenhagen interpretation says we have fundamentally altered this particle by transforming the wave function.<br><br>Now that a particle was measured, and the wave function collapsed: we can perform experiments with this particle and predict the outcome 100% of the time. We have altered the state of the particle by measuring it; no longer is a superposition.<br><br>An entangled pair means (mathematically) that we can describe both particles with a single wave function; imagine two sine waves, summed. Therefore, by measuring one particle, you have actually measured both and (spooky action:) collapsed both wave functions! You have influenced the entangled counterpart as if the information traveled faster than light - telling the distant particle to now exist with a collapsed wave function.<br>However, information itself is still capped at c.", "time": 1673059615, "resto": 15103947}, {"no": 15105314, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:55:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15104677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15104677</a><br><a href=\"#p15105305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15105305</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, information itself is still capped at c.</span><br>I just want to clarify:<br>Here I am saying you now know something about that very distant particle, so what can you do?<br>Well nothing. <br>Sure, you know something about it, but the only way to act on that knowledge is to convey information about the particle to the location that other particle exists at.

The material was interesting in general and I learned about one thing in there that I think about to this day: the social construction of reality. It&#039;s a sociological principle that says for practical purposes &quot;reality&quot; is determined more strongly by people&#039;s opinions on what is real than by what is actually real.

For example, the rhinovirus doesn&#039;t do well at warmer temperatures, so it tends to stay in the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 is better at infecting the lungs, but even then, I provided a study where only 64% of the infected had detectable viral particles in their blood, and this was using severe patients (mild cases appear to have a much lower rate, but that&#039;s from another study). The vaccinated, however, had detectable S1 sub unit in 84% of people.

They don&#039;t care that GMO farming destroys the land because it&#039;s heckin Science\u2122 (even though it&#039;s all about monopolization of the food supply and making food resilient to toxic pesticides and herbicides which you then eat). Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?
