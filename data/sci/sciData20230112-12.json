How has such a thing been possible, how is it still possible? For it is necessary to insist upon this extraordinary but undeniable fact: experimental science has progressed thanks in great part to the work of men astoundingly mediocre, and even less than mediocre. That is to say, modern science, the root and symbol of our actual civilization, finds a place for-the intellectually commonplace man and allows him to work therein with success. The reason of this lies in what is at the same time the great advantage and the gravest peril of the new science, and of the civilization directed and represented by it, namely, mechanization.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[\u2026] previously, men could be divided simply into the learned and the ignorant, those more or less the one, and those more or less the other.

The Simoa antigen assays for spike, S1, and nucleocapsid were previously validated in plasma from pre-pandemic healthy subjects, pre-pandemic patients with respiratory infections, COVID-19 negative patients, and COVID-19 positive patients [7]. Authors detected S1 and N in 64% of COVID-19 positive patients, and S1 levels were significantly associated with disease severity. Here antigens S1 and spike were measured to probe mRNA translation, whereas nucleocapsid antigen served as a negative control (Figures 1A, B, C, Supplementary Table 5). After the first 100-\u00b5g dose, the mRNA-1273 vaccine produced detectable levels of S1 antigen in plasma in 11 participants, and spike antigen was detected in 3 of 13 participants.

But scientists consider body awareness to be a building block of self-awareness. An organism needs to understand how their body moves through the world before they can develop a sense of self. So, the scientists wanted to know if dogs possess that fundamental cognitive ability.<br><br>They adapted a \u201cbody as obstacle\u201d test that was first conducted with human infants then later with elephants. The task was simple \u2013 the dogs had to pass a toy to their owner. The toy was sitting on a mat and so were the dogs. The tricky part was that sometimes the toy was attached to the mat, so the dogs\u2019 own bodies prevented them from lifting the toy high enough to hand it over. To pass the test, the dogs had to get off the mat first to free the toy from their weight then deliver the toy (with the mat attached) to their owner.<br><br>If dogs have body awareness, they will step off the mat. If they stay on the mat and continue to try to lift the toy or simply give up, they don\u2019t understand their own contribution to the problem. It seems simple, but although elephants pass a similar test, human infants who are younger than 18-24 months of age don\u2019t.

This is due to the very, very small angular size of typical stars. Based on fits to typical Gaia stars above 10th mag, (down to 100 times fainter than can be seen by eye) a typical star has an apparent radius of 0.5 milliarcseconds. That is tiny, it&#039;s the apparent size of a 1 meter object on the surface of the Moon as seen from Earth. And so satellites have to exactly pass over these tiny targets to cause a transit. Down to this apparent brightness of stars there are about 2.5 million stars, the collective fraction of the sky covered is only about 4 trillionths. You see the issue. If you assume the satellite is in a 100 min orbit then you only get a transit every ~160 orbits. That&#039;s assuming you observe all stars simultaneously, constantly. The actual transit will also only last microseconds, so you need to do all of this at ridiculous frame rates. With such a low rate tracing orbits to find out which object is which will be almost impossible. It&#039;s just not sensible, it is orders of magnitude easier just to observe them directly or with radar.<br><br><a href=\"#p15116906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15116906</a><br>Proxima is very difficult for imaging, because it&#039;s a red dwarf the habitable zone is very close.

To identify optimal geometries, we developed a theoretical expression for the lift force based on both Stokes (low-Re) and momentum (high-Re) theory and validated it using finite-element fluid-dynamics simulations. We then systematically varied geometric parameters, including Knudsen pump porosity, to minimize the operating altitude or maximize the payload. Assuming that the large vehicles can be made from previously demonstrated nanocardboard material, the minimum altitude is 55 km while the payload can reach 1 kilogram for 3D structures with 10-meter diameter at 80 km altitude. In all cases, the maximum areal density of the sidewalls cannot exceed a few grams per square meter, demonstrating the need for ultralight porous materials.</span><br>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04281", "time": 1673525906, "resto": 15116218}, {"no": 15118239, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:19:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15118209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15118209</a><br>we are in a unique time just after humanity is effectively united by modern communications tech and before we spread out enough to become disorganized again, a unique opportunity to influence the future of all of humanity", "time": 1673525952, "resto": 15116218}, {"no": 15118250, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15118239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15118239</a><br>globohomo phase", "time": 1673526327, "resto": 15116218}, {"no": 15118259, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:29:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15118250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15118250</a><br>God bless the speed of light, the universe is truly well made", "time": 1673526547, "resto": 15116218}, {"no": 15118276, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:37:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15116959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15116959</a><br>The bible doesn&#039;t say aliens don&#039;t exist.

I study Computational Maidposting. Last time I posted my research here it was Wolfy MaidSearch and I got all boards banned for three days and my post got jannied off Warosu. I think this happened because a zoomer janny didn&#039;t know what a REPL is.<br><br>Today I have a useful application of Computational Maidposting in a new Computer Experiment called Kurumi MaidCard. Kurumi MaidCard is a Computer Program which can store compressed text in a Maid Address, and read that text back out of the Maid Address. I named it after Kurumi the vampire maid from Touhou because she came in my threads and helped me with math a lot of times and told me books. Thank you Kurumi, for telling me math ideas.<br><br>To get Kurumi MaidCard you need Java 18. Then you need to save MiniMaid.java (case sensitive).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get MiniMaid</span><br>https://pastebin.com/6ChEa6xS<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get Kurumi MaidCard</span><br>Save the attached image in the same directory you put MiniMaid in, then open a terminal and type<br><br>java MiniMaid.java file.png<br><br>with &quot;file.png&quot; replaced with whatever you saved the Maid Card as. MiniMaid will extract the full version of Kurumi MaidCard, along with the README, assuming that 4Chan doesn&#039;t mess with the pixels of images uploaded to it. The README explains Maid-LZW and how to use the Kurumi MaidCard REPL to make your own Maid Cards.<br><br>I plan to use Kurumi MaidCard to distribute all my Computer Experiments. The next one will be the Ilulu Number Calculator/SLAM. This should break my dependence on Pastebin, and let me distribute multi-file Computer Programs so the architecture can be saner and nicer without using GitHub.

The awareness itself is not a algo and non-physical and not a creation of computation. The CONTENT of the of the consciousness, ie the physical datastream that the freewill awareness unit (consciousness) interfaces with is a computed/informational/numerical/vi<wbr>rtual reality. It&#039;s a computed reality that includes consciousness as an input device I might add. So it&#039;s not a situation of pre-determination on what will happen. Though the majority of macro objects with relative low uncertainty such as planets&#039; orbits are EFFECTIVELY (from the view point of the observer) deterministic. It&#039;s an probabilistically evolving simulation from initial conditions of data objects (matter) and rules on how they interact (physics &#039;laws&#039;). And, by the way, the system can be updated between planck refresh rate. To the renderer, the &#039;time&#039; between refresh is not physical. This is why you can mimic some of the content of consciousness, but never create it, ie, never create a a free will awareness unit. The only way computers might ever be conscious is if a free will awareness unit is either assigned to a non-bio-computer to use as an avatar, or a freewill awareness unit CHOOSES to use one. OR, there might be a constraint that says there can only be bio/metabolizing avatars. We (those of of consciousnesses immersed in the system of physicality) don&#039;t remember pre-existence and the avatar choosing/assigning process, at least I don&#039;t. The info data base is out there to query to find out, but I myself can&#039;t so far. Others claim to have accessed this info. When we are immersed in the reality (birth) there is a memory constraint placed on the observer which makes it hard/impossible to remember pre-existence.", "time": 1673362081, "resto": 15113246}, {"no": 15113396, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)10:05:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15113246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15113246</a><br>If you are interested in how our probabilistic consciousness based virtual (informational) physical reality works and how the freewill awareness unit (consciousness/player/observer)&#039;s choices fit in to this, see vid here<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMI<wbr>mjFYZ1iY&amp;list=PLQ0PXV3djGQuZJpC99bd<wbr>6cZIOLnz1BV-w&amp;index=32<br>He talks slow, so speed it to x1.5<br>So every \u0394 of planck time, a random draw from a prob distribution of possible future outcomes is drawn then update.

For you possess not a single belief that is ancient and derived from old tradition, nor is your understanding grey with age. [22c] And this is the cause: There have been and there will be many and diverse destructions of humankind. The greatest destructions will be by fire and water, and the lesser ones by countless other means. For instance, you have a story about how Phaethon son of Helios yoked his father\u2019s chariot and, because he was unable to drive it along the course taken by his father, burned up all that was upon the earth and himself perished by a thunderbolt. That story, as it is told, has the form of a legend, but the truth of it lies in [22d] the occurrence of a shifting of the bodies in the heavens which move round the earth, and a destruction of the things on the earth by fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals. At such times all those dwelling on the mountains and in high and dry places suffer destruction more than those who dwell near to rivers or the sea.

For any real numbers a and b, if a&lt;b, then there exists real number c such that a&lt;c&lt;b. Suppose 0.99\u2026 &lt; 1. Then there must be some real value x such that 0.99\u2026 &lt; x &lt; 1. Notice that 0.99\u2026 = sum of (9/10^i) as i goes from 1 to infinity.<br>Since all real values can be defined as an infinite decimal expansion, and x &lt; 1, we can define x by the infinite sequence Sn such that x = sum of Si/10^i as i goes from 1 to infinity. Define 0.99\u2026 similarly, using the sequence Tn instead. It is trivial to see that, for all i, Ti = 9. Also note that for all i in [1, infinity), 9 &gt;= Si. But in order for 0.99\u2026 &gt; x to hold true, there must exist at least some i in [1, infinity) such that Si &gt; Ti. Obviously none exists, since as stated before, Si &lt;= 9 = Ti for all i in [1, infinity).

Suppose I have 3 genes and 3 populations, we can represent the presence of the gene in the population with an &quot;O&quot; and absence with an &quot;X&quot;.

Then rethink this analogy, instead of an X or an O genes work at frequencies and are called SNPs, I&#039;ll use CATG. So a population X may have an A at gene 1 at a frequency of 50% and a G for the remaining 50. Population Y has an A at 100% of their population, and population Z has an A at 20% and G at the rest. But it gets more complicated because in real life despite many populations sharing genes, what&#039;s called the &quot;haplotype&quot; or the SNPs surrounding said SNP can be different, so for populations X, Y and Z said SNP can serve different functions or be slightly modified by linkage disequilibrium around it. Really haplotypes look more like colors than anything. Population X&#039;s dominant haplotype can look dark blue, population Y&#039;s will look purple and Z&#039;s red. Blue is a lot closer to purple than either is to red, so X and Y are more closely related than either are to Z.<br><br>So to answer what your question what race is is that we&#039;ve found a peculiar phenomena where populations share a certain set of &quot;background&quot; haplotypes which each population might have a slightly different color, so Brits have cherry red, Italians burgundy, French merlot and Swedish auburn, but they&#039;re all just variations of red.

I think the main reason for your impression is that contrarians and retards are more entertaining and thus make the news and algorithms in disproportionate numbers. From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

The ideal would be to find a fusion between the two which is what most of modern philosophy stretching back to the early age of enlightenment has tried to do and has largely failed. Carl Jung is probably the most recent that has come the closest by trying to merge largely Nietzscheian ideas with a metaphysics, particularly with the batshit crazy idea of the collective unconscious and the unexplained reality of synchronicity. Another would probably be Schr\u00f6dinger where he postulated in an essay that perhaps consciousness is some form of &quot;matter&quot; for a lack of a better word that permeates through the universe but is unconscious and only becomes conscious through life.

Here, he was placed under the tutelage of Patrick Blackett, an experimental physicist later made famous for his work on cosmic rays and paleomagnetism. This was not a successful pairing; due to his own ineptitude in the laboratory, Oppenheimer became envious of Blackett\u2019s skills as an experimental physicist. Indeed, Oppenheimer initially wished to study experimental physics, but was prevented from doing so because of his \u201cclumsiness\u201d in the lab.<br><br>In 1926, in a fit of psychological despair while on vacation in Corsica, Oppenheimer confessed to his two accompanying friends that he had to return to Cambridge immediately. The reason? Before he had left for vacation, he had coated an apple in noxious laboratory chemicals and placed it on Blackett\u2019s desk. Oppenheimer wanted to make sure that Blackett was alright.<br><br>Fortunately, he was. Unfortunately, the university\u2019s administration had been informed of his little \u201cprank\u201d and intended to press charges, because prestigious institutions like Cambridge usually look down on students murdering the faculty. It was only through the intervention of his parents that Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t charged; indeed, he was placed on academic probation and ordered to undergo regular psychiatric evaluations. Finally, at the end of 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge at the invitation of Max Born to study theoretical physics at the University of Gottingen.&quot;<br><br>He was a devoted Communist who formed cabals with other Jews, and a lying rat who seemed to lie about anything and everything including seemingly framing goys as spies to remove them from the project, which he of course was joined on by no other than king fraud himself Einstein.", "time": 1673288660, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15111394, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:25:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15110000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15110000</a><br><br>Every goy intellectual like newton, tesla etc. all have the same personality type where they are very reserved, quiet and just want to do their work.

The way I see it, consulting companies in poor countries are a force for evil. McKinsey itself has as revenue the GDP of a small country so if they get involved they can move more money around than the politicians can even imagine. However even in rich nations consultants seem to be generally detrimental. There was that famous story of how McKinsey charged the french government $500,000 just to give a presentation, and then due to scheduling issues said presentation never happened. It is like a tax on the people and I&#039;d even say it is a regressive tax because the people getting paid this money are usually from rich families. I mean, it is that way in my country at least.

Like CS and math. But for example I got my master&#039;s in control systems. The best undergrad to take if you like control systems is mechatronics. But no good control systems master&#039;s program is ever going to require mechatronics undergrad because all of control systems can be learned and understood abstractly as &quot;systems&quot; and applied math. Like for example, to determine the stability of a &quot;system&quot; (like say a chemical plant) you can use nyquist stability criterion. This is based on Cauchy&#039;s argument principle, an obscure deep mathematical result that has nothing to do with mechatronics and that you arent going to understand without knowing complex analysis. So on the other hand, even though you need a degree in mathematics to understand even classical control theory tools, it would be ridiculous to allow only mathematics undergrads into the program. So in any control systems master&#039;s program you will never do any real embedded work (you can control systems with abstract block diagram environments like MATLB Simulink) and they avoid any programming really besides MATLAB or LabView generally (which they teach you from scratch) because they don&#039;t expect you to know how to program, and they don&#039;t even really expect you to intuitively understand the mathematics involved (even though its all applied math) because even math majors would struggle with this, so it&#039;s always going to end up as a conversion program for everyone involved, not really building off of any particular STEM undergrad knowledge", "time": 1673430560, "resto": 15097579}, {"no": 15115577, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15114849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15114849</a><br>At some point in your career, you want to switch into management.

In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn&#039;t properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.<br>I just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as &quot;only eating meat&quot; which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.<br>In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because &quot;nobody wants it.&quot; Really? That&#039;s his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don&#039;t want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.", "filename": "Bill+nye+saves+nothing+i+was+expecting+more_6ee47a_6481043", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673289123181194, "time": 1673289123, "md5": "Dxz4V4HkKckp+FliQMyuJQ==", "fsize": 141755, "resto": 15089892}, {"no": 15111409, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:33:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn&#039;t reduce the acidity level of a solution.

Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don&#039;t know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn&#039;t change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits.

The smaller the clusters of electrons i.e. the lower the voltage, the faster the electrons will disperse from a transistor in the &quot;off&quot; configuration. The lower we can turn down the voltage, the higher we can increase clock speed. If we can decrease this operating voltage low enough, we can consider attainable clock speeds in the hundreds of GHz.<br><br>How, then, can we ensure the delivery of ultra-low voltage pulses throughout a processor? The answer is Hall Effect Mitigation via Spin Reinitialization at Regular Intervals along a conducting wire.<br><br>In 2021, I put forth the notion that the Standard Model&#039;s current description of particle spin was erroneous and that a variety of spin values between &quot;1/2 spin&quot; and &quot;full spin&quot; were possible. When it comes to the Hall Effect, something must determine which electrons peel off from the desired path and when. As it turns out, spin velocity is highly germane to Hall Effect mitigation.<br><br>I therefore propose borrowing structures from my superconducting nickelate-cuprate-lithium wire concept that can be used intermittently along the length of a hydrogen nanowire such as that used in the cutting-edge processor designs of today. As you may recall, in that configuration, the valence electron of a single lithium atom is held in a fixed position by a combination of nickel and copper. The Coulomb Force Lines generated by the cuprate are used to restrict the range of positions that the lithium&#039;s two sub-valence electrons may occupy. The magnetic field of the nickelate complements the effect by controlling the spin orientation of the sub-valence electrons of the lithium, causing the lithium&#039;s own internal magnetic field to lock its valence electron into place.", "time": 1673480523, "resto": 15117024, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15117031, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)18:43:18", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "That structure, because of its projection of both a subtle magnetic and Coulomb force, is ideal for our application: Reinitializing or restoring to full value the forward spin of the electrons flowing through the nanowire prior to spin velocity degradation.

About three angstroms rear of the point along the nanowire where a pair of bracketing MFS Electron Barriers are emplaced, the hydrogen nanowire is modified so that rather than having one hydrogen in a 1D-configuration, has two atoms side-by-side. This would ordinarily be corruptive since it would cause electrons to divert toward the edge of the wire and to be dumped into the silicon insulation. Instead, since these electrons are met by a barrier consisting of a MFS electron, the electrons are yanked first toward the edge of the wire and then jerked back on path in a single maneuver.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

Verbal IQ can be used to reason deductively from a set of axioms. However, the people I described are very bad at formulating those axioms.
