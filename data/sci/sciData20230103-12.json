Dead languages are also acceptable as they approximate to being pseudocode most of the time.<br><br>I have to make a lot of multidimensional arrays full of booleans go faster and get bigger.<br><br>Wikipedia said somebody called Grzegorczyk made Grzegorczyk Hierarchy and that it uses Successor Function to make arithmetic operators.

Here we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?

The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.<br><br>Comments: 306 Pages.", "filename": "TIMESAND___particles==", "ext": ".png", "w": 996, "h": 339, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 42, "tim": 1672694738169450, "time": 1672694738, "md5": "cX7qa+60VLIhRJcy5tNs7Q==", "fsize": 33414, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095592, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:11", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095591</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694771055141, "time": 1672694771, "md5": "cz56Nz83qwgR/PURAssFGQ==", "fsize": 3532348, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095593, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:26:50", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095592</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_B.jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694810241441, "time": 1672694810, "md5": "lZ4x9Pg2IMP2l7FqKLdHQA==", "fsize": 3284973, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095595, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:29:05", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095593</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672694945726281, "time": 1672694945, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095779, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:22:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where SUSY particles?", "time": 1672701741, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095860, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095779</a><br>What&#039;s SASSY particles?", "time": 1672705323, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15095867, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095860</a><br>female particles. they produce many daughter particles.", "time": 1672705531, "resto": 15095535}, {"no": 15096327, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)00:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15095557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15095557</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t really know</span><br>Yes I do.

Basically, its a bit like bingo. You can choose between 2 numbers and 10 numbers on one row. The amount of numbers you choose sets up your prize money ( 2 out of 2 gives 1 dollar and 10 out of 10 gives you 10 dollars as an example ). And I have data on the last 100 or so draws, they draw everyday so I can play everyday. I noticed however that the row price ( basically the bet you place ) only goes from 50 cents up to 100 dollars. getting 10 out of 10 has an odds of 1:2million something. But I dont need to play the big game to get a price. Simply getting 5 out of 5 on a 10 dollar bet would give me 2k. 4 out of 4 will give me 350 dollars. I already had a trial run and I got no less than atleast 2 numbers right and hit 5 numbers, but since I didnt understand the game I didnt really profit on this, but it was enough to give me a chance today. if I luck out today I can get 7 dollars for a 1 dollar bet, which would allow me to bet even more tomorrow. I can choose between playing it low-risk low-reward with a low bet but many rows ( important ) or high risk high reward with fewer rows. The importance of rows is that I need variety as it is a lottery game so nothing is guaranteed, but STILL I can make the chances go in my favour at the cost of the prize money, BUT AGAIN, if i luck out I get EVEN MORE prize money. Is there something I am not seeing or have I struck a diamond mine? They pick 20 numbers out of 1-70. if I play with 3-4 rows I am almost guaranteed a win.

The imbecile doesn&#039;t even understand evolutionary theory, and fitness in particular. Fitness is the grand tautology in evolutionary theory. The organisms that are more fit are those organisms that pass on their genes. That&#039;s it. Idiots often load the term with additional meaning, like &quot;healthier, stronger, faster, being able to outcompete&quot; but the simple mathematical reality is that &quot;fitness&quot; is merely a population-level calculus of what survives into the next generation. There is no intrinsic fitness of an organism. Not its previous evolutionary history, not its physical abilities, not its available resources. None of that. Those are mere influencers of the LIKELYHOOD of fitness, i.e. the likelihood of passing on your genes to your descendants. But fitness is fitness. If you had a population of rabbits and randomly killed half of them before they got to reproduce, the half that survives are BY DEFINITION more fit than the ones that died. it really is that simple. So when this imbecile constructs a model in which &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;reality perception&quot; are antagonistic, it is a matter of mathematical tautology that &quot;reality perception&quot; would go extinct, since in his VERY MODEL IT IS NOT FIT.<br><br>Moron.

The problem is like most studies involving IQ development they usually ignore the prenatal stage of development which is just as important since that&#039;s where neurogenisis first takes place.<br><br>Trying to properly address IQ after the prenatal stage is like trying correct a design flaw after the product has been manufactured.

Tooker<br>https://vixra.org/abs/2206.0152<br>The purpose is to review and lay out a plan for future inquiry pertaining to the modified cosmological model (MCM) and its overarching research program. The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672712229345485, "time": 1672712229, "md5": "cz56Nz83qwgR/PURAssFGQ==", "fsize": 3532348, "resto": 15095367}, {"no": 15096022, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:17:45", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15096021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096021</a><br>http://gg762.net/d0cs/papers/Sixty-<wbr>Six_Theses__v2-20220726.pdf", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_B.jpg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672712265598563, "time": 1672712265, "md5": "lZ4x9Pg2IMP2l7FqKLdHQA==", "fsize": 3284973, "resto": 15095367}, {"no": 15096024, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:18:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15096019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096019</a><br><a href=\"#p15096021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096021</a><br>tooker, my man. how are you doing these days? do you have housing security yet? or are you still living in abandoned houses? this isn&#039;t meant to be some refutation against your work; i&#039;m legitimately interested in your well being man. you&#039;re my favorite person on this board.", "time": 1672712297, "resto": 15095367}, {"no": 15096025, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:18:20", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15096022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096022</a><br><a href=\"#p15096022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096022</a>", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672712300937071, "time": 1672712300, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 15095367}, {"no": 15096044, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:29:20", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15096024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15096024</a><br>I am very unwell.

This means that men are generally faster thinkers, able to process things quicker and forming conclusions faster. Women, on the other hand, often take longer to form conclusions but tend to pick up on subtle nuances and details more quickly.<br><br>In terms of other genetic differences, male brains are larger and contain slightly more grey matter than female brains. This may explain why males excel at certain skills such as spatial positioning or mathematical ability while females tend to be better at language comprehension, memory recall, and emotional understanding. This may result from different concentrations in hormones like testosterone impacting brain development before birth. <br><br>Additionally, there is evidence that suggests some parts of the brain correlate with different genders differently. For example, female brains develop structures related to social communication associated with verbal processing earlier than male brains do. There is also evidence that suggests boy\u2019s brains contain greater connectivity between regions involved in motor functioning (ability to process physical movement) and technical reasoning.

I wanted to go into a field in which I have many options and thus thought mechatronics would be the way to go, and actually cybersecurity was on my list as well since I watched a lot of videos on that and did some firmware reverse engineering and so on.<br>I ended up studying physics, and I am very happy with it. If you don&#039;t have any experience with university yet and have to decide what to do it is easy to fall into the trap of associating majors directly with what you will work on later in your life. Mechatronical systems are cool as hell and having an understanding of all the parts sounds great, but in practice you will probably just end up doing one niche part for some bigger system and your goal should be to optimize your chances to get into more interesting niches and not to get an understanding of as many niches as possible. And that&#039;s where math or physics graduates set themselves apart. With a deeper knowledge of math compared to the average engineer they can often get assigned the more &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; tasks. I put those in quotes because that of course is highly subjective, but in many fields you will realize that in order to understand and work with the more elementary methods, you need to have a really good understanding of math first.<br>Take for example cryptography as a really interesting sub-field of cybersecurity. It is the most math heavy, but working in this field will be much more interesting (at least in my opinion) than doing basic pentesting stuff where you don&#039;t even need to know how the exploits work and just use some scanners on different servers every day.<br><br>Of course you should take this just as inspiration to think in another direction from someone who changed his mind from wanting to do engineering to actual science.

They have money goals. I say this because often you hear people saying &quot;Oh, I&#039;d love to do consulting&quot; or &quot;Oh, I&#039;d love be a software engineer&quot;. But you dig deeper and consulting is a stressful and morally disgusting job that barely anyone actually enjoyes. And most people going the softeng route have no interest in computers beyond that currently useful programming languages. I.e. they have no actual passion for the job. They just want to get the money.<br><br>Now, I will admit that this is half true. Yes, I work for the money.

So in a sense my career goals are a middle ground between the jobs I would tolerate doing and the jobs that pay me enough to sustain my lifestyle.<br><br>You want to get some motivation to build a career? Start craving money. For me, I didn&#039;t much care about my career until I was 2 years into university and suddenly my family had economic troubles. I quickly realized that my parents were not going to be able to fund my lifestyle any longer and you would be surprised how fast I went from an idealist to a realist. <br><br>So think about it. How much money do you need to be satisfied? Odds are you need as much money as your parents had when raising you as anything below that you&#039;ll feel like a failure. Now, look for the jobs that can pay enough for that... and there you go. That is your career goal.

Unclear who takes his place. But it seems under him, he&#039;s setup a lot of awards towards SpaceX to ensure that whoever inherits its position, they can&#039;t fuck with the current momentum. Nelson, ironically, redeemed himself with commercial space and SpaceX&#039;s partnership after being properly bought into the fold, the same way that Bridenstine was. Nelson was in a talk with some USAF general, and that general basically just gave it to Bill straight, that because of SpaceX with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, the USAF/gov thereby has been saved $40Bn in cost to get to orbit. That $40Bn as a result has been reallocated to future projects simultaneously. That&#039;s more capability that the US will project in the coming years as a result. Nelson said those words in a congressional testimony. Since that day, he&#039;s basically pushed in favor of SpaceX as far as his political acumen will allow.<br><br>But he too likely sees the writing on the wall, that present admin isn&#039;t happy with this behavior. Elon is at odds with said admin on nearly every front, some of it justified, some of it arguable. He&#039;s done enough to prep SpaceX to continue into the HLS Starship phase of the program, and now wants out, before the infighting between Tesla/present admin bleeds over into SpaceX/NASA partnership and potentially fucks things up unnecessarily, and in consequence, breaks what&#039;s been working incredibly well thus far.<br><br>That way, if something does go wrong, the fault will align with whoever the administration will appoint next and the geopolitical consequences of that, can be laid squarely at the feet of the appointee. Especially since, for the last 2-ish years, he&#039;s been hammering away at Congressional committees that China is copying SpaceX hard and are working to recreate their own Apollo program for Moon AND Mars, and that Congress isn&#039;t taking this threat seriously enough.
