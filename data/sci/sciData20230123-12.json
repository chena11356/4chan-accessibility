Then two scientific papers are released at the same time by different labs and one paper found a correlation with the vaccine and heart attacks and the other paper found no correlation using a different sample group of the same size. Then if you were aware of both papers and their outcomes but you only chose to read the paper that says there&#039;s no correlation and you ignored the other paper and went around telling people only about the paper that shows there&#039;s no correlation then that&#039;s a cognitive bias.

And probably increases their sales too if they can spin a lot of drama to keep people interested. The media doesn&#039;t seem to always outright lie about things though, they more just lie by omission, which is like a cognitive bias on their end and reality is being filtered through their biases so the news you get is pre biased.

His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing. Given the correlation between wealth and intelligence of 0.8 its fairly safe to assume that Newtons late father was an, at least reasonably, intelligent man.

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

Often all at once and then it flows down the valleys and it&#039;s dry again the next week.<br>Next you import as much biomass as you can get. Truckloads of agricultural waste of any kind. Mulch all your earthworks heavily. The organic matter reduces evaporation and erosion, stores water like a sponge and composts to improve the soil. <br>Next you plant drought hardy plants with heavy focus on trees. Acacia, tagasaste, date palms... Plant cover provides more shade and biomass to further improve the soil. You might need some irrigation for a few years to establish these, if conditions are harsh. You&#039;ll need A LOT of very hardy plants.<br>After a basic plant cover is there, you can underplant productive trees like citrus, figs or almonds. <br>At that point you probably have a restored water table, can dig a well and have a small amount of settlement.<br>Most importantly, keep the goatherders of the area. They&#039;ll eat it all back to desert in no time.<br><br>Look at what china of all places is accomplishing.

The experiential states of this primordial will did not include perception of a seemingly external world, for there was no such world yet. Instead, they entailed only endogenous feelings. Moreover, the dispositions or impetus inherent to these feelings triggered self-stimulation or self-excitation of the will, which in turn led to the latter\u2019s unfolding into the known universe.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The primordial impetus of the will is towards self-understanding: it yearns instinctively\u2014i.e. not meta-cognitively\u2014to figure out explicitly what it wills and why. Without self-understanding, the will drowns in the maelstrom of its own unfolding. It is this irresistible impulse that, through self-excitation according to the will\u2019s natural modes, led and still leads to the rise of living organisms: the images of local, dissociative configurations of the will\u2014alters\u2014that seemingly split off from the rest so to be able to contemplate it as object.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With life, there arose the world as representation\u2014i.e. the image of the will as it presents itself from across a dissociative boundary\u2014which, in turn, enabled re-representation.

I can imagine screen and still &quot;see&quot; it. So what are we seeing here? We&#039;re just seeing an internal model of the screen.

A model that someone thinks of themselves. Their physical body (as in the case of &quot;out of body experience&quot;). But how can the physical body be the observer? Its not but thats the best thing they have. <br>So then it shifts back to &quot;well, sure its a model&quot; &quot;but i exist when I observe something.&quot; Do you?

Flushed toilets emit aerosols that spread pathogens contained in feces, but little is known about the spatiotemporal evolution of these plumes or the velocity fields that transport them. Using laser light to illuminate ejected aerosols we quantify the kinematics of plumes emanating from a commercial flushometer-type toilet, and use the motion of aerosol particles to compute velocity fields of the associated flow. The toilet flush produces a strong chaotic jet with velocities exceeding 2 m/s; this jet transports aerosols to heights reaching 1.5 m within 8 seconds of initiating a flush. Quantifying toilet plumes and associated flow velocities provides a foundation for future design strategies to mitigate plume formation or to disinfect pathogens within it.</span><br><br>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022<wbr>-12-green-lasers-reveal-toilet-lid.<wbr>html<br><br>https://youtube.com/watch?v=w90JNBg<wbr>kqJ0<br>In the context of toilet design and infectious diseases like covid19.<br>At least https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toile<wbr>t_plume should get updated with these new images.", "filename": "68d1fd36f6e4e5d359b18243be112d65d194a63e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1218, "h": 1700, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674386087136515, "time": 1674386087, "md5": "MUDAAbiFzaZu/Io7aiZ/8g==", "fsize": 327679, "resto": 15141559}, {"no": 15144139, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)11:18:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15141822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15141822</a><br>Useful and interesting thread, but terrible OP.", "filename": "1633371075002", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5184, "h": 3456, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674404337277534, "time": 1674404337, "md5": "aSJvKqWkaNFAbdHvIZHEmw==", "fsize": 1602251, "resto": 15141559}, {"no": 15145077, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)17:23:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144139</a> Are you referring to the original post?

Yet this practice of writing down a finite list of finite lists and writing an ellipsis at the end of each element of the list and writing a vertical ellipsis below the last element of the list somehow, without any reasonable explanation, denotes that this is now an INFINITE LIST OF INFINITE LISTS. And then they all pretend somehow that they each can perform an infinite number of actions all at once (in fact, it&#039;s prescribed as an &quot;axiom&quot;) when no reasonable person would ever pretend so.

Once the physical system (universe) is shown to be a contingent entity (it is contingent because it began, so it demands an explanation/cause), then there follows the logical necessity for and entity possessing at least some of the attributes commonly ascribed to god, namely the ability to initiate systems such as the physical (virtual) universe, and the attribute of not being temporally constrained. So not bound by time (cycles). The non-contingent entity (god) is called a necessary being in philosophical terms. Aquinas coined this term. Leibnitz formed arguments based on this concept as well. It was a way to express informally logically the necessity for a creator without bringing a particular theology into it. So the contingent being (universe) demands a cause/explanation for it&#039;s existence. the cause can&#039;t itself also be contingent, ie have a beginning, or else you get an infinite regress of contingent entities, ie &#039;well, if god created the universe, then who created god&#039;, ad infinitum. So the regress can be avoided by just postulating a single entity which wasn&#039;t itself booted up, ie not temporally constrained, ie didn&#039;t begin/outside of time (cycles).

It never stated that there was some truth that is unreachable under any system. What it says is that as long as some technical concepts are met by your formal system (throwing away any of them is not acceptable as a foundation for math) then there exists a sentence that means something wich your formal system cant derive under its deduction laws. Those kind of things can be proven from outside but what is important is that the thing that proves it has to be necesarily a more powerful system, and as long as the system is more powerful it also meets the conditions of the theorem wich leads you to the same situation. What it really says is that if you lock your ways of proving stuff to only formal ones then you are bounded to have some stuff that you wont be able to prove or disprove, hence there is no system with finite list of axioms in wich true stuff is recursive, unless its inconsistent of course in wich case it talks about nothing.
