The need for this correction arises when we measure the distance to a supernova from its brightness because the way we see a supernova is also affected by the universe\u2019s expansion. Besides causing the redshift, cosmic expansion also dilates (expands) time intervals over which supernova light is collected, changes the size of the increments in brightness, and shifts the portion of the spectrum we observe. (A physicist would mutter about need for \u201crelativistic corrections\u201d). Brian and I iterated back and forth a few times before we were both comfortable applying these corrections.

The basic reason why there is a difference is in how astronomers measure distance, which is with redshift.<br><br>If we take a very simple model and assume there is no acceleration or deceleration and the Hubble constant is fixed. If we see a galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.233, which is a recession velocity of 70,000 km/s. This is the velocity that comes from measuring the shift in the galaxies light with the expansion of the universe. If we believe the Hubble constant (H_0) is 70 km/s/Mpc then we infer a distance to this galaxy of 70000/70 = 1000 Mpc (megaparsecs). But what if the universe were expanding faster? Well, we still measured a redshift of z=0.233. So say, H=700 km/s/Mpc then the distance we estimate is only 100 Mpc. 10 times less. So we see that if the universe is expanding faster a given redshift implies a lower distance.<br><br>This also applies when thinking about acceleration, in this case we say the Hubble constant today is the same regardless.

In cosmology, red shift is a proxy measurement for distance due to Hubble expansion. However, the observed distribution is not consistent with Hubble expansion because the data shows too many galaxies at higher redshift. The first way that people imagined this distribution could occur was if the spatial part of the universe was expanding increasing quickly as time goes by. However, exciting new data from the JWST shows that the properties of high-Z objects (high redshift) are more consistent with expansion in the time sector of spacetime rather than the space sector.

So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

The prairie grass&#039;s deep roots prevented soil erosion, but after they were gone it dried out and could be blown off by the wind even, hence why dustbowls happened. Most of the plains now has a shallow layer of topsoil even 100 years later on top of a thick clay layer, then bedrock.<br><br>In the great plains trees are a nuisance. They don&#039;t naturally grow because of the intense prairie fires the region is prone to. Chopping down trees unironically is good for the health of the region, since the native grasses have such massive rootsystems, if the tops are burned off they just regrow.

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right. One must always take the smallest available size of a colour, but the larger sizes are obviously more powerful, so bank management is an important aspect of the game.<br>I found it via <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/catalog#s=bgg%2C\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/bgg,</a> and you can play it online on bga.", "time": 1674648904, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152201, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>Anything board game related with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; ?", "time": 1674649967, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152263, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)08:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Onions (japanese shitgames) can be found on <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a>", "time": 1674652296, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152372, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)09:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152201</a><br>Stratego?", "time": 1674656896, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152509, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>The different characters should have different shillouettes<br>If you disagree, you are contrarion.", "time": 1674663385, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152895, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144090</a><br>Which for humans, is always", "time": 1674675057, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15153740, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This game I invented called empty go.

During the attack phase you can choose to attack any number of your opponents pieces. If you attack an enemy piece your opponents can choose to defend it. In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board. This is done by pulling the twine taught above the board. In other words there must be a straight line connecting the piece to each side of the board for it to be defended. However, lines cannot pass through an enemy piece. During the maneuver phase place one piece on the board. You cannot play on top of or overlap another piece. Pieces can hang off the edge if the board as long as their center is on it. If you cannot place a piece, you lose.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation.

Self-reference generally results in paradox because it is simply incoherent. So when you say that we are conscious of our consciousness, or whatever, you should be really precise in what you mean. I can close my eyes, and notice the lack of visual stimuli that I normally see. Likewise I can close my ears, hold my nose, etc. I can also be conscious of the fact that time passes when I\u2019m asleep, and yet I have no memories of any conscious stimuli when I \u2018m asleep.

Anyone who has ever seen an automobile wreck knows that weight provides protection to a solid, ballistic object during a collision. Oftentimes, however, whichever object is moving faster, even when weights are identical, will better survive a collision not because of its weight, but because of its higher velocity. The product of mass and velocity determines energy and energy will always tend to flow from areas of higher concentration to those of lower concentration. For solid objects, this means that the object receiving net energy must experience the greatest G-forces. This abrupt change in direction that causes damage to an object can be traced to the injection of energy into that object, which in turn, can be traced to the asymmetry of energies.<br><br>When it comes to weather systems, while the momentum of pressure systems, the difference between the pressure levels of the two systems, and the activity of other bodies in neighboring areas do, indeed, remain the primary factors to consider if one wishes to accurately predict the future motion of these bodies, in the absence of complete knowledge of the state of the atmosphere, the relative height of the atmospheric envelope stands out as a heretofore overlooked variable we can easily measure that has the potential, in my judgment, to eliminate a great deal of uncertainty from the existing global forecast models.<br><br>The Future Is Made in America<br>30Jan2023", "time": 1675084751, "resto": 15164608, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15164642, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)08:41:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Uh huh life&#039;s like this", "time": 1675086111, "resto": 15164608}, {"no": 15165517, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)16:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why don&#039;t you do it yourself/petition someone who can to do this?", "time": 1675113591, "resto": 15164608}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15164715, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)09:46:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "/sci/ bros which book do you use for learning Matrix and related stuff?

See pic, especially my favorite part, here<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is now overwhelming biological and behavioral evidence that the brain contains no stable, high-resolution, full field representation of a visual scene, even though that is what we subjectively experience (Martinez-Conde et al. 2008). The structure of the primate visual system has been mapped in detail (Kaas and Collins 2003) and there is no area that could encode this detailed information.</span><br>The subjective experience is thus inconsistent with the neural circuitry. This is just the visual binding problem by the way, there are many more.<br>Note: Notice they don&#039;t say &#039;the circuitry hasn&#039;t yet been found&#039;. The whole thing has been ALREADY BEEN MAPPED. Subjective experience is INCONSISTENT WITH NEURAL CIRCUITRY. So there is no one to one correspondence between brain and mind. So any &#039;physicalism of the gaps&#039; model fails. Any appeal to a one to one mapping some day FAILS. The computational theory of mind FAILS to account for consciousness. Computation is ONE of the things that consciousness DOES, as well as reasoning. We also already know that humans minds can harness computation to mimic some of the things that their own consciousnesses DO, but this says nothing about creating an experiencer to experience such experiences. You can&#039;t do that . A piece of virtual meat in spacetime is not the seat of consciousness and software created BY consciousnesses (that&#039;s what AI is) immersed in a VR is also NOT the seat of a consciousness either. This piece of meat you think creates consciousness never even needs to beed rendered ie have defined measurements in spacetime unless measured/observed, at which time what is probable to be there will be there, the same as with all matter.
