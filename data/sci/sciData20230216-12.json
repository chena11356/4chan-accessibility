In 1975 Collins voiced to Maynard Smith the view that natural selection could not drive evolution because it always acted to reduce variation in favour of an optimum type for any environment, whereas the central story of evolution was that of increasing variation and complexity. Collins quoted Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (&quot;... unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.&quot;), and argued that if variation must always occur before natural selection can act, then variation, and not natural selection, drives evolution. He asked Maynard Smith whether he could search for a &quot;strong&quot; theory of variation. Maynard Smith warned Collins that he could not support his efforts to pursue a rival theory to the theory that natural selection drives evolution. Collins replied that he thought the object of science was to question and examine everything, including hallowed theories such as the theory of natural selection. Maynard Smith asserted that, on the contrary, the strength of science was its capacity to agree on certain principles, and act collectively to pursue agreed aims. This difference of view with his tutor made Collins give up his scientific career and pursue other interests instead.</span><br>the darwinian theory is protected from all criticism by it&#039;s keepers, it is held beyond the reach of anyone who might take a pass at discrediting it. how fragile it must be to need that protection", "time": 1676236440, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197823, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:14:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197813</a><br>Look up Gregor Mendel, you retard.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?</span>", "time": 1676236451, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197832, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197823</a><br>How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?", "time": 1676236640, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197841, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:19:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197832</a><br>How do you know he wasn&#039;t?", "time": 1676236751, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197848, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:21:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197841</a><br>I don&#039;t", "time": 1676236868, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197863, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197761</a><br>That&#039;s only microevolution.

Then the RNA in triplets is translated to proteins based on shape as recognised by the 20 tRNA molecules and sqeezed together by the ribosomes. The chain of amino acyds are folded based on hydrofobic nature and is kept in shape by that and sulfide bridges of cysteins. Proteins then preform the houseceeping functions of the cells as well as making any secretions, extracellular matrix componetns, determine cell shape, cell-cell interactions etc. Cell diffferentiation is determined by differing concentration gradients of secreted transcription factors such as the hox genes.

Analysis can be thought of as studying the properties of topological spaces (basically a space with a fundamental structure; we only care about the properties preserved under &quot;continuous&quot; deformations like &quot;stretching&quot; and &quot;bending&quot; but without ripping it, or making any holes) with a notion of &quot;distance&quot; (metric), and especially the functions between such spaces. Within here there will include properties that one can study such as the &quot;volume&quot; (measure) of sets -- sets that are uglier and more complex than one might be accustomed to. Note I am being abstract here. Real Analysis and Complex analysis, deal with the spaces [math]\\mathbb{R}^n[/math] and [math]\\mathbb{C}^n[/math] respectively. <br>Calculus is then a set of tools derived from these fields, which are then applicable to real world problems. Here we have derivatives, integrals, how to solve them in various dimensions etc.<br>As for what books, it depends on your level of maturity. If you are familiar with the ideas of calculus and have a HS level understanding of mathematics, then you can probably move on to a Real Analysis book. I personally like Tao&#039;s and N.L.

In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.</span>", "time": 1676129136, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194224, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Guess how I know you&#039;re one of the illiterates who post frogs and sperg out about philosophy in every thread?", "time": 1676129302, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194227, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194221</a><br>A formal system is just a specific class of languages.", "time": 1676129397, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194229, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Pic related also explains at the very begging of the paper the sort of systems which it applies to", "filename": "On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathematica And Related Systems (Dover 1992)(Isbn 0486669807)(600Dpi)(T)(79S) Maml(1) - Kurt_Go\u0308del_On_Formally_Undecidabl[...]", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 1502, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129451092621, "time": 1676129451, "md5": "IXycNUT6PICtatAxz7PGRA==", "fsize": 402782, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194234, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194227</a><br>Mathematics is just a &quot;specific class of languages&quot;, then.

The things like the orbits of the planets with low uncertainty are are EFFECTIVELY deterministic since the probability distribution is as such that every cycle update the the random draw for an input will dictate that the planets stay on the course which is predictable to a high amout of decimal places but there is STILL some non-zero chance that a planet could tunnel from one side of the universe to the next, just as with quantum tunneling.

So the physical universe in terms of a history of the set of all values which were/are defined in spacetime as data streams to the set of all observers&#039; immersed in the reality is of course going to be a single history from a god&#039;s eye view perspective.

A series of studies published starting in the mid-2000s reported the discovery of a toxic form of A\u03b2 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer&#039;s disease called A\u03b2*56. Researchers hoped that A\u03b2*56 was the protein that snowballed into those amyloid plaques. But a team of sleuths found that many of the papers describing A\u03b2*56 were fraudulent and contained an array of faked images and blots.

His strongest pronouncement is that theologians and philosophers have no foundation in science for their contention that Nothing will always remain Nothing (p174). Here Krauss is making an interesting and provocative claim, but I think it is an overstatement. If one uses a natural scientific definition of Nothing, namely the lowest-energy state of a system, then it is a simple consequence of Schrodinger&#039;s equation that this state will never evolve in to any other state. Krauss suggests that fluctuations in the ground state can be the source of Something, but this is really just an artefact of using classical language which obscures the static and unchanging nature of the quantum mechanical ground state. The only way such so-called fluctuations can become real is through the influence of an environment consisting of additional degrees of freedom that, through a process called decoherence, effectively measure the state of the original system. But decoherence will not occur if the environment is also in its ground state (C. Kiefer and D. Polarski, Adv. Sci. Lett. 2, 164-173 (2009)). So, as long as we are in the realm of conventional quantum mechanics, current science supports the theologians: Nothing will always lead to Nothing.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1676478243, "resto": 15204603}, {"no": 15204615, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)11:25:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15204613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15204613</a><br>Conventional quantum mechanics, however, does not include the dynamical flexing of space that we think is an essential aspect of gravity. For that one would need a theory of quantum gravity. Krauss, as usual being admirably clear about the fact that he is stepping in to speculative uncertainty, outlines some ideas that have been suggested about the quantum-gravitational nucleation of baby universes and the possible origin of our universe from them. However, this does not imply that one is getting Something from Nothing. As Krauss himself notes (p182), theories of quantum gravity may not contain anything corresponding in a straightforward way to our current concepts of Nothing and Something. This leaves one unable to come to any scientific conclusions about questions involving these concepts.

Like, think about it, gasoline cars run on dinosaur juice, and burning that stuff produces all sorts of nasty gases that can mess with the air we breathe.

Plus, electric cars don&#039;t have to deal with all that engine noise and vibrations that gas cars make. They&#039;re smoother, more silent, and way cooler-looking.

It is fundamental in magnetism and can be said manifest itself in a Quantum mechanical setting. (Moreover the existence of \u00c6ther is not contradicted by any form of physics). All things in existence are fundamentally in the form of waves. You may have heard this as the &quot;particle-wave duality.&quot; Except it&#039;s a little more nuanced. Fundamentally a &quot;particle&quot; is simply a wave packet in the \u00c6ther with special properties of which is it difficult to delineate at this time. However it would be reasonable in order to consider a wave packet a particle to require that it&#039;s expected energy is constant in the absence of other waves and a fairly static &quot;radius&quot; as [math] \\frac{E}{c^2} [/math] or another suitable expression can be used to define &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot; and the center of the sphere with the given radius as its &quot;position&quot; (even though these are uncertain experimentally and statistically within the quantum mechanical models). What I would assert is that the source of the magnetic field is the electron wave packet is a particle and has a special type of \u00c6theric oscillations (likely related to spin) which causes dynamic wave packets to form in the \u00c6ther around it which manifest in the usual notation as the particle travels through the \u00c6ther.

While a woolly mammoth can&#039;t be attributed to human activity 100% it&#039;s still a good case study to start out with since it&#039;s a media sexy project. Additionally species that are critical to their environments could be brought back just for that, which woolly mammoths again qualify being important in their role at quite literally creating their own environment out of artic terrain by holding back forests and keeping the soil fertile increasing the diversity of the region.<br>On the other hand bringing back animals that died especially ones that died long ago like this might not be feasible or desirable. They might not survive in nature due to being poorly adapted to it or low gene pool or die out again for the same reasons that killed them before like hunting or environment destruction and effort instead is quite likely better spent on preserving current environments than a white elephant project like bringing back the mammoths. And while it might sound good for a 19th british chap to drive a species extinct back to back, bringing something alive only to lock it up in a zoo because it&#039;s not feasible to have them in the wild in real populations doesn&#039;t sound too good.<br>Lastly it can still be good despite of that because cloning research is important but it can be difficult to secure funds, mammoths are media sexy and there could be lot of funding so even if it&#039;s a white elephant project it could still be important to perform scientifically and could be a foundation for future more realistic projects like bringing back species that are dying right now from much more preserved and fresh samples in reconstructed habitats in the future.", "time": 1676387517, "resto": 15200719}, {"no": 15202556, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)11:55:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15202392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15202392</a><br>Plus everyone at the time agreed that Dodos were delicious.

You need to combine windmills with storage or build out an obscenely large amount to ensure you have enough electricity to supply at any given time. If you read studies on the EROI on wind, it varies a ton, usually hovering around either 4x and 40x, depending on if they include storage or not. There are different proposals for energy storage, each with their own upsides and downsides. Chemical batteries are the obvious one, but highly expensive and you&#039;d run into lithium shortages before you could do it worldwide. Gravity storage seems moderately promising (lifting concrete with a winch to store energy as gravity potential energy, releasing it to spin a turbine for electrical energy).

Got it for 100$ like new, it was one of the best purchases I&#039;ve ever did. Truly a bargain and the first time I did some star hopping it was a mesmerizing experience.<br><br>A few tips for the newbies:<br>- Always get a dobsonian. It&#039;s the best one price/quality-wise, because the money that doesn&#039;t get spent in a flimsy mount, actually goes to the telescope itself. Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

That&#039;s why we need proofs to make extra sure what we&#039;re saying is true. What we can do is decompose our reasoning, scrutinise and verify. Ai researchers are trying something like this by training language models that reach a conclusion sequentially through smaller, easier to verify steps. [Schizo ramblings ahead] One step reasoning leads to larger errors than multi step reasoning. Actually, i think dimensionality is key: consider a simplified model that take the set of all sentences of a fixed N dimensionality X, and mapsbit to iteself. Naturally the input might be the subset of questioning statements and the output as answers. You can think of the model as created a vector field on X, pointing a question toban answer. During training for one step reasoning, the model must learn over the full volume of X which will go something like X^N. This quickly gets intractable. Instead multistep reasoning presents of series of K lower complexity vectors in X of dimension M&lt;N. So instead you flow your way along lower dimensional (probabilistically that is) vectors to your answer. And clearly X^N will eventually always exceed in size than any K*X^M.<br><br>Interestingly, latter is more susceptible to chaotic behaviour so there&#039;s probably a fine balance to achieve.", "time": 1676424505, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15205190, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:36:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15199788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15199788</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmx<wbr>3zfe63ZQ<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S</span><br>T<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;U</span><br>P<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I</span><br>D<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;!!!!</span><br>!!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;!!!!</span><br>!!!!", "time": 1676497002, "resto": 15191908}, {"no": 15205845, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15191908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15191908</a><br>the anon who corresponds by handwritten letters with Uncle Ted is literally the best anon we\u2019ve ever had here", "time": 1676515683, "resto": 15191908}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15201746, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)01:39:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Why are all the whales dying?", "com": "What form of science is being used to murder these innocent whales, and why?", "filename": "AYg0b43UoYh6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 679, "h": 405, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 149, "tim": 1676356792568296, "time": 1676356792, "md5": "9MoaeXaGEP3QNoyZlysNrA==", "fsize": 56035, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-are-all-the-whales-dying", "replies": 20, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 33}, {"no": 15201789, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)02:13:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201746</a><br>40% are dying from being struck by ships and getting tangled in nets, 60% from other causes https://tbrnewsmedia.com/humpback-w<wbr>hale-deaths-increase-along-eastern-<wbr>seaboard/ who gives a shit though? im sure none of our activities will cause problems for us down the line", "filename": "61F4CE44-D107-4134-BB67-9D425165BD7C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 867, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676358836087306, "time": 1676358836, "md5": "A2N9W8G4/2Hw/41OQlhxXA==", "fsize": 43440, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15201821, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)02:38:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201789</a><br>i care, i wanna eat whales so i want them to stay healthy.", "time": 1676360327, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15201850, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)03:00:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201821</a><br>enjoy :)", "time": 1676361623, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15201910, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:01:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201821</a><br>Japan is the only nation still hunts whale for food, and yet they can&#039;t even sell the whale meat because it all contains more mercury than is legally allowed to be in food that&#039;s sold.<br><br>It&#039;s being stacked up in warehouses unable to do anything with it, yet they&#039;re still slaughtering whales.", "time": 1676365308, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15201915, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:04:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201910</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s being stacked up in warehouses unable to do anything with it, yet they&#039;re still slaughtering whales.</span><br>Fucking based!", "time": 1676365473, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15201917, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:07:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201910</a><br>that sounds like some kind of enviro hippie faggot propaganda, you liars tell shill the same story on every single topic, no matter what it is, the world is coming to an end in two weeks. go cry your eyes out for mother nature, soigoy, booo hooo hooo", "time": 1676365627, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15202132, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)06:34:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15201746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15201746</a><br>it&#039;s me<br>i just hate whales", "time": 1676374441, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15203065, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:18:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15202132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15202132</a><br>whales are good", "filename": "eat whales", "ext": ".png", "w": 466, "h": 96, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 25, "tim": 1676409513865330, "time": 1676409513, "md5": "r+b95Pv4Fz1j9wA8fvx1cA==", "fsize": 28521, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15203199, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)17:20:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s climate change, retards.", "time": 1676413212, "resto": 15201746}, {"no": 15203207, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)17:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15203199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15203199</a><br>Well that&#039;s been proven fake so it has to be something else.

I believe humans in general should be reformulated into a kind of immobile fleshbeasts that nevertheless manage to have all necessary organs for regular biological function, and have them permanently anchored into walls, where they would live out their rich and eventful (not sarcasm) lives in VR space. Of course, this is only possible once androids have proliferated to process raw material, minerals, nutrients etc. to keep this economy running.<br>The fleshbeasts would not look like Wall-E characters, but rather like meat bags completely optimized for this new sessile reality. The lack of skeletal musculature is not a problem, for more than obvious reasons. The apparent &quot;lack&quot; of sensory organs likewise is more feature than bug: the sensory organs still exist, but are permanently grafted onto technological VR equipment. I do not believe in sci-fi, and it&#039;s more than non-trivial to replicate scent (it&#039;s not a digital sense like sight or hearing), so the sense would simply be streamlined away.<br>Why do everything this, you ask?

Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references (&quot;crock recursion&quot;) can occur.</span><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video<wbr>_game_programming<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Game structure</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The central component of any game, from a programming standpoint, is the game loop. The game loop allows the game to run smoothly regardless of a user&#039;s input or lack thereof. Most traditional software programs respond to user input and do nothing without it. For example, a word processor formats words and text as a user types. If the user doesn&#039;t type anything, the word processor does nothing. Some functions may take a long time to complete, but all are initiated by a user telling the program to do something. Games, on the other hand, must continue to operate regardless of a user&#039;s input. The game loop allows this. A highly simplified game loop, in pseudocode, might look something like this :</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;while (user does not exit)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; check for user input</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; run AI</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; move enemies</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; resolve
