I&#039;m European and before university mathematics was my favourite subject and I went through the hardest mathematics grammar schools. It was my favourite because it was the only subject not dependent on rote anything, be it memory drill, or whatever. In this subject you could arrive at answers in tests through pure reasoning and not some rote piece of information you had to remember, such as was the case in history or biology. But as time went on and I met actual mathematicians and went to a pure maths program, it all quite ensoured me. In my early teenage years I&#039;ve not had particularly well developed critical thinking abilities. This meant I gave into the superstition of MBTI and through it I met MBTI communities. After realizing the nonsense it was, I returned to them and in there was a PhD graduate of pure mathematics. This person struggled to understand consistent human behavior across time is inherited through genetics, which are made up of a series of additive alleles, and how that entails the distribution of human behavior is gaussian, hence no binary dichotomy model such as MBTI could be valid. I tried to help him understand by explaining how that&#039;s exactly the same case as coin flips, hence the binomial, but he just wouldn&#039;t get it, and kept using ad hominem argumentation, without ever losing faith in his pseudoscience. And in regards of the pure maths program, there was nearly no reasoning. We&#039;ve had to remember 20 pages of definitions for god knows what reason from god knows where, essentially training us to be little bitchy parrots. When discussing having found a quicker solution, the TA agreed with my chain of reasoning, but said I should stick to the definition instead, with everyone glorifying drilling solving problems the way professor has done on the board over and over again, which made me remember this weaving-basket forum post of a humanities major trying mathematics and realizing it&#039;s all just a bunch", "filename": "image_2023-02-07_194919940", "ext": ".png", "w": 470, "h": 286, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1675795788451511, "time": 1675795788, "md5": "hCXeqcD5Btjt6x0knIbDCQ==", "fsize": 141142, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-having-a-crisis-of-faith-in-mathematics-im", "replies": 64, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 18}, {"no": 15184766, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)13:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15184765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15184765</a><br>of \u201cautists solving puzzles\u201d. As a child I briefly programmed in C, but in spite of being victorious in regional competitions, I quickly realized the people best at programming just keep programming all the time, and the tasks we were supposed to do in programming lessons or when I remembered programming were just so tedious and mundane. When I moved from C to Unity, I realized it was about remembering all the commands from all the various imported libraries, which I realized only several months of a quite fun time trying to figure out how to implement a region-triggered event. As such I decided never to touch programming again. But then seeing analysis in pure mathematics, that\u2019s exactly how it felt like. And it\u2019s even worse, because these people aren\u2019t gleaning anything interesting from what they\u2019re doing beyond a boundary, meaning they can\u2019t even put a definite finger on anything. I\u2019d rather have a statistician bullshit me than an analysis mathematician. I&#039;d always thought mathematics was the peak of human reasoning, but with all of what I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019m finding it hard to believe. Even looking at the structure of crystallized reasoning and the most complex jobs, writing ability, particularly as a form of composing written arguments, rises far above mathematics. I also know /sci/ to be a particularly dumb board. I wanted to do mathematics, because it was the only form of knowledge which wasn\u2019t an empirical form of unintelligent parroting.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

Because complex numbers fill up a plane, and specific numbers are analogous to various rotations, they encode rotation information numerically.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

Firstly, it would not just affect objects that have passed through the portal, but would also effect objects on the other side. So, anything placed in front of the blue portal would be pushed away by this moving space. But, how far does this go. Does the portal push a column of space outwards towards infinity? Say instead of a cube you put a 10 mile rod through the portal? Does the spacial distortion travel the 10 miles of rod.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

Make that guy create his own stack implementation and rewrite his calculator to use it.<br><br>Teach prefix as a novelty/history lesson if you have extra time.<br><br>Now every student knows how to eliminate ambiguity in arithmetic, has written some code for their own calculator, and learned about stacks. The smarter kids also played more with translating infix to postfix and the smartest kids did that and made their own stacks.<br><br>You can combine intro math and intro computer science this way and students can see how math gets used by a computer and making a fairly powerful calculator in an easy OOP language like Java would be a good semester project that ties all the math together and gives it an immediately obvious practical application.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what&#039;s supposed to be hard about making these kinds of plans.

Earthquake lights (EQL) can occur in the atmosphere over earthquake epicenter areas and adjacent faults before and during quakes. They may look like diffuse airglow, flashes, fiery pillars, and luminous balls. EQL may cause a mystical experience probably due to the influence of their electromagnetic fields on the brain. Subjective perception and interpretation of EQL depend on religious and cultural traditions. We study a stereotype of EQL interpretation in the legends of the Greek Orthodoxy exemplified by the legends about the foundation of two shrines: St. George Monastery near the Cape Fiolent, Crimea and the Panagia Tripiti Church in Aigion, Peloponnese. It is argued that the similar interpretation of EQL observation in the Crimean and Peloponnesian legends were caused by similar natural and economic living conditions of the Greek population in the both regions in the Middle Ages. We also consider some examples of EQL observation took place in other regions and their interpretation in other denominations. Differences and relations between EQL of mechanoelectrical and degassing origin are discussed.

We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

In the context of &quot;The Last Question&quot; by Isaac Asimov, the question of how the net amount of entropy of the universe can be massively decreased is a central theme of the story. The story explores the idea that, through advanced technology and scientific understanding, it may be possible to reverse entropy and decrease the net amount of entropy in the universe. However, it is important to remember that these scenarios are purely fictional and should not be taken as promoting or endorsing any particular scientific viewpoint or course of action.", "filename": "image[1]", "ext": ".png", "w": 404, "h": 491, "tn_w": 205, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675832831210744, "time": 1675832831, "md5": "QhniGcfD2Hcj3+BNGL8jYg==", "fsize": 90533, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "someone-had-to-ask-right", "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 15186188, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)00:15:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15186173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15186173</a><br>ChatGPT threads are not welcome here.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative. Poor people lead an existence in perpetual captivity to their employers and hold no agency and such an existence is a lifelong experience of the hypothetical week posited.

This is stupid.<br>Not that guy, but if you buy 1000 tickets, that reduces that 15 mile high stack by 4 inches! It does not divide the probability. <br><br>1000 tickets is the width of 2 packets of 500 count copy paper, each about 2 inches, for a total of 4 inches per 1000 sheets. That makes for about 250 tickets per inch. Rounding down the odds to 250M, that would be a population of 250M unique tickets, where only one is the winner. That would be 1M inches of tickets to print them all up. Divide that by 63360 inches in a mile, that would be 15.7 miles of tickets. not 14.7 (Maybe he used thiner paper or maybe he use the real odds of closer to 300m).<br><br>Still, Buying more tickets doesn&#039;t divide the probability, it simply subtracts from the population. The number of tickets bought does not change the probability by division \u2014 if the probability of one ticket is 1 out 250M, the probability of 2 tickets is NOT 1 out of 125M.

By encouraging those close to them to vaccinate, people are both promoting compliance with social norms and increasing their own level of protection against the disease. Also, by judging those who do not vaccinate more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote cooperative behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like indirect reciprocity or partner choice, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prosocial outcomes.
