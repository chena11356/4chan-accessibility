I presented a small project I had done using PINNs for a toy CFD problem. The prof was impressed and encouraged me to apply. Also, he has good funding and some innovative ideas</span><br>Seems like a good choice from what you described. Take my words with a grain of salt though, I am only a phd student myself (3rd year)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only issue is that his lab is pretty new (currently 3 PhD students working under him and the lab was established in 2019-20)</span><br>That is sufficient for a small lab, I work for a lab/research group not much larger than this. Also, if he is innovative and has good funding lined up, it could be worthwhile. Also, younger professionals typically are more ambitious than well established profs because they still have to prove themselves, and are more hands-on too (but this may not necessarily be the case with everyone). In my opinion, having a mentor actually work with you/assist/advise you is more important than having a fancy name on the paperwork, even if that name can open more doors for you later on, but thats just my opinion. The newer professional will likely be able to help you develop actual skills/know-how but will not have the name recognition, while the more established professional will leave you on your own but will have better name recognition and connections.<br>Also, consider the time commitments, because face-to-face communications is very valuable - would you rather have someone who can meet with you 1-2 hours weekly or even more time per week, or someone who can give you 30 minutes max once in 2 weeks or a month?<br>Also, I cannot stress this enough - it really helps if you are on good terms with your advisor and like them as a person, than can make a big difference - do you like this guy?

Katayama (1996) based his reasoning on the similarities of skeletal size and proportions, especially those of the extremities, between the Polynesians and a large Japanese individual with gigantism (a deceased Sumo wrestler, \u2018Dewagatake\u2019, Suzuki et al., 1986). Enlargement of the extremities is known to be one of the common clinical features of gigantism and acromegaly (e.g. Fitzgerald, 1992). Katayama (1996) suggested that the excessively developed body of the Polynesians is produced by their elongated juvenile and adolescent growths. Although gigantism is caused by an endocrinological disorder, genetic modifications mimicking it could have produced adaptive physical characteristics, which would have been selected for during the micro-evolutionary history of the Polynesians. It is possible that the Polynesians\u2019 big feet, perhaps obtained by such growth mechanisms, would be adaptive in supporting their heavier bodies. The great RFL and RFB values (Table 2), the most distinctive features of their feet, indicate that the Tongans have long and wide feet even relative to their tall and heavy bodies.<br><br>Selection that occurred during such bottlenecks\u2014caused, for example, by the windy climate\u2014would be likely to favor the heavy body-build of the Polynesians.

Salt sensitivity is generally considered a hallmark of hypertension in blacks and is present in 73% of hypertensive blacks. This racial predilection has led to speculation that salt sensitivity is inherited. Our data suggest that the majority of the variation in the salt sensitivity of MAP and systolic BP may be due to additive genetic effects.</span><br>Heritability of Salt Sensitivity in Black Americans<br>https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/ful<wbr>l/10.1161/01.hyp.28.5.854", "time": 1668746223, "resto": 14993691}], "last_modified": 1668746223}]}]
