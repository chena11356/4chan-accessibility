The key factor is that the field is progressing at an exponential rate.&quot; <br><br>In the current fiscal year, the federal government budgeted about $900 million to advance the field of quantum information science, which includes quantum computing....<br><br>[S]everal local venture capital firms are getting comfortable with placing bets on the quantum computing sector. Glasswing&#039;s Rudina Seseri says that her firm is &quot;seeing momentum pick up,&quot; although the sector is &quot;still in the warm-up phase, not yet in the first inning.&quot; But some of the technology being developed by startups, she says, &quot;is so meaningful that if they get the technology to work at scale, they will be incredibly valuable.&quot;<br><br>That said, much of the revenue available to these companies today comes from researchers in academic and corporate labs trying to understand the potential of quantum computers. Sam Liss, an executive director in Harvard&#039;s Office of Technology Development, thinks that &quot;the large commercial opportunities for quantum are still a long way off.&quot; The OTD helps attract corporate funding to Harvard research labs, and also helps to license technologies created in those labs to the private sector. &quot;Technologies have a way of getting oversold and overhyped,&quot; Liss says. &quot;We all recognize that this is going to take some time.&quot;", "filename": "11a4d43afa9bc752", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1040, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 203, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669028487599459, "time": 1669028487, "md5": "pGUdZ+bsHjCu+X8lPdbfMw==", "fsize": 202159, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "quantum-computer-is-coming", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15003348, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)06:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15003321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15003321</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quantum computer</span><br>meme<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBL<wbr>VtCYHVO8", "time": 1669029000, "resto": 15003321}], "last_modified": 1669029000}, {"no": 14991073, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)04:48:04", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/mg/ -
