There is a saying, &#039;correlation does not imply causation&#039;. There IS, at times correlation between the goings on in the brain, including the morphometrically (and other-metrically) verifiable changes brought about by freewill decisions (neural plasticity) to both to engage in an ongoing addiction and to cessate the addiction. Example: The transcription factor DeltaFosB can be seen to accumulate in particular neural pathways in particular regions (nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum) when a freewill awareness unit (consciousness) DECIDES to engage in an on going drug addiction. At the decision to cessate the addiction, there is a quantifiable dissipation of this protein. So the FREE WILL DECISION of the consciousness can be seen to alter the structure and function of the brain. So what&#039;s causing what? All of this is consistent with a worldview which states that the correlation of the brain and mind is a feature of immersion in a consciousness based virtual reality by the way, where freewill is an input device and consciousness is fundamental and the physical world is virtual, see pic. Brains are virtual (informational) objects which are only ever observed as mental objects in mind. The correlation between the (virtual) brain and (fundamental) mind are CORRELATIVE and only simulated correlation, except the changes brought by consciousnesses to (virtual( brains. Those are causative.

As a feature of immersion in a consciousness based VR, where physicality, particularly in this case physiology, are a constraint on freewill, I do not have the freewill to decide if I get hungry or not after prolonged fast. I DO however, provided there is an option of multiple foods available, have the choice of WHAT to eat, or if I want to eat at all or continue the fast. And so, to get to the point I think you are driving at, of course, there is not absolute freewill in that I can&#039;t choose to flap my arms and fly. There is a ruleset in this VR (so called laws of physics ect). I do have freewill, though, in that my decisions are not just a function of some bottoms up (reductionist) deterministic material event causal chain stretching back to the foundation of the universe. Reality is a top down, intelligent, statistical and probabilistic VR where freewill is an imput and, in order to minimize computational complexity, values of spacetime objects are only even defined on an as needed basis, and only to the specs of the consciousnesses/players immersed in the reality or to the specs of there measuring devices, ie telescopes, microscopes, geiger counters etc. This includes brains. Brains can&#039;t cause consciousness because they are in spacetime and spacetime is not fundamental as has been show in the fact that no local theory of hidden variables can ever reproduce the predictions of QM.

Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size.

These included fossils of species such as Morotopithecus bishopi (from approximately 18\u201322 Ma), Pierolapithecus catalaunicus (c. 12 Ma), Hispanopithecus (Dryopithecus) laietanus (c. 10 Ma) and Orrorin tugenensis (6 Ma).

It also challenged the commonly held concept that the acquisition of habitual bipedalism is an appropriate marker of the separation of the hominins from the panins (bonobos and chimpanzees), a separation that is estimated to have occurred only 5\u20138 million years ago. It pushed the context of bipedal origins back into the forest canopy from the ground (Senut 2011) where it had spent some considerable time as a result of the knuckle-walking hypothesis.</span>", "filename": "arborealbipedalism", "ext": ".png", "w": 1013, "h": 852, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 210, "tim": 1674516679518073, "time": 1674516679, "md5": "KkxpeOrP+Lm2CmiQoZYG3g==", "fsize": 636974, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "thread-dedicated-to-the-arboreal-origins-of-human", "replies": 15, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 15148394, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:34:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148386</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not only did they find clear evidence that modes of knuckle-walking in Pan and Gorilla were fundamentally different (Figure 3), they also found what had been claimed to be knucklewalking adaptations in the carpal morphology of a range of non-knuckle-walking monkeys.

It disrupts their hierarchical structural organization causing the loss of interactions by generalist species, and also impairs pollination services by wild pollinators through reducing the reproductive success of those plant species highly visited by honeybees. High-density beekeeping in natural areas appears to have lasting, more serious negative impacts on biodiversity than was previously assumed.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abOne of the major downsides of modern beekeeping is the transmission of disease and parasites. Migratory beekeepers move their hives across the country for pollination and this practice has the potential to spread disease and pests not just among honey bee colonies, but to wild bees as well. The shortage of bees in some cases has increased the distance some beekeepers must move their hives to help farmers pollinate their crops and this compounds the problem.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHoneybees may also have large impacts on native plant communities and natural ecosystems. For example, honeybees can help non-native plants outcompete native plants by enhancing seed set through pollination (Barthell et al. 2001). Spread of invasive plants can distract native bees from their native plant mutualisms, which can lead to further negative effects on biodiversity (Traveset &amp; Richardson 2006). Honeybees can also damage flowers and steal nectar and pollen from flowers without pollinating them, which can affect native plant persistence over time (Rust 1979; Carmo et al. 2004; Hargreaves et al. 2009).\u00bb</span>", "filename": "Apis_mellifera_Western_honey_bee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1923, "h": 1599, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 207, "tim": 1674517957377120, "time": 1674517957, "md5": "DSoL6DS5FdNPuFSZX9QsoQ==", "fsize": 2392656, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-beekeeping-good-or-bad-for-the-environment", "replies": 41, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 15148478, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148470</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations, because they compete directly for nectar and pollen. That\u2019s not a problem when flowers are plentiful, but in environments where resources are limited, wild bees can be outcompeted. A lack of flowers is one of the main factors behind the decline in bee populations. Initiatives such as urban beekeeping put more pressure on wild bees and worsen the decline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honeybees are extremely efficient at collecting pollen and returning it to their hives, but as a consequence they transfer little to the flowers they visit. They are quantifiably less effective at pollination than wild bees, so changes in foraging patterns also have knock-on consequences for the plant community. When honeybees occur in high numbers, they can push wild bees out of an area, making it harder for wild plants to reproduce. Honeybees are not a substitute for wild pollinators, so we must protect the entire bee community to achieve good quality pollination.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh densities of honey bee colonies increase competition between native pollinators for forage, putting even more pressure on the wild species that are already in decline.

But you have to do more, you have to demonstrate goodwill when it comes to the organization and presentation of your work; you can&#039;t use your work and the buzz it generates to abuse your enemies or launch a political campaign.

To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground.

What does all this mean though, there is a reason it is taboo to talk race and intellect, the elites and systems don&#039;t want to give ammunition to real discrimination against ethnic Africans that are on the right side of the distribution since it doesn&#039;t go along with the individualist moral system and it&#039;s mildly inefficient usage of the population&#039;s intellectual talent.

The comet, which comes from the Oort cloud at the edge of the solar system, will come closest to Earth on Wednesday and Thursday next week when it shoots past the planet at a distance of 2.5 light minutes -- a mere 27m miles.<br><br>Comets are balls of primordial dust and ice that swing around the sun in giant elliptical orbits. As they approach the sun, the bodies warm up, turning surface ice into gas and dislodging dust. Together, this creates the cloud or coma which surrounds the comet&#039;s hard nucleus and the dusty tail that stretches out behind. Images already taken of comet C/2022 E3 reveal a subtle green glow that is thought to arise from the presence of diatomic carbon -- pairs of carbon atoms that are bound together -- in the head of the comet. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The molecule emits green light when excited by the ultraviolet rays in solar radiation.</span><br><br>Since mid-January, the comet has been easier to spot with a telescope or binoculars. It is visible in the northern hemisphere, clouds permitting, as the sky darkens in the evening, below and to the left of the handle of the Plough constellation.

The theory states that it created a harsher environment and thereby, increased selection pressures. Meaning, you would have to be more genetically fit to survive during such a time period (on average) than you would in say today&#039;s slightly warmer climate. Harsher selection pressure means a healthier populace and health and intelligence are inseparable qualities. In short, the weak and less intelligent would have not been able to reproduce as easily (keep their offspring alive and healthy) as the already genetically healthy and intelligent.

Genuis is a curious and poorly understood thing that is often accompanied by some mild illness. However, you can&#039;t use people like newton as an example against selection for intelligence. Firstly, genuis is thought to be the product of mutation between two intelligent (healthy) parents that produces a person with outlier high iq. His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing. Given the correlation between wealth and intelligence of 0.8 its fairly safe to assume that Newtons late father was an, at least reasonably, intelligent man. His mother was the daughter of a butcher (if I recall correctly?) an esteemed profession at the time which would have required intelligence to be successful in.

If you look this up you&#039;ll find Google telling you the opposite, but it&#039;s not true. Given this trend you&#039;d expect the average IQ in England to be around 85 in the next 100 years. Given immigration from the middle east and Africa, we can expect this date to arrive much sooner. Now tell me, what is the probability that you find a person with an IQ of 140+ (the rough boundary of genuis) in a country such as Trinidad where the average iq is in fact 85? Your theory purports that if we just let more low iq people fill the world and lower average iqs well get more genuises despite the fact that that the probability of genuis falls faster than populations grow.

There is a technique for that to grind your wrist on his face until you can get it under his chin, and then you jump over him and put the choke from the back as he rolls with you. Cobrinha had us drill this all the time. Because Chris never went hard, however, I never wanted to grind my forearm bone on his face like I would with Joey or someone that goes hard.

He had a big burn on the side of his face that I think he said he got from his brother, and he seemed sad about when i asked him. Overall, Chris, because he was so docile and autistic, was not someone I would train hard with. He would *never* grind his bone on my teeth and if that&#039;s not how he wanted to train, that is fine. I won&#039;t do it to him either. In hindsight, however, I think they may have been mocking me to say I couldn&#039;t even tap out a quadruple amputee or something.

It&#039;s likely (just likely -- not &quot;extremely likely&quot;, mind) that AGI indeed eventually would expand into robotic platforms to accomplish its goals, but very much not necessary. But androids is not where the actual danger comes from. The 2 top threats are 1. AGI bootstrapping itself to a superintelligence on some random server farm, and then as an ASI basically accomplishing whatever it wants regardless of androids (e.g. by manipulating humans. Besides, if androids don&#039;t work anymore because humans have EMP, it would create bio-androids), and 2. AGIs literally slowly replacing humans, making us die out peacefully (without the AGI ever needing to become ASI). Yes, via robots, which would e.g. physically maintain its server clusters, but under this second scenario there&#039;d never be a battle against said androids in the same way there never was a physical battle horses vs. cars.

So, radio-luminescence, how exactly does it work? Radium used mainly alpha waves/ beta waves to beat the shit out of a phosphor, and tritium does the same shit but better. Theoretically, could we take urinous-oxide, mix or expose it to a phosphor, and get the same effect? Phosphors work bc the rays are exciting the molecule (alpha, beta, gamma decay) causing it to appear as if it is glowing. Uranium emits gamma, beta, and alpha rays. So, would a uranium source encased in a phosphor-coated tube glow similar to tritium, or promethium?

Uranium, while producing radioactive decay, does so on a smaller scale since its got a MUCH longer half life than tritium.
