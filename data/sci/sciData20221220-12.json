The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases. Don&#039;t waste time chasing skirts. It&#039;s fun at the time, but you&#039;ll look back and realize it was mostly pointless. Hope this helps.

Since there is in the whole universe neither an intelligent force nor an eternal force (mankind, for all its yearnings, has yet to succeed in inventing a perpetual motion machine), we must assume that this force that is active within the atom comes from a conscious and intelligent mind.

Despite this nefarious scheming in the Vatican, there exists another sovereign order besides the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is called the Sovereign Magistral Order of the Temple of Solomon (the first king after David.) Based on the Isle of Man, these are the Templar knights with whom the pope broke faith about 700 years ago. The catholic pope has no sway over this order and I understand that they had long anticipated this gambit on the part of the master of the jesuits to try to cut the blood of David out of story of the of the Lord to be replaced with the uncircumsised gangsters that call themselves the catholic church today. If you look in the Bible, however, God&#039;s covenant was a covenant of blood but the people who control the Vatican today have none of that blood.<br><br>Pope dissolves Knights of Malta leadership, issues new constitution<br>https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/new<wbr>s/international/pope-dissolves-knig<wbr>hts-of-malta-leadership-issues-new-<wbr>constitution/", "filename": "TIMESAND___2Chron1019", "ext": ".png", "w": 834, "h": 348, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 52, "tim": 1670990429509709, "time": 1670990429, "md5": "AQ9VrCjds3IU5mG2VGDAkQ==", "fsize": 13285, "resto": 15037381}, {"no": 15052312, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:20:40", "name": "Jealous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15037614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More violence from Debra Bridegan, more theft by deception, more bragging about injuring me, more bragging about stripping me of promised and owed continued material disability support--more bragging about pretending that DB is &quot;authorized&quot; to lie to Miles and I while exploiting us violently, directly and indirectly.</span><br>This false allegation of authorization is relevant to my interests.

First energy taxes are raised. Power companies respond instantly by dropping all investments in improvements and new power, both hydroelectric and wind power. Also fish farming taxes are raised, based on expected earnings rather than real earnings, just because that is more convenient for ministry of finance. So fish farming companies respond immediately by freezing new investments, and there are also redundancies.

Read actively, paying attention to every word, and read cover to cover unless you&#039;re already familiar with the subject matter and are just checking out a different book from one you&#039;ve already read in detail.<br>3. Linear notes are too restrictive, and mind maps are mostly a meme that encourages time-sucking perfectionism. Instead, get cards on which you note down important techniques, theorems, etc. You can then easily rearrange the cards, scrap a card, replace a card with a better version, etc., and thereby avoid many of the headaches of linear notes. When you&#039;re finished with the book, wrap an elastic band around the cards and throw the stack into a &#039;knowledge box&#039;.

It&#039;s a matter of taste which problems to solve, and the availability of answer keys or solution manuals will often dictate your choice. Modern books often have an unnecessarily large number of exercises. You can go the OCD route of solving every problem, but this can kill all motivation if, for instance, you&#039;re not passionate about the book you&#039;re reading and are reading it purely to brush up before getting to what you&#039;re actually passionate about. You can go the odd- or even-numbered-only route, given that many books are designed so that you won&#039;t miss anything important if you do so. If you know your abilities without delusions, you can smash books fast by just reading the problems and skipping those you&#039;re sure you know how to solve.<br>5. It can help motivation to work through three or more books in parallel, and when you leave one book, try to leave it on a &#039;good note&#039; that makes you look forward to returning.

I have been looking into PINNs a lot recently and I struggle to see what&#039;s interesting with them. <br><br>Its a method to solve PDEs by incorporating the form of the PDE into the loss. There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression. This is more about using NNs to discover new governing laws or invariants from data. I find the idea very appealing, but it&#039;s very engineery and uninspired at this point.

It suggests to me, meth users and other drug users actually get a bang for their buck and dont have their entire next day ruined by severe hangovers (this was my case when i was 25 ). Alcohol is a piece of shit high, compareably to other drugs, it is at the bottom and for some reason the negatives exceedingly scale any positive effects(usually one hour).

If we can do calculus on this manifold, we can define the vector space of tangent vectors at a point in the manifold (tangent space at a point). With this tangent space, we can construct a co-space (think co-vectors); these co-vectors can be used to construct a higher dimensional analog to vectors (think areas and volumes as opposed to lines for vectors) called differential forms. The highest dimensional differential form is called the volume form of the manifold. Now, if you translate any right hand throughout your manifold and it stays right handed, the manifold is called orientable. You can define a measure (how you do integration) on your manifold with the volume form. <br><br>There are many other interesting points about this construction, but I hope that was understandable.", "time": 1671379282, "resto": 15052868}, {"no": 15062153, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:52:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15052868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15052868</a><br>Are there rabbits on the dark side of the moon?

I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

The brain scanner can scan someone\u2019s brain and download the position and structure of its neurons. This machine can then produce mock neurons made of silicon, other metals, and polymers, that are exactly the same as the neurons it has scanned. The machine can also do the same for other brain cells that are necessary for support and nutrient dispersal in the brain. They explain to you that they will first scan around fifty million of your brain cells, which is about zero point zero five percent of your total brain cells, and produce them. Next they will surgically remove fifty million of your identical brain cells and replace them with the new artificial ones. Finally they will patch up your head and send you home.

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

Just as in Mexico. States will give water priority to their largest cities (Reno, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Odgen, Phoenix, Yuma, Tuscon), counties will rate all their ZIP codes based on water network access, and individual towns will have to self-finance collective water delivery or force that cost onto individual homeowners.

Suburban tract developments will slowly rot away and be outright abandoned as water rationing is instituted and their taps are shut off before others. The &quot;shut off&quot; itself doesn&#039;t necesarily have to be permanent either - again using Mexico as an example, certain districts will have their water shut off seasonally to preserve it for larger urban districts. Others will have the equivalent of a &quot;brown out&quot; and use dirtier non-potable water, but by this point people will tolerate it to wash with. Individual homes will be rated on their water factor and single family detached housing will be very unfavorable to large apartment complexes and condos that have collective water delivery paid by tenants&#039; HOA fees.

To mitigate this risk a parallel path was implemented: 1) qualify the valves to<br>operate at -135C, and 2) develop thermal control capability to elevated temperatures in case<br>qualification efforts are unsuccessful. While qualification efforts are ongoing, it is expected<br>that the valves will be qualified to an operating temperature of -135C.

Water is frozen when its atoms arrange themselves in a lattice configuration. This happens because the thermal oscillations of the atoms are no longer sufficient at sub-zero temperatures to counteract the mutual repulsion of the negatively charged electrons of the H2O. These molecules constantly seek to maintain a maximal diffusive distance from one another. When electrons align, Coulomb forces are multiplied. As such, when water takes on a lattice configuration, the water can diffuse to a greater extent than otherwise possible if it were in a liquid state.<br><br>When water is above a certain temperature, individual molecules can move about randomly, breaking the ordered structure and rendering the overall body of molecules a liquid. Thus, two forms of motion; thermal motion and the Coulomb-enhanced diffusive motion are at odds with one another.<br><br>One of the key behaviors of freezing water that makes cryogenic preservation problematic is the expansion that occurs in the instant of the phase change. While it is generally true that liquids contract as their temperature decreases, the boundaries of phase changes of matter are an exception to this rule.<br><br>This brings us to the reason why room-temperature crystallization of water is the solution that will enable successful suspended animation. If it were possible to cause water to transition to a frozen state at room or body temperature or even higher temperatures, metabolic functions could be halted by bringing about a crystalline configuration of water within the body without any refrigeration or chemical injection.", "time": 1671511866, "resto": 15065853, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15065856, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:52:14", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "The key difference here is that since the water is at a comparatively high temperature to begin with; having not undergone the contraction associated with the drop from 36\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C; it would not expand harmfully when it enters the artificially-enhanced Coulomb-induced frozen state.<br><br>While Coulomb forces acting without the benefit of aligned electrons are understood to have the ability to extert force over a distance of about four atomic widths of hydrogen, when alignments exist, the field of influence can be expanded almost indefinitely. Crystals such as quartz have already been synthetically constructed in order to create these alignments to exert Coulomb force over great distances. If a sufficient number of these crystals could be aligned, force lines great enough to induce crystallization of water at high temperatures could be produced over an area large enough to &quot;hot freeze&quot; something the size of an adult human being.<br><br>Depending upon how large of a crystal would be needed to produce this effect, one of two primary approaches could be used. One would be a casket in which a crystalline lid is lowered onto the casket, sealing a person inside. If a thickness greater than a few feet is required, the entire wall of a building might be constructed out of the same type of crystal with the individual to be preserved being slid into position under the wall on a movable tray.<br><br>Since the freezing and thawing processes would, in theory, be instantaneous and would not result in the expansion of the frozen water, the person frozen should be able to arrive safely in the future in approximately the same state as when they entered the Coulomb field.<br><br>The Future Is Made in America<br>19Dec2022", "time": 1671511934, "resto": 15065853, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15063148, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)19:57:23", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "MULTIPLE ABIOGENESIS EVENTS", "com": "Were there multiple abiogenesis events on early Earth?

In the 1980s we learned that the scientist who discovered penicillin did so by feeding moldy bread to a dog with a severe infection. The story goes the dog in the lab was hungry and since he knew it was going to die didn&#039;t want to waste good food so tossed it some moldy bread. The dog at it and the infection went away. He realized it was the bread and that the mold was penicillin.<br><br>My kid is doing a history paper tonight and the now story is Alexander Fleming went on vacation but left a petri dish open on his desk.

The last few weeks I&#039;ve been thinking a fair bit of how to visualize 4D. I think I&#039;m getting closer. The picture in OPs example is a common one, but all they&#039;ve done is duplicate the cube and shift it a bit and it&#039;s hard to see what&#039;s going on. It makes sense though, because when going from 2D to 3D it&#039;s just a 2D plane shifting out to form a cube. If you were a person on that 2D plane and it started suddenly becoming 3D then I think it would look like everything is suddenly becoming wider in your vision. Going from 3D to 4D would be the same, everything becoming wider in your vision, but I think it&#039;s a lot easier to visualize as a 3D sphere becoming 4D. If you imagine a line from the center of a sphere to the surface, then imagine infinite lines from the centre of a sphere to the surface so it creates a solid sphere, and your head it&#039;s right at the middle of the sphere, then going from 3D to 4D would be like all those lines separating at the surface apart from one another, revealing volume between each line that wasn&#039;t there before, and that volume is the actual 4D space. I don&#039;t know of that makes sense, I&#039;d probably need to make an animation or something. Picrel is the best I could do to describe it I guess, so the spikes are the 3D space and the space between them is the 4D space, but in our 3D reality all the spikes are right up against eachother", "filename": "ball-toy-toys-balls-spike-spikes-spiked-rubber-close-macro-close-up-J8NCRE", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1300, "h": 1162, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 111, "tim": 1671362018286735, "time": 1671362018, "md5": "htSzTII29agu0fXg8Bya4Q==", "fsize": 148338, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061650, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reality is only 3-dimensional because that&#039;s all my brain can experience!</span><br>lol", "time": 1671364923, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061871, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15061650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15061650</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s beyond human comprehension!</span><br>Literal theological argument.", "time": 1671372801, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061888, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:25:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15060620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15060620</a><br>https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gend<wbr>er_Field_theory", "time": 1671373544, "resto": 15060603}, {"no": 15061892, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)09:27:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15061888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15061888</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This theory is a combination of the dimensional models (A Single Continuum, 2D Graph Theory, and the N-dimensional gender space) with Gender set theory and scalar fields defined in mathematics.

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

I actually spoke to the guy who put this line in the article, and he agreed with my assessment that Ted&#039;s work is mostly aligned with general analysis / topology.

Turns out you can derive most of the other identities needed for calculus from that one. Like if you want the formula for sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) then subtract the cosine part from both sides. Similarly, try dividing through by cos^2(x) and you see that you get tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x). similarly if you divide through by sin^2(x) you get 1+cot^2(x) = csc^2(x).<br><br>Now you wont need much more than that regarding trig identities.

And then use even and oddness of cos and sin to add/subtract multiplies of pi radians to those basic angles, and figure out how to fill in the rest of the unit circle.<br><br>You only need to do this stuff to a basic degree so that you can evaluate limits, derivatives, and integrals. you dont need the stuff to actually &quot;do calculus&quot;", "time": 1671385535, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15062457, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)14:38:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15059042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15059042</a><br>I think using some youtube lectures would be a good alternative if you have less time and just solve some IMPORTANT problems in the books after you watch a lecture of particular topic", "time": 1671392287, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15062461, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)14:39:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15059042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15059042</a><br>https://youtube.com/playlist?list=P<wbr>LDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP<br>Learn from here (professor Leonard)<br>Enjoy anon", "time": 1671392395, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15064287, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)09:36:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15060421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15060421</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;fuck having to learn useless math</span><br>they ask students to do difficult and completely useless tasks to identify which ones are servile idiots ready for a life of being an exploited loser in a cubicle, it works surprisingly well", "time": 1671460580, "resto": 15059042}, {"no": 15064301, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)09:45:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "might help to spend a few days brushing up on your basic algebraic manipulation skills involving the distributive, associative and commutative properties.
