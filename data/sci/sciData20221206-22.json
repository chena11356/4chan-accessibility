I need advice to create a clean room where the purpose is to filter the following: CO2, CO, and VOC emissions from said room, which is surrounded by a heavy amount of environmental pollution, leading to decreased air quality. Resources can be found at stores like Lowes, with the ability to use online ordering. This means no access to regulated chemicals, materials, or metals.

While basal cells have been provably linked to UV-related carcinomas, the assumption that mole (neval) cells become cancerous due to UV exposure is likely false. Conversely, chemicals that come into contact with moles are more likely the cause of most cancers of mole cells. The application of sunblock containing carcinogenic substances such as titanium dioxide and exposure of moles to other chemicals is a far more likely cause of mutations to neval cells given their tendency to attempt dupliction of any chemical that comes in contact with the cells. Unlike most cells, which attempt to restrict entry by harmful chemicals in order to maintain integrity, neval cells permit entry of all chemicals in order to attempt replication. If the chemical cannot be duplicated, the neval cell will self-duplicate (leading to irregular shape but not necessarily cancer.)
