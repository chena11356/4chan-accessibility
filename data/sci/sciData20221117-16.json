Many people in stem fields place an enormous value on intelligence and evaluate their own worth based on it. The idea that they may not be particularly exceptional in this regard is deeply troubling for them, and so they&#039;ll protect their ego by posting threads bashing midwits to distance themselves from mediocrity and uphold the illusion that they&#039;re above it all.

But they have a different kind of insecurity. Sometimes they&#039;ll be compensating for other perceived shortcomings in themselves, and use their intelligence as an excuse for deficits in other areas. You may have noticed this behavior in very attractive people for example, who can become obsessed with their image and overtime develop various degrees of body dysmorphia as they myopically focus on their appearance and believe it to be the root of their unhappiness, when they might very well still be widely regarded as attractive people and the actual things making them unhappy are unrelated to it.<br><br>This kind of person is somewhat rare overall and this board is not an exception to that, but the presence of intelligent people compensating this way will cause the former, much more common types to feel a need to defend themselves, and so these threads will go on forever aimlessly.
