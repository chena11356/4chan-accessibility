But their shape means they typically want to weathervane into the wind. This diminishes your control when going with the wind, but gives you a boost in ground speed. Against the wind you can be slowed to a crawl or worse.

I study Computational Maidposting. Last time I posted my research here it was Wolfy MaidSearch and I got all boards banned for three days and my post got jannied off Warosu. I think this happened because a zoomer janny didn&#039;t know what a REPL is.<br><br>Today I have a useful application of Computational Maidposting in a new Computer Experiment called Kurumi MaidCard. Kurumi MaidCard is a Computer Program which can store compressed text in a Maid Address, and read that text back out of the Maid Address. I named it after Kurumi the vampire maid from Touhou because she came in my threads and helped me with math a lot of times and told me books. Thank you Kurumi, for telling me math ideas.<br><br>To get Kurumi MaidCard you need Java 18. Then you need to save MiniMaid.java (case sensitive).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get MiniMaid</span><br>https://pastebin.com/6ChEa6xS<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get Kurumi MaidCard</span><br>Save the attached image in the same directory you put MiniMaid in, then open a terminal and type<br><br>java MiniMaid.java file.png<br><br>with &quot;file.png&quot; replaced with whatever you saved the Maid Card as. MiniMaid will extract the full version of Kurumi MaidCard, along with the README, assuming that 4Chan doesn&#039;t mess with the pixels of images uploaded to it. The README explains Maid-LZW and how to use the Kurumi MaidCard REPL to make your own Maid Cards.<br><br>I plan to use Kurumi MaidCard to distribute all my Computer Experiments. The next one will be the Ilulu Number Calculator/SLAM. This should break my dependence on Pastebin, and let me distribute multi-file Computer Programs so the architecture can be saner and nicer without using GitHub.

At this point Kurumi MaidCard would draw it in a square (unless you told it to do something else). I propose instead to construct a new dictionary of 4 by 4 Maid Symbols.

Try to shapeshift into the other gender and or an animal. </span><br>It sounds bizarre, but I have a very limited control over my body or environs. I can fly (that&#039;s about it), but I essentially can&#039;t shapeshift. Cracking the latter has been my project for years (I don&#039;t actively try to lucid dream). The farthest I have gotten is one time slowly literally &quot;moulding&quot; my body shape into a different lumpy shape. Like, I first deformed my waist until my body became a literal hourglass shape, then stretched my shoulder/neck area upwards giving me a vaguely melted silhouette. I looked like something straight out of an Aphex Twin music video or Silent Hill game (except my skin and everything else beside the body shape remained normal looking). To get the ambiance right: it was in a very dim room, with the near-omnipresent mirror on one wall of course.<br><br>As I was stretching myself upwards, I headbutted the ceiling, and couldn&#039;t go farther. My brain just didn&#039;t let me crack through that wall. I assume the logic &quot;bodily movement is forceful enough to tear down walls&quot; isn&#039;t recognized by it, so it can&#039;t handle it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Jump into a painting, preferably of a surrealistic and impressionistic style.</span><br>Interesting. I have never seen one. But a couple times at least I could query my brain to paint images on demand, which is rather trippy as these human-level intellect feats happen completely outside my conscious awareness. Theb rain without consciousness is a bio-computer indeed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Create a copy of yourself, but stay on contact with it through telepathy, basically keeping a meta-personality.</span><br>Never tried that, will attempt to next time.

It&#039;s like you can see the post-production of the brain. <br><br>So you want basically, to lead with your strengths into the creation and the scenery will follow. For example, a moonlit night in the forest, I would start with the sounds, as in the subtle movement of the leaves, some owl cry, a wolf howl and some musical impressions also help to solidify the environment. <br><br>For the transformation of body, I couldn&#039;t make out how you enter the process, consciously, but your mirror aspect hints to mostly visualization? <br><br>When I transform, I partly do that im visualization, but more I just &#039;do&#039; it, as in starting to be the wolf, feeling that i am a wolf. I literally get down on all my four limbs and start running, chattering teeth, smelling the ground etc and the overall landscape/scenery catches up. (Losely Luke the difference of thinking about moving a finger and actually using the nerves.)<br><br> I also fly easier because I just feel as some birdish thing, then observe my human body float.

You actually training just to balance out, based on different stimuli than your visual input, but while you train that you can tell yourself, I train to control my buddy, who&#039;s will help me in my dream to control my form. There&#039;s no real connection, but you tell it yourself as you would believe it.

Here, he was placed under the tutelage of Patrick Blackett, an experimental physicist later made famous for his work on cosmic rays and paleomagnetism. This was not a successful pairing; due to his own ineptitude in the laboratory, Oppenheimer became envious of Blackett\u2019s skills as an experimental physicist. Indeed, Oppenheimer initially wished to study experimental physics, but was prevented from doing so because of his \u201cclumsiness\u201d in the lab.<br><br>In 1926, in a fit of psychological despair while on vacation in Corsica, Oppenheimer confessed to his two accompanying friends that he had to return to Cambridge immediately. The reason? Before he had left for vacation, he had coated an apple in noxious laboratory chemicals and placed it on Blackett\u2019s desk. Oppenheimer wanted to make sure that Blackett was alright.<br><br>Fortunately, he was. Unfortunately, the university\u2019s administration had been informed of his little \u201cprank\u201d and intended to press charges, because prestigious institutions like Cambridge usually look down on students murdering the faculty. It was only through the intervention of his parents that Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t charged; indeed, he was placed on academic probation and ordered to undergo regular psychiatric evaluations. Finally, at the end of 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge at the invitation of Max Born to study theoretical physics at the University of Gottingen.&quot;<br><br>He was a devoted Communist who formed cabals with other Jews, and a lying rat who seemed to lie about anything and everything including seemingly framing goys as spies to remove them from the project, which he of course was joined on by no other than king fraud himself Einstein.", "time": 1673288660, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15111394, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:25:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15110000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15110000</a><br><br>Every goy intellectual like newton, tesla etc. all have the same personality type where they are very reserved, quiet and just want to do their work.

As you may recall, in that configuration, the valence electron of a single lithium atom is held in a fixed position by a combination of nickel and copper. The Coulomb Force Lines generated by the cuprate are used to restrict the range of positions that the lithium&#039;s two sub-valence electrons may occupy.

This would ordinarily be corruptive since it would cause electrons to divert toward the edge of the wire and to be dumped into the silicon insulation. Instead, since these electrons are met by a barrier consisting of a MFS electron, the electrons are yanked first toward the edge of the wire and then jerked back on path in a single maneuver.

Dunno about shitty countries but in Scandinavia it doesn&#039;t seem like it. I think the main reason for your impression is that contrarians and retards are more entertaining and thus make the news and algorithms in disproportionate numbers. From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

ML is an insanely competitive field that values experimental progress over science and explainability. There is a constant race to develop novel, competitive techniques, which pushes a lot of research dollars. On the other hand, actually researching ML is an afterthought. People want to engineer systems that converge to (reasonable) answers faster and with fewer resources while running.

The awareness itself is not a algo and non-physical and not a creation of computation. The CONTENT of the of the consciousness, ie the physical datastream that the freewill awareness unit (consciousness) interfaces with is a computed/informational/numerical/vi<wbr>rtual reality. It&#039;s a computed reality that includes consciousness as an input device I might add. So it&#039;s not a situation of pre-determination on what will happen. Though the majority of macro objects with relative low uncertainty such as planets&#039; orbits are EFFECTIVELY (from the view point of the observer) deterministic. It&#039;s an probabilistically evolving simulation from initial conditions of data objects (matter) and rules on how they interact (physics &#039;laws&#039;). And, by the way, the system can be updated between planck refresh rate. To the renderer, the &#039;time&#039; between refresh is not physical. This is why you can mimic some of the content of consciousness, but never create it, ie, never create a a free will awareness unit. The only way computers might ever be conscious is if a free will awareness unit is either assigned to a non-bio-computer to use as an avatar, or a freewill awareness unit CHOOSES to use one. OR, there might be a constraint that says there can only be bio/metabolizing avatars. We (those of of consciousnesses immersed in the system of physicality) don&#039;t remember pre-existence and the avatar choosing/assigning process, at least I don&#039;t. The info data base is out there to query to find out, but I myself can&#039;t so far. Others claim to have accessed this info.

The example with two accelerating twins shows why acceleration is merely a prop, however necessary, in the thought experiment. The two twins have the same acceleration profile, yet one is affected more -- the one who travelled farthest, or for the longest time.<br>And indeed, acceleration on its own doesn&#039;t even figure in the calculation of proper time, how could it ever matter?<br>In fact, longer acceleration times for the same overall travel time *hurt* the effect, by shortening the time spent in the reference frames at max speed, and the effect is strongest when the acceleration time is minimized, because the time spent in those frames is maximized.<br><br>Also note that I don&#039;t want to &quot;unbend&quot; the triangle. Maybe this is the point you&#039;re getting hung up with.<br>There are three inertial reference frames at play that have a certain relationship between them that is independent of any acceleration, as the example with three observers (one per reference frame) shows.<br>If the travelling twin takes his entire journey, bent legs and all, as a rest frame, then he is wrong. Acceleration is absolute in SR, so he may only take either half of his trip as the rest frame. Once he accelerates out of it, or before he decelerates into it depending on his choice, he has to consider himself to be moving. But the acceleration is inessential to the problem, only the relationship between the three inertial reference frames is.<br>You may call this &quot;semantics,&quot; what I call semantics is doing this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also note that in this setup with a third observer that appears on the middle vertex you can never answer the question of whether the Earth or the spaceship is older because they never return to the same point.</span>", "time": 1673521418, "resto": 15110742}, {"no": 15119376, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)17:49:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15118119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15118119</a><br>Keep studying.

In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side.

He doesn&#039;t properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.<br>I just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as &quot;only eating meat&quot; which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.<br>In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because &quot;nobody wants it.&quot; Really? That&#039;s his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don&#039;t want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.", "filename": "Bill+nye+saves+nothing+i+was+expecting+more_6ee47a_6481043", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673289123181194, "time": 1673289123, "md5": "Dxz4V4HkKckp+FliQMyuJQ==", "fsize": 141755, "resto": 15089892}, {"no": 15111409, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)13:33:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn&#039;t reduce the acidity level of a solution.

Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don&#039;t know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn&#039;t change the pH level of an acidic solution.
