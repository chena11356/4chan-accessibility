If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world).

It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration.

The computation do of which this physical universe is an output of would by definition be outside of the virtual spacetime and non-physical from the point of view of those players immersed in/logged onto the reality. All computation done in the physical world worlds also be done by by this none physical computer. The computation seemingly done by devices constructed by players immersed in the reality, ie physical computers, would in fact not be doing any computation at all.

At no time though is the computation coming from inside physicality though. The system rendering physicality only simulates the situation AS IF the computation is coming from inside physicality, ie all physical causation is simulated causation. If the players immersed in the reality eventually advance to the point of figuring out how to induce from the system ultimately rendering physicality the apparent computation of computation such as done by our computers, then the renderer will duly render the physical EFFECTS of this computation.

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

These platforms are immensely popular and are to a laughably minor extent regulated and audited by impartial sources. Laying down the precedent this decade will save us a lot of headache in the the future. Also it will force legislation governing intercorporate compatibility and functionality accountability. Currently our governments are behind the curve and more or less operate on a general basic consumer rights level. Money back, replacement product, sub 10 year support guarantees etc... That shit cannot fly when technological devices become as indispensable and irreplaceable as basic utilities and civil protection services. We&#039;re already seeing this to some degree with electronic currency exchanges on a consumer level and digital citizens services (in many countries, applying for licenses, permits, healthcare information and insurance is already overwhelmingly a self-serve digital process). These technologies are on the way to becoming protected and strictly legislated utilities - even when the service is provided by private companies. This is in many ways a disadvantage to the corporate providers. They have to expend more capital to fulfill requirements mandated by law. An analogue can be seen in the power grid suppliers.

Though, that would certainly be an incredible accomplishment from scientific perspective I strongly believe that the only truly unassailable and inviolable freedom that all humans possess is the freedom of thought. Putting it the way you do is to me an even more demented version of teaching a child love and physical intimacy by savagely molesting and abusing it.<br><br>What I&#039;m talking about, purely conveying information is no more invasive or mind altering than reading a poem or touching sandpaper. The challenge is actually -defining- the language of this method of communication. <br>It&#039;s a circular problem in nature. You need to have a way to convey some kind of information in order to convey a shared language in the first place.<br>Which is why thoughts and emotions have been out of the scope so far. Conveying the meanings of a verbal language is aided by gestures and examples. Say sound -&gt;point to green object -&gt;repeat sound -&gt;point towards a second object that only share the characteristics of being green. <br><br>As you mention early versions of a chip like this would be limited to very basic electric signalling No. What the starting point would be is analogues to something like Euclid&#039;s elements.

Like Euclid&#039;s work it&#039;ll probably only be a simplified definition but it&#039;ll work for now. <br>I think the emotions that are best suited as our reference points are the most ingrained primal ones we have.

With children now getting these infections from vaccinated adults rather than from other children, the infectious dose they receive will tend to be higher.

I have come up with the following after reading a bit about the problem of whether there is any way to reduce the computational time for solving a Steiner Tree Problem without introducing any risk of error. I understand that many have already developed so-called approximation algorithms, which was going to be my suggestion if someone had not already done this. It occurred to me that Steiner Tree Optimization has application for A.I. in addition to some of their more mundane uses such as planning efficient routes. The following is a Steiner Tree Approximation approach that as closely as possible mimics human neural function.<br><br>The long method for computing the most efficient route from A to B, where each line segment is assigned a &quot;cost&quot; value, is to test every possible combination of line segments to find the lowest value. In complex systems consisting of thousands or perhaps millions of line segments, one can only hope to arrive at pathways that are approximate to the most efficient path. There may even be a benefit to occasionally taking a less efficient path. In cognition, uncoventional neurologies often give rise to unique and valuable ideas. This has implications for A.I. For route planning, it is to everyone&#039;s mutual benefit when all drivers do not take the allegedly most efficient path. Google Maps, for instance, often has to use coin flips to decide whether to send a specific driver down one of two equally viable routes.", "filename": "Screenshot_20221226-181018~2", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 640, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 222, "tim": 1672103321900895, "time": 1672103321, "md5": "GHKNITEF8x/wpGSBLuj7Hw==", "fsize": 90882, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-wouldnt-patent-the-sun", "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT", "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 15079991, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)20:09:42", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "If every driver were sent down the same path, the effect would be the reduction of the efficiency of that path.

This has implications for cognition in addition to routing automobile traffic.<br><br>For example, since we know that given parts of the brain perform multiple functions, one might think it potentially useful to avoid using the brain for other purposes as it might distract that part of the mind. Counterintuitively, recent studies have found that where there is overlap in brain regions in terms of function, engaging in other functions that activate that same brain region actually stimulate cognition rather than posing a distraction. This may be due to the fact that new formulating new ideas requires a shifting in the physical parts of the brain utilized and not a endless repetition of the same processing steps. Alternating between activities that utilize the same brain regions forces alternative axon activations.<br><br>When most people eat an entre\u00e9 with two sides, they take a few bites of each food item and rotate between the food items rather than eating say, all of the chicken, then all of the rice, then all of the green beans. Varying sensory inputs allows for the greatest enjoyment to be reaped from any experience as changing inputs has the effect of resensitizing a person to each input type. For the same reason, focus on a single cognitive task for extended periods leads to inefficient function while adding variety in the form of pacing or gesticulating while cogitating acts as a cognitive multiplier. A person employing such a cognitive strategy would be, to a certain extent, seeing problems with new eyes from one moment to the next.", "time": 1672103382, "resto": 15079986, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15079995, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)20:10:47", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "That said, establishing efficient artificial neural networks that still allow for variation in approach is essential if human cognition is to be duplicated within a machine.<br><br>The first step in my strategy for generating approximated solutions to Steiner Tree Problems is actually to first approximate the Least Efficient Pathway.

Furthermore, having two pathways that are less efficient than ideal but equally efficient to one another guarantees the continued use of both pathways. If a human brain has established two pathways and one is less efficient than the other, the less efficient pathway will fall into disuse and overall cognitive capacity will decline.

Neuromorphic processors as well as artificial neural networks both benefit from cognitive diversity in a manner similar to human neural pathways. It should be noted that cognition is most efficient when alternate pathways, even when they lead to the same destination, while both independently efficient, do not share in common convolutional patterns in common at any point in the pathway. This may explain why cognition in the human brain is supported by astrocytes which lead to a common point (the axon) and why each arm of an astrocyte is roughly identical in length but randomized in terms of the patterns of left, right, up, and down twists. A wider variety of convolutional twists in astrocytes as well as greater numbers of arms on astrocytes generally produces superior cognitive capacity. In some cases, it should be noted, the presence of an excessice number of arms on a single astrocyte can diminish cognitive capacity.

This may even be preferable where there is a desire to create redundancy and not to put too many eggs in a single proverbial basket. When planning for future expansion of road systems of any sort, when the nature of the future change is unknown, the most efficient choice is not to overcommit to any one direction.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

Here, he was placed under the tutelage of Patrick Blackett, an experimental physicist later made famous for his work on cosmic rays and paleomagnetism. This was not a successful pairing; due to his own ineptitude in the laboratory, Oppenheimer became envious of Blackett\u2019s skills as an experimental physicist.

It was only through the intervention of his parents that Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t charged; indeed, he was placed on academic probation and ordered to undergo regular psychiatric evaluations.
