Again looking at the bottom row, notice that the black circle in the bottom left of the bottom left panel is covering up a spot where a white circle can go. the only way to cover every unused position for the white circles while keeping the black circle in the same place as every other panel not on the bottom left -&gt; top right diagonal is option A, so A is correct.", "time": 1668540735, "resto": 14983432, "trip": "!!9odRrjwHLlO"}, {"no": 14986414, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:37:59", "name": "shmalculus", "com": "<a href=\"#p14986118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14986118</a><br><a href=\"#p14986119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14986119</a><br><a href=\"#p14986125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14986125</a><br><a href=\"#p14986233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14986233</a><br><a href=\"#p14986328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14986328</a><br>continuing from the last reply..<br><br><a href=\"#p14983473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14983473</a><br>this one really isn&#039;t so bad either, but i did spend a couple seconds longer on it than the other ones. first, separate the outer triangles from the inner ones in your head for clarity. now, pick any outer triangle, and notice how there&#039;s an inner triangle directly adjacent to it. move one triangle clockwise around the inner hexagon. see how the shape in that triangle is one half of the shape in the outer triangle, just rotated a quarter turn? to see which way the quarter turn goes, select the right (a similar argument exists picking left, but lets just do the right) half of trapezoid in the bottom left outer triangle. see how moving to the adjacent inner triangle and then around clockwise one more inner triangle shows that shape that looks sorta like the US state of Indiana? that&#039;s the right half of the trapazoid rotated a quarter turn clockwise. Now, if every outer triangle corresponds to an inner triangle that contains one half of the outer&#039;s shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then lets check out the bottom-left inner triangle and rotate that shape 90 degrees counter clockwise (should look like a backwards L), and then reflect it to recover the original shape.

In the second puzzle, I did that and it sorta jumped out at me that the black circles were in very regular positions and that there weren&#039;t any gaps after overlaying, so I only spent time figuring out that the black circles were covering up the white ones occasionally. for the last one, i thought that the half ellipse in the center-top-right triangle was an odd shape to include, and then noticed that all the inner triangles contained half of one of the outer triangles. Since they&#039;re all offset by the same amount, I rotated entire inner hexagon one tick counter-clockwise so that the pairings were clear, and then spent a moment looking for the trapezoid shape because it was the only one that could break the symmetry to show which way the halves were being rotated. Then another couple seconds to undo the rotation for the half of the missing answer and reflect it to decide that it had to be the middle option. again, apologies for coming off as snarky, but Im also very confident that IQ tests and puzzles like these only test for a very narrow kind of &quot;intelligence,&quot; which really I think is just more like visualizing and moving stuff around without having to do it on paper or something. I would expect that anyone in this thread would be able to find these answers if they had a physical model in front of them to move stuff around on without much time, but again compensating for the extra time lost to physically moving objects around makes it a little bit unfair if you&#039;re just trying to test how good someone&#039;s problem solving skills are. generally I place a lot more value on higher math stuff when it comes to intelligence, but my experience is limited since im still in undergrad and see mathgen stuff I dont get lots.", "filename": "IMG_0757", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 700, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668543415959817, "time": 1668543415, "md5": "JvgI+ylJZve1Qn/SvIjcHA==", "fsize": 49982, "resto": 14983432, "trip": "!!9odRrjwHLlO"}], "last_modified": 1668543415}, {"no": 14978153, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)22:59:48", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "G\u00f6bekli Tepe", "com": "Turns out our supposent metaphoric apes of ancestors are building these things 4k before when civs are suppose to start.<br>It&#039;s like telling people kids in that building are kindergardners who can&#039;t count their fingers when it turns out they are bunch of undergrads doing premed.<br>Are archies pseuds who actually have no idea what they are saying?", "filename": "9500 BCE", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 1054, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668225588107741, "time": 1668225588, "md5": "KcVJ8mjh2cvIBd2pK229dA==", "fsize": 1893058, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "gbekli-tepe", "replies": 82, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 77, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 14986384, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:25:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14985569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14985569</a><br>The foundation stones are minimum 350 tons, and the Trilithon stones are all almost 1000 tons each.

If you could replace all your cells with a synthetic counterpart that has the same function, you would still be you. It doesn&#039;t matter if the process is fast or slow. (You could achieve a form of immortality that way if you think about it.)<br><br>An example I could think of is that we are the &quot;4&quot; in 2 + 2, but we are not the 2 + 2, we are only the result of 2 + 2; you can also do 3 + 1 or 8 - 4 or any other combination that results in 4, you will still be you. Also, there is no way for you to be perfectly cloned; the moment there are two &quot;yous,&quot; a change occurs, and the clone is no longer &quot;you&quot; but &quot;himself.&quot; In order for a clone to be a perfect you, the clone and you would have to occupy the same space at the same time.<br><br>It also means that if the universe has a form of infinity or something like that, when the arrangements result in a &quot;4&quot;, you will be born again, without memories, of course; that&#039;s premium only.", "time": 1668532905, "resto": 14983693}, {"no": 14986152, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)12:22:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14983693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14983693</a><br>Define life.

Tooker<br>https://vixra.org/abs/2206.0152<br>http://gg762.net/papers.html<br>The purpose is to review and lay out a plan for future inquiry pertaining to the modified cosmological model (MCM) and its overarching research program. The material is modularized as a catalog of open questions that seem likely to support productive research work. The main focus is quantum theory but the material spans a breadth of physics and mathematics. Cosmology is heavily weighted and some Millennium Prize problems are included. A comprehensive introduction contains a survey of falsifiable MCM predictions and associated experimental results. Listed problems include original ideas deserving further study as well as investigations of others&#039; work when it may be germane. A longstanding and important conceptual hurdle in the approach to MCM quantum gravity is resolved. A new elliptic curve application is presented. With several exceptions, the presentation is high-level and qualitative. Formal analyses are mostly relegated to the future work which is the topic of this book. Sufficient technical context is given that third parties might independently undertake the suggested work units.", "filename": "TIMESAND___66_Intro_C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2550, "h": 9900, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668409504186572, "time": 1668409504, "md5": "wyAQaYjWucL8eu3tjwyerg==", "fsize": 3200545, "resto": 14973712}, {"no": 14982871, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)02:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14982855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14982855</a><br>Proof that only schizos believe in all these particles.", "time": 1668410250, "resto": 14973712}, {"no": 14982876, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)02:26:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14982856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14982856</a><br>But it less retarded than the standard model, anon.", "time": 1668410775, "resto": 14973712}, {"no": 14985129, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)23:08:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p14976063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14976063</a><br><a href=\"#p14976069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14976069</a><br><a href=\"#p14976050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14976050</a><br>Excuse me this is based.", "time": 1668485310, "resto": 14973712}, {"no": 14985819, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)07:51:14", "name": "Jealous", "com": "I grant your request for excusal.
