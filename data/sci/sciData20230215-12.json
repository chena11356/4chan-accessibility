You are presupposing that determined materialist event causation is the only form of causation.

So there is still a determination of events, it&#039;s just that AGENT causation is a variable instead. Reality is STATISTICAL and PROBABILISTIC fundamentally by the way. The things like the orbits of the planets with low uncertainty are are EFFECTIVELY deterministic since the probability distribution is as such that every cycle update the the random draw for an input will dictate that the planets stay on the course which is predictable to a high amout of decimal places but there is STILL some non-zero chance that a planet could tunnel from one side of the universe to the next, just as with quantum tunneling.

In 1975 Collins voiced to Maynard Smith the view that natural selection could not drive evolution because it always acted to reduce variation in favour of an optimum type for any environment, whereas the central story of evolution was that of increasing variation and complexity. Collins quoted Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (&quot;... unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.&quot;), and argued that if variation must always occur before natural selection can act, then variation, and not natural selection, drives evolution. He asked Maynard Smith whether he could search for a &quot;strong&quot; theory of variation. Maynard Smith warned Collins that he could not support his efforts to pursue a rival theory to the theory that natural selection drives evolution. Collins replied that he thought the object of science was to question and examine everything, including hallowed theories such as the theory of natural selection. Maynard Smith asserted that, on the contrary, the strength of science was its capacity to agree on certain principles, and act collectively to pursue agreed aims. This difference of view with his tutor made Collins give up his scientific career and pursue other interests instead.</span><br>the darwinian theory is protected from all criticism by it&#039;s keepers, it is held beyond the reach of anyone who might take a pass at discrediting it. how fragile it must be to need that protection", "time": 1676236440, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197823, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:14:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197813</a><br>Look up Gregor Mendel, you retard.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?</span>", "time": 1676236451, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197832, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197823</a><br>How do you know Gregor Mendel was real?", "time": 1676236640, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197841, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:19:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197832</a><br>How do you know he wasn&#039;t?", "time": 1676236751, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197848, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:21:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197841</a><br>I don&#039;t", "time": 1676236868, "resto": 15197746}, {"no": 15197863, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197761</a><br>That&#039;s only microevolution.

Then the RNA in triplets is translated to proteins based on shape as recognised by the 20 tRNA molecules and sqeezed together by the ribosomes. The chain of amino acyds are folded based on hydrofobic nature and is kept in shape by that and sulfide bridges of cysteins. Proteins then preform the houseceeping functions of the cells as well as making any secretions, extracellular matrix componetns, determine cell shape, cell-cell interactions etc. Cell diffferentiation is determined by differing concentration gradients of secreted transcription factors such as the hox genes.

Anything from insertions, deletions, and various mechanisms of pointmutation, to partial or full gene duplications, genomic region duplications, chromosome region duplications, recombinations, mRNA insertions, etc...<br>These are mechanisms we can clearly and easely observe, and they are mechnaisms which are logical, necesseary consequences of just physics, and chemistry. <br>That is what i meant that entire fields would have to be wrong.

For example, there could be small amounts of food residue or spilled liquids on the inside of the bin, or the gnats may be coming from other areas of your home or building. Additionally, gnats are very small and can enter through very small openings, so even a tightly sealed bin may not be completely effective at keeping them out.

You need to combine windmills with storage or build out an obscenely large amount to ensure you have enough electricity to supply at any given time. If you read studies on the EROI on wind, it varies a ton, usually hovering around either 4x and 40x, depending on if they include storage or not. There are different proposals for energy storage, each with their own upsides and downsides. Chemical batteries are the obvious one, but highly expensive and you&#039;d run into lithium shortages before you could do it worldwide. Gravity storage seems moderately promising (lifting concrete with a winch to store energy as gravity potential energy, releasing it to spin a turbine for electrical energy). EROI isn&#039;t the only parameter to design around: financial ROI, product lifecycle, ecological impacts (not just birds, ut also fish for offshore wind), etc. also matter.

RHR was very low, probably 40 bpm with irregular beats and palpitations in the back of my neck, heart felt wonky as shit. Scary, tho&#039; expected considering the amount of bike cycling I&#039;ve done since New Year&#039;s Eve. Physically I&#039;m a trainwreck. I have frost bite damage on each of my fingers on hands and toes, my lips are almost bloody (looks like I might even be developing H. simplex infection, we&#039;ll see), I have tendonitis of my heel tendon, I&#039;m limping... None of this is stopping me tho&#039;. I&#039;ll give my best to biohack my way out of this damage before I stop to heal. Decided to further reduce the Memantine dose to 10 mg since the function isn&#039;t decreasing anyways. The goal is to reduce it to 1 mg without noticing a reduction in function then continue this dose for the rest of my life. Omitted Nicotine and CDP choline from the stack to limit the cardiac risk. The effects of the stack appear to be permanent, I&#039;m a new man, or the man I should have become if I was never depressed and autistic. I have supreme confidence. I maintain eye contact when talking to people no matter how important or pretty. I have lost shame completely, I could talk to Donald Trump like he&#039;s my friend. Since I started this experiment not one person has denied any of the favors I ask them (which is highly unusual for me). My levels of motivation, optimism and resilience are 10x stronger than ever. I feel like I&#039;ll achieve everything I want if this mental state continues. Working memory has improved since the beginning of the experiment, tho&#039; it&#039;s not perfectly sticky. I&#039;ve begun making to do lists and executing them. I feel like a supersoldier on a mission.

Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as &quot;algebraic objects&quot;. It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject.

Analysis can be thought of as studying the properties of topological spaces (basically a space with a fundamental structure; we only care about the properties preserved under &quot;continuous&quot; deformations like &quot;stretching&quot; and &quot;bending&quot; but without ripping it, or making any holes) with a notion of &quot;distance&quot; (metric), and especially the functions between such spaces. Within here there will include properties that one can study such as the &quot;volume&quot; (measure) of sets -- sets that are uglier and more complex than one might be accustomed to. Note I am being abstract here. Real Analysis and Complex analysis, deal with the spaces [math]\\mathbb{R}^n[/math] and [math]\\mathbb{C}^n[/math] respectively. <br>Calculus is then a set of tools derived from these fields, which are then applicable to real world problems. Here we have derivatives, integrals, how to solve them in various dimensions etc.<br>As for what books, it depends on your level of maturity. If you are familiar with the ideas of calculus and have a HS level understanding of mathematics, then you can probably move on to a Real Analysis book. I personally like Tao&#039;s and N.L. Carother&#039;s books on Real Analysis. Though perhaps brush up in set theory and the language and foundations of mathematics e.g. set theory, how to prove things, logic etc. a good book on this is called &quot;How to Prove it&quot;.", "time": 1676317953, "resto": 15192912}, {"no": 15200343, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)15:03:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15200318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15200318</a><br>Thanks anon.

This scenario I provided is IF NORAD happens to even see it somehow on their radars.

in terms of solar variability, with atmo- spheric greenhouse gas concentrations providing at most a minor con- tribution. This contradicts the claim by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that most of the temperature trends since the 1950s are due to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations </span><br><br>https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon<wbr>/myownPapers-d/SoonConnollyConnolly<wbr>15-Sep11-ESR-final.pdf", "filename": "climatemongler", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 791, "tn_w": 189, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676175879617751, "time": 1676175879, "md5": "mP6LEGd+Kdw+fNyEKR8bDA==", "fsize": 105012, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "it-isnt-happening", "replies": 108, "images": 24, "unique_ips": 31}, {"no": 15195903, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:26:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15195900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15195900</a><br>lmao, this retard doesn&#039;t understand greenhouse effect, sun doesn&#039;t change in 100 years you retard.

A series of studies published starting in the mid-2000s reported the discovery of a toxic form of A\u03b2 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer&#039;s disease called A\u03b2*56. Researchers hoped that A\u03b2*56 was the protein that snowballed into those amyloid plaques. But a team of sleuths found that many of the papers describing A\u03b2*56 were fraudulent and contained an array of faked images and blots.

While a woolly mammoth can&#039;t be attributed to human activity 100% it&#039;s still a good case study to start out with since it&#039;s a media sexy project. Additionally species that are critical to their environments could be brought back just for that, which woolly mammoths again qualify being important in their role at quite literally creating their own environment out of artic terrain by holding back forests and keeping the soil fertile increasing the diversity of the region.<br>On the other hand bringing back animals that died especially ones that died long ago like this might not be feasible or desirable. They might not survive in nature due to being poorly adapted to it or low gene pool or die out again for the same reasons that killed them before like hunting or environment destruction and effort instead is quite likely better spent on preserving current environments than a white elephant project like bringing back the mammoths. And while it might sound good for a 19th british chap to drive a species extinct back to back, bringing something alive only to lock it up in a zoo because it&#039;s not feasible to have them in the wild in real populations doesn&#039;t sound too good.<br>Lastly it can still be good despite of that because cloning research is important but it can be difficult to secure funds, mammoths are media sexy and there could be lot of funding so even if it&#039;s a white elephant project it could still be important to perform scientifically and could be a foundation for future more realistic projects like bringing back species that are dying right now from much more preserved and fresh samples in reconstructed habitats in the future.", "time": 1676387517, "resto": 15200719}, {"no": 15202556, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)11:55:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15202392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15202392</a><br>Plus everyone at the time agreed that Dodos were delicious.

That&#039;s why we need proofs to make extra sure what we&#039;re saying is true. What we can do is decompose our reasoning, scrutinise and verify. Ai researchers are trying something like this by training language models that reach a conclusion sequentially through smaller, easier to verify steps. [Schizo ramblings ahead] One step reasoning leads to larger errors than multi step reasoning. Actually, i think dimensionality is key: consider a simplified model that take the set of all sentences of a fixed N dimensionality X, and mapsbit to iteself. Naturally the input might be the subset of questioning statements and the output as answers. You can think of the model as created a vector field on X, pointing a question toban answer. During training for one step reasoning, the model must learn over the full volume of X which will go something like X^N. This quickly gets intractable. Instead multistep reasoning presents of series of K lower complexity vectors in X of dimension M&lt;N. So instead you flow your way along lower dimensional (probabilistically that is) vectors to your answer. And clearly X^N will eventually always exceed in size than any K*X^M.<br><br>Interestingly, latter is more susceptible to chaotic behaviour so there&#039;s probably a fine balance to achieve.", "time": 1676424505, "resto": 15191908}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15201630, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)00:15:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Define a sequence by [math]a_1=1[/math] and [math]a_{n+1} = a_n + 1/a_n^2[/math].

This happens with affine spaces, projective spaces (homogeneous coordinates/polynomials), product of projective spaces (bi-homogeneous coordinates/polynomials),...<br>A very general notion of space with coordinate is given by the notion of Toric variety.

If S is generated by elements x,y,z,... then these elements are your &quot;coordinates&quot;. <br><br>2) Okounkov bodies: A big problem in algebraic geometry is to understand line bundles and their sections. The Riemann-Roch problem asks for understanding the sections H^0(X,L^n) for all the powers L^n of L. You can do this buy fixing a notion of order of vanishing on X (you can do this by fixing a flag of subvarieties on X and taking order of vanishings along the flag). Using this, you can see which order of vanishings appear on H^0(X,L^n) for different n. This list of vectors gives you a semigroup that depends only on L. You can recover all the intersection theory of L by doing geometry with this semigroup. (This is the theory of Okounkov-bodies and their mixed volumes).<br><br>3) Algebraic geometry of curves: Given a curve C and a point P on C, the Weierstrass semigroup of C at P is the set of all natural numbers k for which there exist a function regular outside P with a pole of order exactly k at P.

Normal toric varieties are determined by &quot;fans&quot; (a combinatorial object) and almost everything that you want to know about your variety can be translated to a combinatorial statements. As an example, the chow ring of a toric variety depends completely on its fan, so you get a definition of the chow group of a &quot;fan&quot;. You can extend this to consider the chow group of other combinatorial objects such as graphs, matroids or arbitrary &quot;tropical varieties&quot; and you arrive to the style of work developed by June Huh. I think that the Frobenius coin problem is a particular case of &quot;Chip-firing game&quot; on graphs, which is equivalent to computing the global sections of a tropical divisor on the graph.<br>But the origin of toric varieties where motivated purely by geometry.

It&#039;s the best one price/quality-wise, because the money that doesn&#039;t get spent in a flimsy mount, actually goes to the telescope itself. Also, you spend less to have more aperture, which is key.<br>- Ideally you want to spend a lot of money for eyepieces, so don&#039;t be stingy on the telescope itself.<br>- Never buy a telescope from a supermarket.<br>- Bird-jones optical designs / spherical mirrors are fucking worthless.<br>- Parabolic mirrors are peak design.<br>- Tracking DSOs, planets, etc. manually is how chads do it. Pussies use go-tos right from the start.<br>- Light pollution is your worst enemy, so don&#039;t overspend in a telescope if you live in a place with Bortle level of 8 or something.

In order to understand reality you need to understand the \u00c6ther (or you may call it Prima Materia). It is fundamental in magnetism and can be said manifest itself in a Quantum mechanical setting. (Moreover the existence of \u00c6ther is not contradicted by any form of physics). All things in existence are fundamentally in the form of waves. You may have heard this as the &quot;particle-wave duality.&quot; Except it&#039;s a little more nuanced. Fundamentally a &quot;particle&quot; is simply a wave packet in the \u00c6ther with special properties of which is it difficult to delineate at this time. However it would be reasonable in order to consider a wave packet a particle to require that it&#039;s expected energy is constant in the absence of other waves and a fairly static &quot;radius&quot; as [math] \\frac{E}{c^2} [/math] or another suitable expression can be used to define &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;momentum&quot; and the center of the sphere with the given radius as its &quot;position&quot; (even though these are uncertain experimentally and statistically within the quantum mechanical models). What I would assert is that the source of the magnetic field is the electron wave packet is a particle and has a special type of \u00c6theric oscillations (likely related to spin) which causes dynamic wave packets to form in the \u00c6ther around it which manifest in the usual notation as the particle travels through the \u00c6ther. If you places your hand near a sufficient strong magnetic field, you should feel a vortex as the dynamic wave packets causes the particle in contact with the \u00c6ther waves to move.", "filename": "alchyma", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 715, "h": 800, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676233604612581, "time": 1676233604, "md5": "OY/olQuQu3gDIV7vbtqHDg==", "fsize": 542080, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197677, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)15:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196966</a><br>You didnt understand my post and mindlessly replied to the buzzword &quot;academia&quot;.<br><br>I see you...do you even have eye, boy?", "time": 1676233795, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197714, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)15:43:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15197677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15197677</a><br>I used your terminology on purpose.<br>Why did you use a buzzword if you were attempting make a serious point?<br>I&#039;d suggest doing otherwise.", "time": 1676234598, "resto": 15194553}, {"no": 15197775, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:03:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15196984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196984</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tell me what causes electrical arcs then, if not for electrons</span><br>There would be no electrical discharge unless the conditions of the medium between point a and b allow for it in the first place.<br><br><a href=\"#p15196241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15196241</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why are schizos so obsessed with electromagnetism?</span><br><br>Every scientist and electrical engineer on earth must be total crackpots then, especially those &quot;particle physicists&quot; at CERN who do nothing but geomance magnets around to produce the phenomena they&#039;re all so wooed by.

In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.</span>", "time": 1676129136, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194224, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Guess how I know you&#039;re one of the illiterates who post frogs and sperg out about philosophy in every thread?", "time": 1676129302, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194227, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:29:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194221</a><br>A formal system is just a specific class of languages.", "time": 1676129397, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194229, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:30:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194208</a><br>Pic related also explains at the very begging of the paper the sort of systems which it applies to", "filename": "On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathematica And Related Systems (Dover 1992)(Isbn 0486669807)(600Dpi)(T)(79S) Maml(1) - Kurt_Go\u0308del_On_Formally_Undecidabl[...]", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 1502, "tn_w": 61, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676129451092621, "time": 1676129451, "md5": "IXycNUT6PICtatAxz7PGRA==", "fsize": 402782, "resto": 15194007}, {"no": 15194234, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)10:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15194227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15194227</a><br>Mathematics is just a &quot;specific class of languages&quot;, then.

I do nothing outside of work right now so I want to put all of my time and effort into learning more and developing myself if it means I can put myself in a substantially more enjoyable position with a higher QOL.<br><br>Data Analysis<br>Statistics<br>Multi Objective Optimisation<br>Programming", "time": 1676303118, "resto": 15180491}, {"no": 15199858, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)11:30:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15199775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15199775</a><br>How much maths and stats have you done in your ME degree?", "time": 1676305849, "resto": 15180491}, {"no": 15199879, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)11:40:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15199858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15199858</a><br>Not a whole lot, it\u2019s something I\u2019m learning through my work and increasingly getting more into during my free time.
