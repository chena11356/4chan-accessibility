The experiential states of this primordial will did not include perception of a seemingly external world, for there was no such world yet. Instead, they entailed only endogenous feelings. Moreover, the dispositions or impetus inherent to these feelings triggered self-stimulation or self-excitation of the will, which in turn led to the latter\u2019s unfolding into the known universe.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The primordial impetus of the will is towards self-understanding: it yearns instinctively\u2014i.e. not meta-cognitively\u2014to figure out explicitly what it wills and why. Without self-understanding, the will drowns in the maelstrom of its own unfolding. It is this irresistible impulse that, through self-excitation according to the will\u2019s natural modes, led and still leads to the rise of living organisms: the images of local, dissociative configurations of the will\u2014alters\u2014that seemingly split off from the rest so to be able to contemplate it as object.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With life, there arose the world as representation\u2014i.e. the image of the will as it presents itself from across a dissociative boundary\u2014which, in turn, enabled re-representation.

While it seems intuitive that mathematics should be able to be described by simple principles, there is no simple way to explain how humans can comprehend mathematics. What happens when we try to use first order logic to explain how first order logic works? Well, we run into paradox: situations that are impossible to resolve and do not make any sense. For example, take the liar\u2019s paradox, \u201cthis sentence is false.\u201d There is no way to make sense of this sentence, because it leads to paradox. The content of the sentence is not supposed to refer to the truth value of the statement itself. Similarly, you cannot use first order logic to refer to the truth value of first order logic itself. Sets cannot describe sets (Bertrand Russell\u2019s set paradox). And most dramatically, digital computers cannot even describe digital computers (Alan Turing\u2019s halting problem). All of this leads Roger Penrose to conclude that \u201chumans are not using a knowably sound algorithm to ascertain mathematical truth.\u201d While we can understand things and learn mathematics, it\u2019s really not clear how this is possible and something more than digital computers are required! Quantum mechanics offers a novel lens to this problem as the first order logic that appears in particles also has a supervening wavefunction that does not appear to follow the rules of first order logic.

But then the Great Questioning began, and everything humanity thought they had figured out, suddenly became &quot;up for grabs&quot; for every two bit social media or Youtube user to question. The confident boob overpowered the &quot;expert&quot; and people took fundamental ideas into their own hands to play with, without the training or understanding to read and digest scientific literature to prove or disprove things.<br><br>In the face of this questioning, confidence in knowing anything about anything now faces collapse. Threads like this one will destroy the foundation under which modern civilization rests bit by bit, and sow the seeds of total disbelief in the scientific method&#039;s ability to understand anything about the world if the scientific method could get germ theory wrong and run with it for over 100 years.<br><br>While miasma theory was able to be disposed of in a more insular and controlled era when a small group of intellectuals were considered experts in medicine and their discussions did not reach the common man, now such a huge upheaval would shake the foundations of human confidence in any medicine. We must be honest, by 2100, people won&#039;t see a terrainologist to help clean their terrain so they can be healthy. Such a fundamental shift getting to that mode of medical inquiry from the current paradigm would instead destroy the average human&#039;s belief that anything could be fixed by anyone claiming scientific expertise and lead to civilizational collapse.", "time": 1674009712, "resto": 15132841}, {"no": 15133153, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)21:48:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133128</a><br>They are real as a set of symptoms but not caused by some kind of virus transmission", "time": 1674010134, "resto": 15132841}, {"no": 15133158, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)21:50:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133141</a><br>Discussions like this are created artificially to allow space for posts like yours.

So here is what I&#039;ll do: define multiplication, and then, using induction, prove the properties you mentioned. The key idea is that when we say m * n, we mean &quot;the sum of n parcels equal to m&quot;. More precisely, for every natural number m, let [math]f_m: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}[/math] be defined as [math]f_m(p) = p + m[/math] so that [math]m \\cdot (n + 1) = (f_m)^n(m)[/math], where (f_m)^n is f_m iterated with itself n times. You might argue that this is just as arbitrary as the properties I am trying to prove, but I would disagree: the definition of m * (n + 1) is just the translation of &quot;the sum of n+1 parcels equal to m&quot; to the mathematical language. <br><br>Now with the definition of multiplication in mind, we see that [math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[\\math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]. This is really the heart of the first property. Now, the proof is as follows: let X be the set of natural numbers p such that (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p for every natural number m, n. I already have proved that 1 is in X above. Then, suppose p is in X, we will prove that (p+1) is also in X:<br><br>[math]\\begin{align}(m + n)\\cdot(p + 1)&amp;= (m+n)\\cdot p + (m +n) \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + n \\cdot p + m + n \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + m + n \\cdot p + n \\\\&amp;=m\\cdot(p+1)+n\\cdot(p+1) \\end{align}[/math]<br><br>There, I used the hypothesis that p is in X and the addition properties. We can conclude, by induction, that X = N. So we have just proved the first property. Oh fuck, I am not proving the second one, fuck it, but it just as easy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 80 iq retard</span>", "time": 1673916393, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130153, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130148</a><br>[math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[/math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]", "time": 1673916529, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130157, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are any of you guys like, professional mathematicians or have made a career out of math?<br>I kinda went NEET mode for 3 years...

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing. Given the correlation between wealth and intelligence of 0.8 its fairly safe to assume that Newtons late father was an, at least reasonably, intelligent man. His mother was the daughter of a butcher (if I recall correctly?) an esteemed profession at the time which would have required intelligence to be successful in.

Average IQ has been falling by approximately 1.5 points per decade, measurably over the past 100 years, perhaps since 1850. If you look this up you&#039;ll find Google telling you the opposite, but it&#039;s not true. Given this trend you&#039;d expect the average IQ in England to be around 85 in the next 100 years. Given immigration from the middle east and Africa, we can expect this date to arrive much sooner. Now tell me, what is the probability that you find a person with an IQ of 140+ (the rough boundary of genuis) in a country such as Trinidad where the average iq is in fact 85? Your theory purports that if we just let more low iq people fill the world and lower average iqs well get more genuises despite the fact that that the probability of genuis falls faster than populations grow.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw <br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool. <br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673942251870097, "time": 1673942251, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "please keep the /sfg/ content in the /sfg/ thread", "time": 1673943506, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130884, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130848</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeorids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power. <br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him.

You can&#039;t explain this to anyone that hasn&#039;t studied physics for around 6 years or more (and a good portion of people who have still don&#039;t understand this) so it gets dumbed down to &quot;Higgs explains mass&quot;", "time": 1674251848, "resto": 15138434}, {"no": 15139591, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)17:10:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15139510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15139510</a><br>Better yet, <br>&quot;the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of a metre [1 cm3], and at the temperature of melting ice&quot;", "time": 1674252607, "resto": 15138434}, {"no": 15140132, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:45:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15139271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15139271</a><br>Higgs mechanism is responsible for only 1% of the total mass tho", "time": 1674269153, "resto": 15138434}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15137905, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:59:44", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "The Great Filter", "com": "I think the church was right to burn scientists.", "filename": "Screenshot_2023-01-19_20-50-53", "ext": ".png", "w": 1076, "h": 655, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 152, "tim": 1674190784074642, "time": 1674190784, "md5": "E42EZoe6D4zVCfw8Z5UfXQ==", "fsize": 265167, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-great-filter", "replies": 54, "images": 9, "unique_ips": 26}, {"no": 15137911, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)00:01:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15137905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15137905</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thanks jesus for mosquitoes</span><br>fuck off back to /x/", "time": 1674190912, "resto": 15137905}, {"no": 15137912, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)00:01:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15137905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15137905</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think the church was right to burn scientists.</span><br>They never did that, but if they started now I don&#039;t think many people would blame them for doing it.", "time": 1674190916, "resto": 15137905}, {"no": 15137914, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)00:02:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15137911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15137911</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no no no we can play God just a little</span>", "time": 1674190947, "resto": 15137905}, {"no": 15138005, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:44:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15137905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15137905</a><br>they wouldnt burn their own<br>The church has a hidden affirmative action for their own people that eclipse even Jewish nepotism.", "time": 1674197075, "resto": 15137905}, {"no": 15138024, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)02:05:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15137912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15137912</a><br>Why do you use electronics?

The first rehabilitative stage was restricted by eating 2,000\u20133,000 calories a day.

public health messages would also increase people\u2019s willingness to encourage those close to them to vaccinate and to hold negative judgments of those who do not vaccinate. By encouraging those close to them to vaccinate, people are both promoting compliance with social norms and increasing their own level of protection against the disease. Also, by judging those who do not vaccinate more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote cooperative behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like indirect reciprocity or partner choice, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prosocial outcomes. Thus, effective messaging could have outsized effects on promoting vaccination if it both causes people to vaccinate themselves and to encourage those around them to do so.\u201d</span>", "filename": "UXcufgb4YFXI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 896, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674107349728512, "time": 1674107349, "md5": "B0pAXe2rQELgq/IV47Qxtg==", "fsize": 103331, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "persuasive-messaging-to-increase-covid19-vaccine", "replies": 40, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 24}, {"no": 15135788, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:54:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;npcs respond well to npc programming</span><br>many such cases", "filename": "1657099235829", "ext": ".png", "w": 592, "h": 883, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674107683790452, "time": 1674107683, "md5": "7YWlDlyPl+BmXi/0tb2/Wg==", "fsize": 452563, "resto": 15135785}, {"no": 15135800, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:09:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15135788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15135788</a><br>It&#039;s hard not to agree with the elites on this one.

By encouraging those close to them to drink the Kool-Aid, people are both avoiding being kidnapped by counter-revolutionaires and participating in a final act of revolutionary defiance. Also, by judging those who do not drink the Kool-Aid more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote revolutionary behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like doing menial tasks for the People&#039;s Church, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prorevolutionary outcomes.

Then eventually the mind becomes *even* with the poor environment he is in. And is then able to enjoy what is poor material to others, therefore looking schizo. <br><br>Therefore a mind on fire needs something greatly enthralling from the world around. How a mind ends up on fire, is usually from strong euphoric backgrounds where bars were set very high. Naturally we like to have some new things, so when this happened to isaac, and struggled to find another great thing in the environment for his now high bar mind, the process I mentioned above started. <br><br>So in short: he had it all, then failed to find new great things, his brain rotted, so he then found it easy to get glee in odd small things, this entertained him for possibly long enough till death. Otherwise if something truly great was found again, he may of had his brain on the recovery and started to appear more as he was before. <br><br>It can be hard after you find great things, to drop a gear and re-appreciate the things around you properly. As the desire for that high pertains. It&#039;s like jumping in the deep end without any methodology to help you back to safer waters. You might be able to swim in those great waters, but how long for?<br><br>It&#039;s called getting giddy and hurting yourself in the process. Clearly euphoria is a drug to recklessly chase for all brains. You can&#039;t blame them, why would you want to feel shit.

The &quot;key&quot; here likely lies in all the endogenous retroviruses (and other assorted transposable elements) in the genome of the mice (which also applies to humans). Can &quot;blame evolution&quot; for that, these parasitic genetic elements have acted like an accelerator for adaption due to two core features: being highly mobile within the genome once activated (and if still intact enough to reintegrate) and usually carrying strong gene promoters (usually controlled by cellular stress). Problem being, these sequences are still in most cases &quot;parasitic junk&quot; and get epigenetically silenced by default. Now some of them however carry a feature which in the case of a DNA double strand break (so DNA stress roughly speaking) prevents the silencing of their sequence after the chromatin has been &quot;opened&quot; for repair (this btw does play an active role in the terminal differentiation of some cell types) ... keeping them perpetually active and potentially disrupting, triggering further &quot;control mechanisms&quot; within the cell like senescence or apoptosis which contribute to aging.

But when large, rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species, both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased.[22] Technological progress constantly accelerates, and techies like Ray Kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive;[23] consequently, changes come more and more rapidly, everything happens faster and faster, competition among self-propagating systems becomes more and more intense, and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly. So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short. The seven-hundred year or thousand-year life-span to which some techies aspire[24] is nothing but a pipe-dream.</span>", "filename": "I TRIED TO WARN YOU", "ext": ".png", "w": 406, "h": 395, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1673927130171211, "time": 1673927130, "md5": "257HYnFqWBcHiyVxeoZntA==", "fsize": 143329, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130451, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)22:52:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129264</a><br>and you are going to browse /sci/ full of retarded conspiracies forever. why.", "time": 1673927533, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130525, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:34:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130426</a><br>It creates a lot of the same effects, it must mean something<br><br><a href=\"#p15130451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130451</a><br>because I&#039;m depressed and lost in life", "time": 1673930095, "resto": 15129256}, {"no": 15130538, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:43:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129256</a><br>You know what would be funny?<br><br>God sees all this and makes the thing give you so much cancer and other side effects that your lifespan is cut to 5 years, while those that rejected the DNA change are rewarded with hundreds of years of life for being faithful.<br><br><a href=\"#p15129264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129264</a><br>I&#039;m already seeing how whoremongers and whores are giving themselves and their children incurable STIs like herpes and AIDS.

There is enormous power in having the ability to set prices for this type of technology (the same way they set prices for everything else). Let&#039;s say it&#039;s not a one and done thing, but rather something you need to have done on a regular basis. Maybe you need treatments annually. The elites are ALWAYS looking to implement slavery without the risk of backlash. This means designing systems, setting laws, and pricing things to keep you on a treadmill for whatever duration they choose. You could set the price of this treatment such that in order to receive it you would need to take out a loan and pay interest in effect...FOREVER. As long as you were receiving the treatments, you would need to be working to pay the loan to receive the treatments. <br><br>Every new treatment would require additional capital which would drain your funds and force you to continue to work. You could then further add more to this such as covenants about having a good tax record or clean criminal record, all of which could impact the interest rate you pay on it making the treatment either more affordable or less affordable. A lot of people would be living indefinitely, but this is like needing to work for someone for health insurance on steroids. You could even offer price-tiered treatments such that only billionaires could afford to maintain their age in their 20s, while working slobs could only ever afford to drop their age to their late 40s or early 50s. If they wanted to go to their 30s or 20s, they&#039;d essentially bankrupt themselves.

An idealistic vision that sees humanity as a hypostatized species of its biome when, indeed, we are simply one of the incommensurable forms of sentient life randomly engendered, by nature, to be a vessel that carries around our genes. There is no intrinsic nature to life forms, we as homo sapiens, just like our simian, prehistoric ancestors, are just an ephemeral chapter in this slow and endless vortex of biomolecular mutations. Life struggle is to save itself through the species, but not the species itself (we wouldn&#039;t even be here now if that wasn&#039;t the case, since the demise of many species was imperative to the human dawn). There is no &quot;species&quot; to be saved, because every life forms is just a cycle in this infinite swirling of adaptations. Since adaptability is quintessential to survival, life ended up evolving into sapience with this self-consciousness (the illusion of existing as something other than a parasite trapped within our neurons, the deceptive idea of having an essential individuality or a soul) being only an unwanted epiphenomenon of intelligence. A man can do as he will, but not will as he will.<br>By acknowledging these facts, we already debunked the three major concerns about posthumanism (the need to save the species, to preserve the individual subjectivations and free will). The lasting matter would only be fear from the unknown: the conservative attachment to the configuration of current sapient living experience. As Ford said: If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. We can&#039;t appreciate precisely how life would be when experienced through a collective mind or through the lens of the synthesis of synthetic and organic life form, but what we do know is about our limitations that caused so much misery and suffering for hundreds of thousands of years without hope to break free from our congenital deficiencies.", "time": 1674047070, "resto": 15133563}, {"no": 15134055, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:12:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15133563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15133563</a><br>Consciousness, the experiencer of the physical sensual data stream, is not a physical object (hence why it can&#039;t be objectively observed like a physical object can).

Like how our eyes/ears/noise/skin/etc streams data to the brain. The buddhists call that streams of consciousness. The &quot;mind&quot; processing those sensory consciousness is also called a consciousness. Its a different one from the sensors, but lets first define the &quot;mind&quot; which is vague. The Buddhist define it as a group of functions of the brain. Functions like memory management, conceptual formations, sensations, thought management, internal modeling, etc. So the mind isn&#039;t a &quot;thing&quot; by itself static either. <br><br>The Buddhist says when you are normally conscious, you&#039;re always conscious of &quot;something.&quot; So when people say, &quot;I&#039;m conscious of apple&quot; whats really happening is &quot;consciousness of apple model&quot; is at the stage. People confuse this with an actor viewing the apple, but there&#039;s no actor behind the apple when you&#039;re aware of the conscious. <br>Now people will say, what about my self-awareness. &quot;I&#039;m aware of myself&quot; what about that? Thats not an apple consciousness. Its a model of self thats at the play. An error/bug within the conscious system.<br>How the object modeling works is when light hits the apple and it hits back at the eye, you see the apple image and capture/store that as part of the memory/pattern recognition. And just like when you close your eye and think about an apple, you&#039;re not seeing a real apple. Its just an object model at play. Such that the &quot;self-awareness&quot; is a bug. You can also have awareness of &quot;self-awareness&quot; a meta-meta awareness. And a meta-meta meta awareness and so on, if you train your mind to that. <br><br>Thats all in the early Buddhist text written ~2300 years ago on consciousness.

Inner noise that we near is also just neurons that ears use being activated. Same with smell, touch, etc. The combination of them can be at play when sleep/dreaming, such that a complete &quot;internal model&quot; of reality can easily be explained though physical body. Where people confuse themselves is when they confuse the apple inside the head as &quot;an object&quot;, a &quot;thing&quot;, an &quot;entity&quot;, or a &quot;qualia&quot; and consider it to be a token experience rather than simple visual neuron transactions thats just replicating what the visual cortex captures. <br><br>Hence the notion of qualia/hard problem of consciousness is confusing over what the internal modeling imprinted by the sensory organ neuron activity and taking them as qualia or some other form of reified tokens.", "time": 1674241003, "resto": 15133563}]}]
