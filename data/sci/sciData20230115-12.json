The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

The Ilulu Number Calculator is partly written in SLAM so probably they will just be released together on the same Maid Card.<br><br>I might take a break from making Computer Programs to read the Geometric Magic Squares book because I like that it has drawings on it and I want to understand the Drawings and make my Computer draw them too.<br><br>I should also probably try to make a paper about Maid Space or something but I don&#039;t know how to sound like a good math writer.<br><br>Thank you /sci/entists for reading my post.", "filename": "This will eventually happen to all of Touhou", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1412, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673624266350108, "time": 1673624266, "md5": "d39mSoxbe7NmGn1NJQEJNg==", "fsize": 882344, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121147, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)10:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120767</a><br>Amann &amp; Escher mogs them both.", "time": 1673624889, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121151, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)10:51:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want to learn more about genetics what maths will I need to better understand it?", "time": 1673625102, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121186, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:02:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/wsr/thread/1306136#p1306136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/wsr/1306136</a>", "time": 1673625731, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121237, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "thoughts on asking the ai questions instead of posting them here? i got satisfactory answers, but it might be confirmation bias, would it be?", "time": 1673626925, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121278, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:39:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15121237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15121237</a><br>If you&#039;re confident enough in your grasp of the subject to double check the AI&#039;s answers, go right ahead.<br>Otherwise don&#039;t, AI can and will randomly spout nonsense.", "filename": "bd36820b8ab6f44d265365c1c8aec8fd0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673627988840070, "time": 1673627988, "md5": "d3xvwurbkMCzvWNuWdD8Xg==", "fsize": 137654, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121299, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:47:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15121278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15121278</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; AI can and will randomly spout nonsense.</span><br>to be fair i do that too", "filename": "C9342CC8-D71F-4D09-A98A-E74B890F5F81", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1202, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673628438878210, "time": 1673628438, "md5": "UTggIV8grPi2Wof4XhFNkg==", "fsize": 169257, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121313, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)11:49:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15121278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15121278</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AI can and will randomly spout nonsense.</span><br>And /sci/ doesn&#039;t?", "time": 1673628579, "resto": 15104536}, {"no": 15121347, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)12:00:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15121237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15121237</a><br>If you got satisfactory answers from AI, your questions don&#039;t deserve to be here. <br><br><a href=\"#p15120736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120736</a><br>Your first part is wrong because you only consider the first roll.

The team returned to the site a second time with an underwater remotely operated vehicle that filmed sonar images interpreted as various pyramids and circular structures made out of massive, smooth blocks of stone that resembled hewn granite.

I&#039;d be surprised if it was human. You have to ask yourself: how did it get there? I&#039;ve looked at a lot of sonar images in my life, and it can be sort of like looking at an ink blot -- people can sometimes see what they want to see.

The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate. Abnormal ECGs were obtained in 51 (1.0%) of the students, of which 1 was diagnosed with mild myocarditis and another 4 were judged to have significant arrhythmia. None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously. Using these five students as a positive outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were 100% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac symptoms are common after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but the incidences of significant arrhythmias and myocarditis are only 0.1%. The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect but cost effect needs further discussed. What is Known: \u2022 The incidence of cardiac adverse effects was reported to be as high as 1.5 per 10 000 persons after the second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in the young male population based on the reporting system. What is New: \u2022 Through this mass ECG screening study after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine we found: (1) The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate; (2) the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%; (3) The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect.</span><br><br>I wonder why OP left this out?", "time": 1673756801, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125365, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>what&#039;s your point?", "time": 1673757512, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125389, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>meds.", "time": 1673758286, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125427, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but they&#039;ll be a lot less trusting.</span><br>that&#039;s a sign of intelligence. <br><br>Never trust authority figures.", "filename": "Joker World", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673759020239688, "time": 1673759020, "md5": "9U6pwGb5wPbnN+thWf9Fqg==", "fsize": 39430, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125432, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:05:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125197</a><br>kek!", "filename": "Vax Song", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1060, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673759122894624, "time": 1673759122, "md5": "bEbpEAOlMIE/YaOqG4V3Zw==", "fsize": 217959, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125365</a><br><a href=\"#p15125389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125389</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;17</span>% have cardiac symptoms guys!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously.</span><br>Cope.", "time": 1673761619, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125473, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically love the whole viruses aren&#039;t real gimmick and have been posting it a bunch everywhere.

College is a huge financial investment, but then without it, you stand to earn FAR less money over the course of your lifetime than if you have one. <br><br>For example, going to Law school for 3 years at a top 50 Law school in America will put you 200-300k in debt, easy. But then we&#039;re to remark, if you are top 20% of your class at those schools, you are likely to be recruited by a top law firm or corporate law division where the starting salary is usually around 160,00k, sometimes more if you&#039;ve internshipped and networked well during your summers. <br><br>So 300k sounds like a ton. 3-5 years working at a top firm with that investment, you will have paid off all of it. My friend graduated from Georgetown Law Center in 2020, I don&#039;t know where he was ranked in his class, but he was recruited by JP Morgan. He makes 220,000 a year there, and he has already paid off his $280,000 student loans in two years. He is currently looking for work in the tech world at big tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook, etc, has several interviews already for them. He&#039;ll probably secure a job at one of them in the coming weeks, and move to California, making the same money or more, no debt, and only green pastures ahead.<br><br>A Law degree is a huge investment, but once you have it, it is a Golden Ticket. Lawyers run Movie studios, Baseball teams, work in politics, finance, hold top positions at Universities, etc. IMO a JD degree is the best degree to get right now if, first of all, you like law and reasoning, but second if you are personable, pleasent, and have some level of charm about you, and are able to market your abilities relative to the degree discipline.

Studies have revealed that most HA properties depend on its molecular size. High molecular weight HA displays anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, whereas low molecular weight HA is a potent proinflammatory molecule. In this review, the authors summarize the role of HA polymers of different molecular weight in tissue regeneration and provide a short overview of main cellular receptors involved in HA signaling.

A component of the historical and philosophical legacy of science is the belief in the primacy of European institutions, practices, and conceptual schemes to the exclusion of others (Harding, 1998).

This culture and environment not only diminishes the complexities and nuances of individual identities but also stifles epistemic inclusion.

From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

The five geckos, four females and one male, were used as a part of the Gecko-F4 research program aimed at measuring the effects of weightlessness on the lizards&#039; ability to procreate and develop in the harsh environment. However, soon after the spacecraft exited the atmosphere, mission control lost contact with the vessel which led to an attempt to reestablish communication that was only achieved later in the mission.

This is not proof that the brain causes consciousness. This is proof that in the physical (virtual) world we call the universe, there is a constraint/ruleset that says if the virtual brain is injured, this effects game play. This is algo (physicality) interfacing with non-algo (mind), just as in a video game (see pic).

The physical (virtual) world is the same thing, only MUCH MORE immersive. The immersion is as such that game play can be altered up to and including the death of the (virtual) body (logging off) on to a new avatar).
