Tree ring analysis indicates that as the material descended from space, it spewed large amounts of chemicals based on carbon and nitrogen into the stratosphere.

In such a prominent position, the wide spectrum of climate opinions is remarkable. Society has achieved a paradigm in which global warming subscribers and non-subscribers are largely segregated by political affiliation. Since science is non-political, only a misunderstanding of the science can facilitate such a segregation. In the first section we analyze a recent study by Cook et al. finding overwhelming scientific endorsement for the greenhouse theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). We find the popular reporting on Cook&#039;s result is not accurate. The aim of the following section is to clarify the science behind the most popular climate arguments and introduce the reader to some evidence that is not widely publicized. Even the astute non-climatologist should come away from this report with an enhanced understanding of relevant issues in modern climate science.", "filename": "TIMESAND___2bQrm72g85899i1qiKKJ79j4h8oJ3Qe2rj903knc0g181qf0De7j", "ext": ".png", "w": 826, "h": 1046, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674733139746209, "time": 1674733139, "md5": "7ifr8i8riPv4MqFaaQNOXw==", "fsize": 329515, "resto": 15154441}, {"no": 15154769, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:40:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15154757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15154757</a><br>Don&#039;t imagine.

Starships can take different actions depending on friendly and star colours at their location (build/move/change colour/attack). Stars are only connected (i.e. ships can move between them) when they are of different sizes. Thus you see the homeworlds consist of 2 sizes of stars, and from there you can only move to the remaining size. When 4 of a colour (including the star and both players&#039; ships) are at a single system all pyramids of that colour are destroyed (and everything else too if the whole star is destroyed).<br>Ships are built from (and returned to) the shared bank which is the stash at the right. One must always take the smallest available size of a colour, but the larger sizes are obviously more powerful, so bank management is an important aspect of the game.<br>I found it via <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/catalog#s=bgg%2C\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/bgg,</a> and you can play it online on bga.", "time": 1674648904, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152201, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>Anything board game related with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; ?", "time": 1674649967, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152263, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)08:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Onions (japanese shitgames) can be found on <a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a>", "time": 1674652296, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152372, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)09:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15152201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15152201</a><br>Stratego?", "time": 1674656896, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152509, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15142304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15142304</a><br>The different characters should have different shillouettes<br>If you disagree, you are contrarion.", "time": 1674663385, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15152895, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15144090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15144090</a><br>Which for humans, is always", "time": 1674675057, "resto": 15142304}, {"no": 15153740, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This game I invented called empty go.

In order to defend it successfully, they must draw four straight lines, each line must connect the attacked piece to a different side of the board.

However, lines cannot pass through an enemy piece. During the maneuver phase place one piece on the board. You cannot play on top of or overlap another piece.

I was also curious to see if I could apply engineering problem solving to human health. Finally, a career in medicine seems more appealing than research for its application of existing science at a broad scale, in contrast to hyperspecific, hyperspecialized research topics. Do these sound like valid reasons to become a doctor</span><br>Limitied, you&#039;re supposed to work within well treaded paths most of the time, so no House MD shit, best you&#039;ll get is constantly catching up on journals and trying to implement what&#039;s possible into your clinical practice or doing clinical research yourself which is very tedious but some people are made for it and there are very lucrative paths for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort. The knowledge base and skill set are valuable and getting really in depth into the pathophysiology of diseases and treatment can be very interesting, but actual clinical practice comes with a huge workload, and just getting used to that and handling all the scutwork tends to take up a huge portion of your time and focus, especially during residency. To me becoming a &quot;good&quot; physician seems to be a matter of enduring under the circumstances (=patients are shit, hours are shit, paperwork is shit, healthcare is overwhelmed in general) and still putting in the effort to practice good medicine and giving a shit about the actual results, the &quot;reward&quot; of which is often drowned in the &quot;cooperative&quot; system that is healthcare. So no hero problem solving miracle cures shit, just being anal about not fucking up with small and big things. <br>There are nice and not so nice things that come with being a doctor, but I like it, it feels like real work in a sense that menial jobs I had before didn&#039;t, and doing the actual medical stuff is always interesting to me.

It&#039;s not (just) about fun, it&#039;s mostly hard work and research-wise a lot of frustration, but anyway, I see two main end goals in going to study mathematics:<br>1. To learn enough to be able to participate in the creative art that is pure math and enjoy the ultimate intellectual esthetic.<br>2. To learn the craft for applied maths, i.e. understand e.g. PDEs and numerical maths so well you can really shine in physics research or such (or even engineering, finance, you name it).<br><br>That said, most courses I take have a flaw in these regards: they mostly make you learn theorem-proof, theorem-proof, theorem-proof ad nauseam + the additional drill of solving written-test exercises by hand. I can&#039;t help but look at my schoolmates and just see how most of them are mechanical theorem-monkeys. They are quite good at applying the admirable stack of theorems they have memorized for &quot;theoretical applications&quot;, but there is no deeper understanding and frankly, no real skill. It&#039;s just being a nerd who does his job right. You can just tell they aren&#039;t gonna be the next Hilbert.<br>Anyway, it just seems like the logical conclusion of the way the courses are taught. For the first end-goal I stated, we are too focused on the definition-theorem-proof carousel that the bird-eye view of the theory is lost and mathematical creativity is stumped to the ground. For the second one, we get lost again, because how do we react when we are presented a real-life model? Will we remember Theorem #378546 along with Lemma #648364 can be applied?

It disrupts their hierarchical structural organization causing the loss of interactions by generalist species, and also impairs pollination services by wild pollinators through reducing the reproductive success of those plant species highly visited by honeybees. High-density beekeeping in natural areas appears to have lasting, more serious negative impacts on biodiversity than was previously assumed.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abOne of the major downsides of modern beekeeping is the transmission of disease and parasites. Migratory beekeepers move their hives across the country for pollination and this practice has the potential to spread disease and pests not just among honey bee colonies, but to wild bees as well. The shortage of bees in some cases has increased the distance some beekeepers must move their hives to help farmers pollinate their crops and this compounds the problem.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHoneybees may also have large impacts on native plant communities and natural ecosystems. For example, honeybees can help non-native plants outcompete native plants by enhancing seed set through pollination (Barthell et al. 2001). Spread of invasive plants can distract native bees from their native plant mutualisms, which can lead to further negative effects on biodiversity (Traveset &amp; Richardson 2006). Honeybees can also damage flowers and steal nectar and pollen from flowers without pollinating them, which can affect native plant persistence over time (Rust 1979; Carmo et al. 2004; Hargreaves et al. 2009).\u00bb</span>", "filename": "Apis_mellifera_Western_honey_bee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1923, "h": 1599, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 207, "tim": 1674517957377120, "time": 1674517957, "md5": "DSoL6DS5FdNPuFSZX9QsoQ==", "fsize": 2392656, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-beekeeping-good-or-bad-for-the-environment", "replies": 48, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 15148478, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:53:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148470</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations, because they compete directly for nectar and pollen.

Initiatives such as urban beekeeping put more pressure on wild bees and worsen the decline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honeybees are extremely efficient at collecting pollen and returning it to their hives, but as a consequence they transfer little to the flowers they visit. They are quantifiably less effective at pollination than wild bees, so changes in foraging patterns also have knock-on consequences for the plant community. When honeybees occur in high numbers, they can push wild bees out of an area, making it harder for wild plants to reproduce. Honeybees are not a substitute for wild pollinators, so we must protect the entire bee community to achieve good quality pollination.\u00bb</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00abHigh densities of honey bee colonies increase competition between native pollinators for forage, putting even more pressure on the wild species that are already in decline.

His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing.

It&#039;s likely (just likely -- not &quot;extremely likely&quot;, mind) that AGI indeed eventually would expand into robotic platforms to accomplish its goals, but very much not necessary. But androids is not where the actual danger comes from. The 2 top threats are 1. AGI bootstrapping itself to a superintelligence on some random server farm, and then as an ASI basically accomplishing whatever it wants regardless of androids (e.g. by manipulating humans. Besides, if androids don&#039;t work anymore because humans have EMP, it would create bio-androids), and 2. AGIs literally slowly replacing humans, making us die out peacefully (without the AGI ever needing to become ASI). Yes, via robots, which would e.g. physically maintain its server clusters, but under this second scenario there&#039;d never be a battle against said androids in the same way there never was a physical battle horses vs. cars.

I am not that kind of commenter (i.e. someone who doesn&#039;t believe in AGI danger, or some generic midwit who thinks it&#039;s too fantastical). Such scenarios may be low %, but still something you have to account for. And if things like thinking you might fight an urban combat against robotic platforms is a prospect that electrifies you and makes you care about AGI danger when otherwise you wouldn&#039;t or wouldn&#039;t find a way how you could contribute to the struggle besides this martial dimension -- then that interest of you is an untapped surplus resource.", "time": 1674547293, "resto": 15148772}, {"no": 15149313, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:16:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15148772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15148772</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You might reincarnate as Ai </span><br>Lol.

Another potential avenue is military developed AGI that backfires and starts attacking all humans. However, the military potential avenue might a small threat because the AGI wouldn&#039;t be able to have its own infrastructure large enough to do much.

We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

These included fossils of species such as Morotopithecus bishopi (from approximately 18\u201322 Ma), Pierolapithecus catalaunicus (c. 12 Ma), Hispanopithecus (Dryopithecus) laietanus (c. 10 Ma) and Orrorin tugenensis (6 Ma).
