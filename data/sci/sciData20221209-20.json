Once comfortable, though, females initiate a series of muscular vaginal contractions that rub the entire length of your member. They may also thrust rhythmically against you, so enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer that a minute or two. Just prior to her climaxing, she will up the speed of her contractions and thrusts. It is interesting to note that the times I have mated with females, they have timed their orgasm to mine.

I build high power lasers and we&#039;re always trying to push the limits. When I get new material to build a laser, I can spend weeks grinding in a lab testing all of its characteristics, realizing some system doesn&#039;t work, figuring out why, modifying an optical system, etc. At some point we see what would be a useful experiment and focus on that to get some results for a conference/paper etc. Tasks can vary from machining, plumbing and vacuum system assembly to developing control algorithms, splicing fiber-optic components, working with vendors to get custom optics made, getting some custom electronics working, making cad models to get components made by a workshop, or just building a particularly complex optical system. Most of us can do a little bit of everything but we&#039;re not experts in anything. Sometimes some external collaborators show up for a few days with some system they want to test with the new/upgraded laser. If the experiment works out I might spend a few weeks not doing much lab work while I write or simulate. Then either continue adding on to the current system or start over with new stuff. Luckily I build lasers from scratch and don&#039;t usually have to rely on some student&#039;s experimental laser b/c they are rarely built for long-term operation. Occasionally I jump in on other peoples experiments when they need help. Every so often an administrator asks me to put together some slides, diagrams or a video to advertise our work, or even to give a presentation or lab tour to some VIPs.

Our planet remains a tectonically and volcanically active world -- witness the current eruptions in Hawaii -- while Mars has been a cold, geologically dead place for the past three billion years. That was the thinking at least. But a new paper in Nature Astronomy challenges that accepted wisdom. Mars, it suggests, may still be geologically active today. The findings are the result of orbital photography, surface data, and computer modeling of a lowland region near the Martian equator known as Elysium Planitia -- where NASA&#039;s Mars InSight probe landed in 2018. Researchers from the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory analyzed recordings of Mars quakes taken by InSight and concluded that they all result from a series of subsurface fissures dubbed Cerberus Fossae, which stretch nearly 1,300 km (800 mi.) across the Martian surface.

Their muscles are designed for things like generating speed to outrun a predator or catch prey or lifting their body weight to swing through trees as a mode of transportation without exhausting themselves. And this is without training or exercise, just a normal and expected development for those species.

Just like if you haven&#039;t studied geography for years and were asked to name countries off the top of your head. You can do most, but you&#039;ll probably forget Angola or Mozambique or Tuvalu. Most social situations require that little bit of extra sharpness. If someone says a joke and everyone laughs but you, or if some bit of irony is lost on you, even once or twice... It gets picked up on immediately by the group. They notice. Humans have millions of years of social adaptation where we notice these things. The milliseconds of time it takes. Right now, you are socially obese and want to run a social marathon. It won&#039;t happen. You&#039;ll be too sluggish and brainfogged. No pop culture references, no experiences to talk about. You&#039;ll sink, not swim. So my advice is to lose the weight and sharpen yourself up in a low stakes social setting that is free from consequence.

Not some of the time, and not in rare cases, but literally anyone who has been taking these drugs for more than a few weeks will have to taper. Failure to do so with drugs like benzos could literally result in seizures and even death. In fact, there are countless guides and instructions on how to taper off of these types of medications, because as I said it is standard practice for anyone taking these medications for an extended period of time. In fact, a quick Google search provides multiple results from the CDC, state and federal health agencies, the Mayo Clinic, health departments in other countries, and other sources.

If the reward is removed they lose all interest. Now... true, maybe that&#039;s just a case of not having enough time to work them up to that point - but that&#039;s an inherent limit of working with cephalopods. They&#039;re very *very* short-lived (most species only live 1-3 years and even larger species like giant pacific octopuses or giant squids only live 4-5 years tops) so unless you genetically engineer cephalopods to have a longer lifespan you&#039;re going to keep running into that limit, with no guarantee that simply having more time is going to overcome that food-driven behavior.<br><br>Corvids, cetaceans, and primates likewise generally have to be trained on food rewards initially, but after even a moderate time of researchers working with the animals they can be observed to retain an interest in play and puzzle-solving regardless of rewards (rewards still make for a significantly better motivator, of course, but it&#039;s a start). Most crows and ravens live about 8-10 years in the wild (already about 2-4 times the lifespan of most cephalopods), but in human care they can live for more than double that. Primates, similarly can live for about 30-40 years. Cetaceans can, in theory, live longer than that (some species have estimated lifespans of 50-80 years), but cetaceans obviously don&#039;t do as well in prolonged captivity.<br><br>You&#039;re going to have an easier time domesticating and &quot;uplifting&quot; corvids than cetaceans or primates, and all three of those options are probably going to be easier than cephalopods.", "time": 1670526045, "resto": 15037628}, {"no": 15040113, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)16:02:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15039851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15039851</a><br>have you considered that &quot;cooperating with researchers&quot; is not actually a sign of intelligence?<br><br>for one thing, octopuses sensing fish taste but not seeing the fish itself, then ignoring it is legitimately direct evidence that they will use multiple senses at once to make decisions, and even prioritize some more reliable ones (i.e. sight vs scent/taste that can be caused by drifting currents and provides less information about the status of the source) over others.<br><br>researchers finding it impossible to get them to go through hoops without a reward suggests that the researchers are failing to outsmart a boneless lump of mollusk, not that the subjects are &#039;less intelligent&#039;<br><br>intelligence is not the same thing as trainability - the latter has more to do with trust and submission, and unfortunately cephalopods&#039; short lifespans really hurt the ability to build trust (though as <a href=\"#p15037642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037642</a> says, it can be extended by removing the structure that literally shuts down their production of digestive enzymes after they reproduce).", "time": 1670533370, "resto": 15037628}, {"no": 15040202, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)16:41:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15037628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037628</a><br>Niggers.", "time": 1670535706, "resto": 15037628}, {"no": 15041031, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)01:38:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15037628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15037628</a><br>why are all the animals in different art styles?", "time": 1670567934, "resto": 15037628}, {"no": 15041165, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)03:49:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "We need to create giant squid with the intelligence of killer whales.

I got a high distinction in math for my engineering degree and I struggle with all the symbols when reading things wikipedia or just whenever i come across math in my work. I look up the symbols, it takes a few minutes or whatever. Then i&#039;m like ok, i understand. Then i come come across them a few days or weeks later and i&#039;ve forgotten them all again. So i look them up again. Then again i come come across them a few weeks later and I&#039;ve forgotten them again, so I have to look them up again. It&#039;s been going on for 2 decades now. I&#039;m sick of looking up what the upside down A means. There is a pattern here.
