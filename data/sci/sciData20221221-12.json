Now let&#039;s move on to your next question: why is fusion energy going to replace fossil fuels if we already have nuclear reactors?<br><br>Let&#039;s put it in a way so that a retard will understand, again.Nuclear reactors use nuclear fission, which is basically splitting atoms to release energy. Fusion energy, on the other hand, involves combining atoms to release energy. And while both processes can generate electricity, fusion energy has some major advantages over nuclear fission.<br><br>For one thing, fusion energy is much cleaner and safer than nuclear fission. It doesn&#039;t produce any harmful radiation or greenhouse gases, so it&#039;s much better for the environment. Plus, fusion energy has the potential to be virtually limitless, since it can be produced using hydrogen, which is the most abundant element in the universe.<br><br>So, in a nutshell, fusion energy is going to replace fossil fuels because it&#039;s cleaner, safer, and has the potential to be virtually limitless.

Or do you need me to draw you a picture?", "time": 1671622301, "resto": 15068323}, {"no": 15068378, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:42:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068365</a><br>it doesnt seem to me like fusion is limitless when we only know how to do it with an isotope that is only found in fission reactor water. also fission is way safer than fossil fuels, but we continue to shut these reactors down. i think fusion will just be shot down by the fossil fuel guys", "time": 1671622964, "resto": 15068323}, {"no": 15068386, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)06:47:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15068378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15068378</a><br>Oh, well excuse me for being a mere retard-explainer and not knowing everything about fusion energy! I stand corrected, you are clearly the expert here.<br><br>You&#039;re right, we do currently only know how to produce fusion energy using tritium, which is an isotope that can be found in the water of fission reactors. But that doesn&#039;t mean fusion energy is not limitless! Scientists are constantly researching new ways to produce fusion energy using different materials, and who knows what they might come up with in the future?<br><br>As for your point about fission being safer than fossil fuels, I agree with you. But unfortunately, politics and economics often trump safety and environmental concerns. That&#039;s why we continue to shut down nuclear reactors and rely on fossil fuels, even though they&#039;re not as safe or environmentally friendly.<br><br>As for your belief that fusion energy will just be shot down by the fossil fuel guys, I can understand why you might think that. But I have faith that eventually, common sense and science will prevail, and we&#039;ll see the widespread adoption of fusion energy as a clean and limitless source of energy.

When you apply to community college, you will speak with the advisor and let them know that you&#039;re interested in going into nursing. Something you&#039;ll have to do before getting into the nursing school aspect is taking the Nursing Entrance Test (NET). <br>https://nursejournal.org/resources/<wbr>nursing-entrance-exams-guide/<br>They may set you up to take prerequisites and any potential remedial classes before setting you up for it. They&#039;ll use that test along with grades as a determining factor for whether or not they accept you into nursing school. Your prereqs are generally going to be a comp class, a few humanities classes, history, A&amp;P 1&amp;2, microbiology, communications, a math course or two, and gen chem.<br>A lot of places online offer distance learning courses, but you have to put in the research on whether the place you&#039;re attending in person in the future accepts those credits. Sometimes they&#039;ll only accept a certain amount of credits before requiring that you earn some with their campus. It&#039;s honestly the best if you&#039;re able to do all your online coursework with the same place you&#039;re planning to attend nursing school so that you can avoid any potential bullshit, but do whatever you&#039;ve gotta do. Many community colleges will have an associates degree program for RN. That associates just tacks on your prereqs and nursing school, then you go on to take your licensure testing. <br>Something to consider: you can get similar jobs to RNs through going through an accredited school to become a licensed practical nurse/licensed vocational nurse. <br>https://www.mdc.edu/nursingadmit/lp<wbr>n.aspx<br>That&#039;s near you. Look into it, because even if local pay looks shitty, they&#039;re heavily in demand and you can potentially find something online. You&#039;re also going to possibly have better options, since you can work in doctor&#039;s offices and other facilities that have decent schedules where they won&#039;t run you ragged.", "time": 1671625501, "resto": 15065764}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15065150, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)16:16:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is it that there are so many endocrine disruptors that have estrogenic effects but basically none that mimic the effects of testosterone?

After earning a PhD, you can\u2019t, for example, work for five years in a non-academic job, and then expect to be hired as an assistant professor. If you want an assistant professorship but don\u2019t get one straight out of graduate school, then you have to join the army of post-doctoral researchers (\u201cpostdocs\u201d) and adjuncts moving from one temporary position to another until someone hires you for a quasi-permanent job (see Reason 71). And chances are that you won\u2019t be hired as an assistant professor straight out of graduate school (see Reason 14). You\u2019ll probably have to spend some time as an adjunct in academic purgatory, where the pay is so low and the work is so unstable that it can be a struggle to make ends meet.

Physicalism made room for &quot;physical&quot; things that can&#039;t be thought of as concrete or tangible or even determinate, but no account of it defines what the essence of a &quot;physical&quot; thing is, so realistically speaking, you&#039;re asking me to explain the difference between idealism and your vague feefees.", "time": 1671622399, "resto": 15063145}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15065537, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:56:28", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/scg/ - STEM Careers General", "com": "Any other GeologistChads around?", "filename": "8C8DDADF-178B-44A8-9406-4E0048EEE302", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 314, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 153, "tim": 1671497788074425, "time": 1671497788, "md5": "51dhxDJNDILmGrjPzmqIBw==", "fsize": 55517, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "scg-stem-careers-general", "replies": 50, "images": 13, "unique_ips": 32}, {"no": 15065595, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)20:30:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m transferring into Purdue (polytechnic institute) in the summer.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

I also cannot comment on whether this qualifies as &quot;science&quot; or not, but taking a guess I&#039;d say it&#039;s closer to politics. The long and short of it is that any nation based on taxpaying citizens have a vested interest in making sure their taxpayers live long, productive and healthy lives. If they do that they spit more dish into the state piggy bank over the span of their lives. A lot of political decisions on healthcare is reflected in this but at the same time there&#039;s also a lot of genuine political will to ensure these citizens live happy and qualitative lives (barring a few obvious exceptions around the world). This can stem from either election strategy considerations, party-policy or even once in a blue moon an altruistic desire to just make the country a better place. It&#039;s not clearcut. <br>Either way. Mental healthcare is underfunded and poorly developed in many countries which means that treatment usually amounts to drugs and bare bones therapy, often with little to no follow-up or even subsequent titration. There&#039;s many reasons why I don&#039;t approve of the way it currently is.

Yes, the hyperglycaemia is a medical emergency in itself, but is a symptom of inability to uptake sugar which is the real problem, which in turn is caused by the secondary pathology of malfunctioning pancrea cells which in turn have been caused by any number of primate etiologies. <br><br>It&#039;s an interesting article though.

Read actively, paying attention to every word, and read cover to cover unless you&#039;re already familiar with the subject matter and are just checking out a different book from one you&#039;ve already read in detail.<br>3. Linear notes are too restrictive, and mind maps are mostly a meme that encourages time-sucking perfectionism. Instead, get cards on which you note down important techniques, theorems, etc. You can then easily rearrange the cards, scrap a card, replace a card with a better version, etc., and thereby avoid many of the headaches of linear notes. When you&#039;re finished with the book, wrap an elastic band around the cards and throw the stack into a &#039;knowledge box&#039;. You can use your stack collection whenever for review, spaced-repetition shit, etc. Don&#039;t bother with elaborate storage methods like Zettelkasten unless you want to spend half your time maintaining a metadata web.<br>4. It&#039;s a matter of taste which problems to solve, and the availability of answer keys or solution manuals will often dictate your choice. Modern books often have an unnecessarily large number of exercises. You can go the OCD route of solving every problem, but this can kill all motivation if, for instance, you&#039;re not passionate about the book you&#039;re reading and are reading it purely to brush up before getting to what you&#039;re actually passionate about. You can go the odd- or even-numbered-only route, given that many books are designed so that you won&#039;t miss anything important if you do so. If you know your abilities without delusions, you can smash books fast by just reading the problems and skipping those you&#039;re sure you know how to solve.<br>5. It can help motivation to work through three or more books in parallel, and when you leave one book, try to leave it on a &#039;good note&#039; that makes you look forward to returning.

We have never sent a probe far enough into deep space to ascertain the extent to which signals from the Earth are scattered at each increment of distance between our solar system and our nearest neighbor. As a concept, the viability of delivering a message over a distance of multiple lightyears is entirely unproven. In fact, in 2022, signals from the Voyager probe began arriving in a garbled state not consistent with any internal fault expected by NASA. It is highly probable, in my view, that these garbled signals result from interaction between outgoing EM from the Sun and Voyager&#039;s transmissions. At the time of the disruption, the probe was merely 14 billion miles from Earth. If a signal moving toward Earth without a great deal of noise in its &quot;background&quot; would fail to travel a fraction of a light year without corruption, there would seem to be little chance that a signal could arrive intact after traveling multiple lightyears.<br><br>Beyond the simple issue of signal-to-noise ratio, two other important forces come into play. One is the magnetic field of the star, which has a lensing effect that could distort and redirect a signal and the other is the combination of the magnetic and Coulomb forces associated with the EM emitted from the stars in question.

I have written about this effect in previous publications and scientists have recently confirmed, perhaps unwittingly, its verisimilitude in research done in the area of using excitons to transport electrical energy between stationary electrons without any flow of electrons. It is no longer a mere hypothesis that a more granular phylum of electricity can flow between electrons. It is a fact (see Indium-Tin-Zinc-Oxide.)<br><br>Weakening electromagnetism will tend to curve in the direction of higher gravity as it exits a star system. With each quantum of energy sapped from an electron in such a scenario, its phase height relative to wavelength is reduced. With each such reduction in phase height, the failure of the electrons to achieve their full height results in a change in their angular momentum. This amounts to a lensing effect.<br><br>Thus, we have at least two lensing effects at work on top of a natural scattering effect. In order to prove that it would be truly impossible for a coherent signal to make the journey between two stars, a computer simulation that properly accounts for these lensing effects should be run to track what happens to EM as it exits a solar system.<br><br>A metaphor in optics for these effects is the use of four lenses, as seen in the posted image, in order to cloak an object in the center of the four lenses.

The cellular genetic code of our cells won the struggle for survival and any competing chemistry, if that chemistry existed at all found itself at an evolutionary dead end and was wiped from the universe by failure to compete. If scientists do develop synthetic life in a different form, then anti-methodological naturalists will complain that it\u2019s not exactly like the cellular life we have now. If they find a way to synthetically derive the current genetic code then those same scoffers will complain that it took technology to do it, and thus couldn\u2019t be natural.

It suggests to me, meth users and other drug users actually get a bang for their buck and dont have their entire next day ruined by severe hangovers (this was my case when i was 25 ). Alcohol is a piece of shit high, compareably to other drugs, it is at the bottom and for some reason the negatives exceedingly scale any positive effects(usually one hour).

I once went home and found three gorgeous women waiting for me in my bed in sexy outfits - all taller than me I might add (my little sister happened to be with me at the time - she was visiting; awkward). The point is, if you&#039;re interesting, charming, and well respected by other men, women will not care. You have no idea how many times, to my own surprise even, I have been picked by a woman over tall men. It is not about how tall you are. Women only think that way when they are thinking in the vacuum of abstraction - i.e. before actually getting to know any given man. You determine your own desirability, and do not be daunted by any rejections you may face. Being unwounded and unwounding in the face of rejection is a masculine trait you should feel joy in holding, and it is attractive enough to women to start changing their minds about you in some cases. Just be a good, strong man - inside and out. Oh, and be wise. Pick a wife. By your mid twenties, the best ones of your age will be paired up already in many cases. Don&#039;t waste time chasing skirts. It&#039;s fun at the time, but you&#039;ll look back and realize it was mostly pointless. Hope this helps.

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven. As with any DL algorithm they will not generalize well, you have no guarantees and you need to solve them yourself first (to generate the training data) to be able to train them.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture. A lot has been done in incorporating group symmetries into NN (convolutional nets, g-convolutions, graph networks) - same can be done for physical laws (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741)<br><br>The second is discovering the underlying PDE from data i.e. symbolic regression.

You walk into the building with low expectations but are pleasantly surprised when the people there are all the best scientists, engineers, and doctors in the world. They tell you that because you were the first one to walk in you can be the first person to try out their new immortality program if you wish. In order to sooth your doubts they explain to you how it will work. First they show you a machine that is called the brain scanner. The brain scanner can scan someone\u2019s brain and download the position and structure of its neurons. This machine can then produce mock neurons made of silicon, other metals, and polymers, that are exactly the same as the neurons it has scanned. The machine can also do the same for other brain cells that are necessary for support and nutrient dispersal in the brain. They explain to you that they will first scan around fifty million of your brain cells, which is about zero point zero five percent of your total brain cells, and produce them. Next they will surgically remove fifty million of your identical brain cells and replace them with the new artificial ones. Finally they will patch up your head and send you home.

This robot body can do anything a human body can but is again made of a variety of metals and polymers. It is designed to be able to accept a fully formed artificial brain. After they have finished converting your brain to artificial cells they will place it inside of the robot. After this is completed you will be able to get consistent repairs and live forever. They also tell you, and you later confirm by yourself, that this process is practically guaranteed to be successful.

If yes, you go home and then show up the next day ready to start. However, upon your arrival you are informed that although the brain scanner and robot body are operational, the doctors who would have been performing the surgery have become unsure whether they can perform the surgeries safely or not. Because of this they have declined to go forward with the program. The scientists and engineers offer you a new plan, they will scan all one hundred billion of your brain cells at once. Then they will put this new brain in the robot body. After that they will throw your original body into an incinerator. Do you still decide to go ahead with this plan? If not, why not?

Just as in Mexico. States will give water priority to their largest cities (Reno, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Odgen, Phoenix, Yuma, Tuscon), counties will rate all their ZIP codes based on water network access, and individual towns will have to self-finance collective water delivery or force that cost onto individual homeowners.

Suburban tract developments will slowly rot away and be outright abandoned as water rationing is instituted and their taps are shut off before others. The &quot;shut off&quot; itself doesn&#039;t necesarily have to be permanent either - again using Mexico as an example, certain districts will have their water shut off seasonally to preserve it for larger urban districts. Others will have the equivalent of a &quot;brown out&quot; and use dirtier non-potable water, but by this point people will tolerate it to wash with. Individual homes will be rated on their water factor and single family detached housing will be very unfavorable to large apartment complexes and condos that have collective water delivery paid by tenants&#039; HOA fees.

Excluding Nevada, the mountain states actually have more water than southern CA with a fraction of the population. Most of the water supplies are artificially siphoned to southern CA which has a local population that exceeds the carrying capacity, generating a deficit in the supply of all surrounding states.

Water is frozen when its atoms arrange themselves in a lattice configuration. This happens because the thermal oscillations of the atoms are no longer sufficient at sub-zero temperatures to counteract the mutual repulsion of the negatively charged electrons of the H2O. These molecules constantly seek to maintain a maximal diffusive distance from one another. When electrons align, Coulomb forces are multiplied. As such, when water takes on a lattice configuration, the water can diffuse to a greater extent than otherwise possible if it were in a liquid state.<br><br>When water is above a certain temperature, individual molecules can move about randomly, breaking the ordered structure and rendering the overall body of molecules a liquid. Thus, two forms of motion; thermal motion and the Coulomb-enhanced diffusive motion are at odds with one another.<br><br>One of the key behaviors of freezing water that makes cryogenic preservation problematic is the expansion that occurs in the instant of the phase change. While it is generally true that liquids contract as their temperature decreases, the boundaries of phase changes of matter are an exception to this rule.<br><br>This brings us to the reason why room-temperature crystallization of water is the solution that will enable successful suspended animation. If it were possible to cause water to transition to a frozen state at room or body temperature or even higher temperatures, metabolic functions could be halted by bringing about a crystalline configuration of water within the body without any refrigeration or chemical injection.", "time": 1671511866, "resto": 15065853, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}, {"no": 15065856, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:52:14", "name": "YWPTS", "com": "The key difference here is that since the water is at a comparatively high temperature to begin with; having not undergone the contraction associated with the drop from 36\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C; it would not expand harmfully when it enters the artificially-enhanced Coulomb-induced frozen state.<br><br>While Coulomb forces acting without the benefit of aligned electrons are understood to have the ability to extert force over a distance of about four atomic widths of hydrogen, when alignments exist, the field of influence can be expanded almost indefinitely. Crystals such as quartz have already been synthetically constructed in order to create these alignments to exert Coulomb force over great distances.

So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

I am not a racist by any means, but due to all that aid they are getting it puts them (Africans living in Africa, not emigrating) at even worse position, due to way more blacks than African land could sustain.
