Well, anyway, here&#039;s a direct quote from him from 2010<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me. When our Foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health. That was the main thing we did because I thought population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face. You\u2019ve got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to do that. That\u2019s the only thing that really counts. Well then I came across articles that showed that the key thing you can do to reduce population growth is actually improve health. And that sounds paradoxical. You think, \u2018OK, better health means more kids not less kids.\u2019</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWell in fact, what parents are doing is they\u2019re trying to have two kids survive to adulthood to take care of them. And so, the more disease burden that there is, the more kids they have to have to have that high probability. So there\u2019s a perfect correlation that as you improve health, within a half generation the population growth rate goes down. In fact Hans Rosling, here at this conference, in two of my favorite speeches, actually showed that unbelievable correlation that population growth has gone down. Today, where is there high population growth? It\u2019s in the places with the worst health conditions \u2013 northern Nigeria, northern India. And so the two problems go exactly hand in hand. If we improve health rapidly we will get the peak population to be as much as a billion below the current expected peak. That is about 8.3 billion versus 9.3.\u201d</span><br><br>So I guess that&#039;s how he thinks, take it as you will", "time": 1675518875, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177064, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)08:59:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15177056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15177056</a><br>so he want to increase health by reducing the population, and reducing the population by vaccination.<br>make sense", "time": 1675519170, "resto": 15176915}, {"no": 15177067, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)09:08:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15176915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15176915</a><br>gates is a retard if he is such a pleb he really thinks mars is the be all, end all.

If you think imaginary numbers are weird, I don&#039;t blame you. But negative numbers are just as weird, we&#039;re just conditioned by primary schools to accept them. So the only reasons uninitiated normies think &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers (negative numbers are just a imaginary, as are arguably ALL numbers) are special, is because they&#039;re allowed to drop out of math class before getting that far.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a negative amount of something. You can&#039;t travel a negative distance. Negatives only make sense in the context of direction. You can travel a positive distance in a negative direction. &quot;Negative money = debt&quot; means you owe a positive amount of money directed at someone else. Entertaining negative numbers means thinking of them as being on a line, where the positive numbers go one way, and the negative ones go the opposite DIRECTION.<br><br>&quot;Imaginary&quot; numbers extend this concept in beyond the line, to a plane, where more than just two directions are possible:<br>When you multiply positive numbers, the magnitude grows, but the results only ever end up on the right side of the number line. When you multiply negative numbers, the magnitudes multiply as usual, but their &quot;direction&quot; (their sign) flips to the opposite side of the number line (exactly a 180 rotation).<br><br>To actually answer your question: If positive multiplication is 360 rotation (ie: no rotation) and negative multiplication is 180, then a 90 rotation is exactly half of whatever a 180 one does. What does that look like? Well, -1 squared is 1 :: 180 * 2 = 360. Whatever the square root of -1 is must correspond to 90. In fact, the square root operation corresponds to finding exactly half the angle on a complex plane. We don&#039;t have to stop there either. A cube root corresponds to a third of the angle.

The magnitude of the complex number can encode the voltage while the direction encodes the phase.

By encouraging those close to them to vaccinate, people are both promoting compliance with social norms and increasing their own level of protection against the disease. Also, by judging those who do not vaccinate more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote cooperative behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like indirect reciprocity or partner choice, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prosocial outcomes. Thus, effective messaging could have outsized effects on promoting vaccination if it both causes people to vaccinate themselves and to encourage those around them to do so.\u201d</span>", "filename": "UXcufgb4YFXI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 896, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674107349728512, "time": 1674107349, "md5": "B0pAXe2rQELgq/IV47Qxtg==", "fsize": 103331, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "persuasive-messaging-to-increase-covid19-vaccine", "replies": 196, "images": 40, "unique_ips": 88}, {"no": 15135788, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:54:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;npcs respond well to npc programming</span><br>many such cases", "filename": "1657099235829", "ext": ".png", "w": 592, "h": 883, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674107683790452, "time": 1674107683, "md5": "7YWlDlyPl+BmXi/0tb2/Wg==", "fsize": 452563, "resto": 15135785}, {"no": 15135800, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)01:09:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15135788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15135788</a><br>It&#039;s hard not to agree with the elites on this one.

By encouraging those close to them to drink the Kool-Aid, people are both avoiding being kidnapped by counter-revolutionaires and participating in a final act of revolutionary defiance. Also, by judging those who do not drink the Kool-Aid more negatively, they apply social pressure to others to promote revolutionary behavior. This would be consistent with theories of cooperation, like doing menial tasks for the People&#039;s Church, that rely on free riders being punished or ostracized for their past actions to encourage prorevolutionary outcomes.

A sudden windfall that would invariably solve all of life&#039;s problems in one fell swoop and confer agency is beyond the dollar value and is almost an infinite increase in quality of life and happiness and accordingly makes the subjective positive expected value infinite. If you possess high intelligence, your phenomenological awareness of the situation means even having 100k saved up isn&#039;t enough to provide any sense of relief. You&#039;ve mistakenly assumed the opportunity cosf of a ticket could have made a difference. If you saved $500 a month, you&#039;d have about 200k after 20 years if invested. Let me tell you something. The older you get the less subjective value money has. That might sound like a lot to a midwit like you but if one did it at 30 years old, 200k might as well be nothing if you&#039;re 50. I put away about $4k a month for 3 years and I felt the same with low 6 figures than I do with nothing because it was not enough to stop working for any significant length of time. If I tasked you with procuring me several million dollars in the span of a week, you&#039;d laugh. However, if I was a fiendish villan and had your family hostage and you had no legal recourse and you indeed realized I was serious, knowing that their existence and your life would come to a swift end if you failed, you would experience a condition of poverty which is desperation. At the end of the week you&#039;d see a billboard with the lottery jackpots and knowing the peril of the situation would risk all the money you had even if the chance is slim because there is no alternative. Poor people lead an existence in perpetual captivity to their employers and hold no agency and such an existence is a lifelong experience of the hypothetical week posited.

One of the ideas with the definition of the class invariants is that they have many nice transformation properties when you make all sorts of substitutions for [math]n[/math] <br>As another funny example, it turns out that [math]G_5=\\sqrt[4]\\varphi[/math] where [math]\\varphi[/math] denotes the golden ratio.", "time": 1675529319, "resto": 15165895}, {"no": 15177369, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)11:59:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15177338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15177338</a><br>also, here primes denote the complementary modulus (just in case)<br>also, it&#039;s worth commenting on this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when the perimeter of the ellipse can be calculated exactly in simpler terms</span><br>you don&#039;t necessarily even need the gamma function either.

Come up with an idea and make a startup business, or join an existing startup. Teaching yourself programming opens up a lot of opportunities, mostly full stack web development because then you can create a whole product yourself. It helps if you&#039;re confident with talking to people and just being around people in general, a lot of programmers aren&#039;t, including myself. Running a startup involves a lot of talking to people usually. But if you can create a useful product that people want to use and you get a bunch of customers and it&#039;s profitable for more than a year or two then you might be able to sell it for a few million depending on size and market etc. I&#039;ve been interested in startups for about 15 years and the hardest part is finding good people to work with. It&#039;s almost impossible. I&#039;ve asked dozens of people I&#039;ve worked with at regular jobs and friends and relatives and other people and maybe 1/40 people is interested in working on things outside of work. Most people aren&#039;t rich because they don&#039;t do anything to try to become rich. It isn&#039;t easy but it&#039;s not impossible either and most people don&#039;t even try at all ever even when everything is explained to them or someone is spoonfeeding them what to do.

I&#039;m trying to minimize the numerical error in my orbits. To illustrate why, consider a renderer for an Earth-Sun system. The camera is located at the origin, the Sun and Earth at $r_s$ and $r_e$ respectively. To calculate $r_e$, we can use the parametric circle equation as an approximation with $r_e = (x_e, y_e), x_e(t) = r\\cos(t) + x_s, y_e(t) = r\\sin(t) + y_s$. Notice that when the magnitude of $r_e$ is smallest and most in need of precision (Earth is near camera), the equation becomes the sum/difference of two large numbers and therefore subject to the largest numerical error. My intuition tells me it should be possible to rearrange the equations such that $r_e$ is a function of $t$ and some proximate $r_e(t_0)$ so that I don&#039;t need to take the sum or difference of large numbers unless the $r_e$ is already going to be large. Is this actually possible? My retard-tier trig skills have gotten me nowhere and I can&#039;t think of any fancier techniques I could use. If it is possible, can the method for circular orbits be extended to Keplerian orbits?

Peano arithmetic PA proves that every program either halts or does not halt, which makes &quot;halts: (N^N)-&gt;{yes, no}&quot; a functional association. Meanwhile, in the metalogic we find that there&#039;s actually no computable function for which PA would prove that it decides the halting problem, so the above &quot;function&quot; is not of the computable kind (a bit like how Choice postulates there&#039;s functions that we however know not to be of the computable kind). In turn, constructively you can postulate that the function spaces like N-&gt;{0,1} a.k.a. 2^N only hold computable functions, and this object then becomes &quot;much smaller&quot; than the elusive P(N) and you can postulate it to exist without needing to postulate powerset.<br>The constructive set theories like that are nice and they are close to type theory: You can postulate that Y^X exists even for countably infinite sets Y^X, while also postulating that Y^X is not bigger than N, in the sense that a subset I_{X^Y} of N surjects onto Y^X. E.g. you can list all the computable functions from N-&gt;N, which can be taken to equal N-&gt;N. And so indeed, you can here postulate that all sets A in this theory correspond to some index set I_A of S. <br>Although without excluded middle you have to rethink both the meaning of &quot;function&quot; as well as that of &quot;subset&quot;. This theory however has no Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals a priori have no modulus of convergence.

So you have a set amount of receptors that you want to target with a drug, you give a certain amount of the drug to built up a concentration of the drug in various compartments of the body that are in a chemical balance wih each other. Say one of these compartments is your intercellular space, another one is your blood and another compartment would be the molecule being bound to the receptors that you want to target. The concentration of the drug molecules in these compartments is in a constant balance. Your blood gets filtered by the kidneys, so the blood concentration of the molecules constantly decreases, which leads to molecules from the other compartments shifting into the blood and decreasing the amount of molecules that are bound to and interacting with the targeted receptor, so the effect of the drug starts wearing off. Even drugs that get used up work in that way, with the difference that the molecules that bind permanently to their target can&#039;t shift back into the other compartments, but the normal dosage you&#039;ll administer includes the anticipation that some of the drug will get filtered out before it can permanently bind to it&#039;s target.

The tesseract refers to four spacelike dimensions (Euclidean). <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper<wbr>cone", "filename": "TIMESAND___9so43Ev1eh7wx4djhfgld4m6Nz5t0f8Rf1dvFea82VZ8gx3T4", "ext": ".png", "w": 665, "h": 471, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1675521502691096, "time": 1675521502, "md5": "tSHM1z0Yim3IpcoxQoUawQ==", "fsize": 490495, "resto": 15172121}, {"no": 15178820, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:30:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1675571445, "resto": 15172121}, {"no": 15180017, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)12:25:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15172121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15172121</a><br>is there a 5d gif of that?", "time": 1675617942, "resto": 15172121}, {"no": 15180436, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)15:10:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15177111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15177111</a><br>checked and there&#039;s also the hypersphere", "time": 1675627854, "resto": 15172121}, {"no": 15181693, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)04:03:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by8<wbr>eAnez0i8<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ad<wbr>9y0FmQ9g<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz<wbr>uXyuF9DQ<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbq<wbr>9uX_MycY", "time": 1675674222, "resto": 15172121}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15181533, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:41:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This kid is smarter than /sci/.", "filename": "1675640685071467", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 637, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 212, "tim": 1675665666988683, "time": 1675665666, "md5": "gpuKgAaX8zh0YxOqV5Zmmg==", "fsize": 323951, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-kid-is-smarter-than-sci", "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 15181538, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:44:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181533</a><br>underage b&amp;", "time": 1675665861, "resto": 15181533}, {"no": 15181548, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:53:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181533</a><br>why is it that black holes are the number one...", "time": 1675666404, "resto": 15181533}, {"no": 15181558, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)02:01:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181548</a><br>...most popular popsci topic of discussion amongst the brainlet soience fangoys?<br>is it the comic bookish aspects of the spectacular, unrealistic and completely non disprovable conjectures which go along with the topic that make black holes so popular amongst the scientist posers and wannabes?", "time": 1675666874, "resto": 15181533}, {"no": 15181626, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)03:16:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181548</a><br>they\u2019re big and easy to understand without being boring. unlike say a pulsar or a quasar, or a nebula", "time": 1675671370, "resto": 15181533}, {"no": 15181685, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)03:59:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15181533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15181533</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9 year old nigger graduates high school</span><br>Think this says more about the high school than the nigger tbqhwh", "time": 1675673947, "resto": 15181533}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15178559, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:37:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "NASA Loses Ganymede Images", "com": "What was the signal from Ganymede?

They should more accurately be called atypical hyposerotonergics as their primary effect of downregulating serotonin sensitivity is achieved after elevating serotonin levels for some time, hence the atypical effect of not working directly.<br><br>The antidepressant effect is actually secondary and is because of an increase in BDNF that induces adult brain growth and activity that matches well with brain imaging observations, that depression is a brain state of reduced activity. Most anxiety disorders on the other hand stem from oversensitive serotonin receptors due to runaway behavioral adaptions of the neurochemistry because of excessive fearful stimuli in a modern environment. The original hunter-gatherer societies we lived in had essentially worry free environments compared to agricultural life and we are clearly not adapted to it yet, although sociopathic behavior is rapidly increasing in the gene pool as a counter to this.<br><br>Pretty much all the effects of any serotonin increasing medicine are identical to the non-behaviorial symptoms of anxiety disorders. Reduced appetite, anhedonia, increased sweating and such. It therefore only makes sense logically that eventually reducing serotonin in anxious people will lead to a reduction in their symptoms, which recent brain imaging confirms. The work of T Furmark work is a good reference. <br><br>Depression is a much simpler disease to deal with but the cure is harder to achieve with psychiatric drugs.

The protons are, of course, held in place by a powerful Coulomb grid established by the larger exterior cube, which is made from a crystalline form of lead. So many hydrogen ions being forced into proximity in this configuration, those of you who are familiar with my work know, enables exponentially greater numbers of electrons to be stored amongst the protons. The entire contents of the inner cube of the CSPG behave as a plasma. Importantly, this means the electrons are in constant motion.<br><br>Thus, in creating this concept for the CSPG several months ago, not only was an energy storage technology of unprecedented potential described, but a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) device was, as well.

We should expect, in such a system, to find missing electrons. What if, however, we found that we still had our electrons, every last one, no matter how much light was generated with the device? Electrons will not exit the voltage cell unless allowed to do so through a cathode. Where, then, would the energy come from to both retain all electrons in the CSPG and emit copious amounts of light? The answer lies in the neutrino vacuum effect I mentioned several times in previous publications. To have swarming electrons in a closed chamber would result in large amounts of interaction between magnetism and electrical charge. As my readers know, this results in energy being altered in terms of its mass and, from our perspective, disappearing into the past. The void within an electron created by this phenomenon is automatically filled in by neutrinos from the surrounding area. The mere fact this is possible is proof that we are floating on a sea of truly limitless neutrino energy to which we have had essentially zero access until now.<br><br>If confirmed, this would constitute the first discovery of true Zero-Point Energy and a means of not merely harnessing and converting into electricity gravitational energy (neutrinos) but also deliberately drawing closer the gravitational energy so as to be able to harness it, leading to substantial net energy gain from a technology originally intended merely to be an energy storage system.<br><br>The Future Is Made in America<br>06Feb2023", "time": 1675664761, "resto": 15181510, "trip": "!!IuuVuD1WWdT"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 15181490, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:56:13", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Relativity if observers could agree on the time it takes for light to arrive,", "com": "I already posted the question on stack exchange, but maybe someone here will know.

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

(why does 4chan hate nature links)</span><br><br>Let me give some quotes on how skewed the study design is: <br>&quot;The primary outcome was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection as measured by any VA medical record or Medicare claim containing a diagnosis for ICD-10 code U07.1. We also looked at COVID-19 ending in mortality as a secondary outcome. We defined COVID-19 ending in mortality as any death within 30 days following infection. Although death certificate data were unavailable and would be preferable, mortality occurring shortly after infection is likely to be strongly correlated with actual COVID-19 mortality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the vitamin D3 cohort, the COVID-19 rates were 2.66% for the treated and 3.30% for the controls, while the rates of COVID-19 infection followed by death within 30 days were 0.23% for the treated and 0.35% for the controls.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.66% vs 3.30%</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 0.23% vs 0.35% </span><br><br>&quot;Our association would be overstated if vitamin D-supplemented patients were disproportionately underdiagnosed than control patients. This is because patients with undetected infections would be unlikely to be reinfected when testing availability expanded later during our study period. Second, our measure of COVID-19 ending in death within 30-days could also be inaccurate because we did not have access to death certificate data to confirm the actual cause of death. However, many deaths immediately following COVID-19 infection are likely to be at least partially related.<br><br>The availability of vitamin D3 without a prescription also limits our ability to ensure we have fully categorized dosage and supplementation intensity.&quot;<br><br>they bent data, made assumptions and didn&#039;t actually find any significant difference.", "time": 1675236284, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>I looked in the astroturfed zinc and quercitin recommendation to prevent covid.<br>It is all the same.<br>Does nothing and is potentially toxic.", "time": 1675271931, "resto": 15164261}, {"no": 15169874, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15164261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15164261</a><br>Thoughts on taking 10,000 IU vitamin D daily?
