The &quot;key&quot; here likely lies in all the endogenous retroviruses (and other assorted transposable elements) in the genome of the mice (which also applies to humans). Can &quot;blame evolution&quot; for that, these parasitic genetic elements have acted like an accelerator for adaption due to two core features: being highly mobile within the genome once activated (and if still intact enough to reintegrate) and usually carrying strong gene promoters (usually controlled by cellular stress). Problem being, these sequences are still in most cases &quot;parasitic junk&quot; and get epigenetically silenced by default. Now some of them however carry a feature which in the case of a DNA double strand break (so DNA stress roughly speaking) prevents the silencing of their sequence after the chromatin has been &quot;opened&quot; for repair (this btw does play an active role in the terminal differentiation of some cell types) ... keeping them perpetually active and potentially disrupting, triggering further &quot;control mechanisms&quot; within the cell like senescence or apoptosis which contribute to aging.

So, on the basis of the techies&#039; own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development, it&#039;s safe to say that the life-expectancies of human-derived entities, such as man-machine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines, will actually be quite short.

Most untranslated regions are transposons, some of which have transcriptional potential of endonucleases, and some have the potential to transpose, via copy and paste mechanism (or cut and paste, but those are more rarely intact).<br>Over all, the most important factor of ageing is probably transposos, and the largest problem with this, is they show such high polymorphism, that it&#039;s almost impossible to target them. But if we actually have discovered the global activating mechanism, we can target and silence transposons globally.<br>My boss asked me not to say much untill the paper is in print, lest we be scooped, but it&#039;s some really interesting stuff and it could be high impact.

All that matters is that you passed it. Your ACT/SAT score is something we paid attention to but your GED score is not a proxy for high school GPA. Some schools will ding you for having a GED instead of a high school diploma since they can&#039;t plug the GED into their formulas like they could your GPA. You&#039;re probably shut out of most of the best universities unless your a desired minority and can spin a good story about how you were oppressed and overcame it. But most regional schools will be open to you with a reasonable ACT/SAT score. Do well your first year or two of college and you can transfer to a better school if you wish. <br>Taking Michigan as an example, passing the GED, regardless of score, and getting a decent ACT score will get you into Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Central Michigan but not the University of Michigan or Michigan Tech. Michigan State is in a weird state of flux right now and apparently have lowered their standard because they&#039;re hurting for money and need more students paying tuition. Your state probably has a similar roster of schools in a similar hierarchy. <br>One thing you absolutely positively don&#039;t want to do is fall into the for-profit trap. These schools spend most of their funds on marketing to convince people like you that state schools are going to turn you down but that they&#039;re willing to give you a chance (as long as you have student loan money). The quality of for-profit school is pretty bad, even those with regional accreditation. The costs are high because they know kids with student loan money don&#039;t care about the price.

So here is what I&#039;ll do: define multiplication, and then, using induction, prove the properties you mentioned. The key idea is that when we say m * n, we mean &quot;the sum of n parcels equal to m&quot;. More precisely, for every natural number m, let [math]f_m: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}[/math] be defined as [math]f_m(p) = p + m[/math] so that [math]m \\cdot (n + 1) = (f_m)^n(m)[/math], where (f_m)^n is f_m iterated with itself n times. You might argue that this is just as arbitrary as the properties I am trying to prove, but I would disagree: the definition of m * (n + 1) is just the translation of &quot;the sum of n+1 parcels equal to m&quot; to the mathematical language. <br><br>Now with the definition of multiplication in mind, we see that [math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[\\math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]. This is really the heart of the first property. Now, the proof is as follows: let X be the set of natural numbers p such that (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p for every natural number m, n. I already have proved that 1 is in X above. Then, suppose p is in X, we will prove that (p+1) is also in X:<br><br>[math]\\begin{align}(m + n)\\cdot(p + 1)&amp;= (m+n)\\cdot p + (m +n) \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + n \\cdot p + m + n \\\\&amp;= m \\cdot p + m + n \\cdot p + n \\\\&amp;=m\\cdot(p+1)+n\\cdot(p+1) \\end{align}[/math]<br><br>There, I used the hypothesis that p is in X and the addition properties. We can conclude, by induction, that X = N. So we have just proved the first property. Oh fuck, I am not proving the second one, fuck it, but it just as easy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 80 iq retard</span>", "time": 1673916393, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130153, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130148</a><br>[math]m\\cdot n = (f_m)^{n-1}(m)[/math] and thus [math]m\\cdot (n+1) = (f_m)((f_m)^{n-1}(m)) = (f_m)(m\\cdot n) = m \\cdot n + m[/math]", "time": 1673916529, "resto": 15107772}, {"no": 15130157, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are any of you guys like, professional mathematicians or have made a career out of math?<br>I kinda went NEET mode for 3 years...

These experiments involved a range of research topics, including studying disease, survival in extreme conditions, and equipment testing. The experiments often endangered the health of the COs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Minnesota Starvation Study was divided into four phases: A twelve-week baseline control phase; a 24-week starvation phase, causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of his pre-starvation body weight; and 2 recovery phases, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried. The first rehabilitative stage was restricted by eating 2,000\u20133,000 calories a day. The second rehab phase was unrestricted letting the subjects eat as much food as they would like.</span><br>These studies returned valuable data that no ethics board would allow during peacetime.

Genuis is a curious and poorly understood thing that is often accompanied by some mild illness. However, you can&#039;t use people like newton as an example against selection for intelligence. Firstly, genuis is thought to be the product of mutation between two intelligent (healthy) parents that produces a person with outlier high iq. His father was a prosperous and wealthy farmer of high social standing. Given the correlation between wealth and intelligence of 0.8 its fairly safe to assume that Newtons late father was an, at least reasonably, intelligent man. His mother was the daughter of a butcher (if I recall correctly?) an esteemed profession at the time which would have required intelligence to be successful in.

If you look this up you&#039;ll find Google telling you the opposite, but it&#039;s not true. Given this trend you&#039;d expect the average IQ in England to be around 85 in the next 100 years. Given immigration from the middle east and Africa, we can expect this date to arrive much sooner. Now tell me, what is the probability that you find a person with an IQ of 140+ (the rough boundary of genuis) in a country such as Trinidad where the average iq is in fact 85? Your theory purports that if we just let more low iq people fill the world and lower average iqs well get more genuises despite the fact that that the probability of genuis falls faster than populations grow.

Aerodynamics is an active area of research and even today we have very little understanding of the mathematical details of how flight works or how air turbulence works. I&#039;m less knowledgeable about the other topics, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s still a lot we don&#039;t know about these other subjects. For instance, in color vision we still don&#039;t know whether vision is best described by an opponent-process theory, a trichromatic theory, or some other theory. The point here being that we don&#039;t need to understand something perfectly in order to make useful practical progress within that domain. Prehistoric farmers and ancient Roman architects certainly didn&#039;t understand biology or Newtonian physics, but they were still able to invent agriculture and deisgn buildings that could stand for thousands of years. This is not a &quot;false equivalence&quot; as you claim. The point, once again, is that we don&#039;t need to fully understand a physical domain in order to make practical technological progress within that domain. People were able to ferment alcohol without understanding how yeast convert carbs to alcohols during anaerobic respiration.

Insulators, particularly, be they natural or artificial, bio-electrical, techno-electrical, or even thermal, are critical for a variety of artificial and natural systems to function properly. If the insulation around our nerves is worn away, it&#039;s called a demyelinating disease. If the insulation between transistors fails, a short is created and a computer chip may be temporarily or permanently corrupted. Since the physical properties of insulators are determined by the orientation of atoms and their electrons, most people do not worry that these insulators may suddenly cease to function reliably. The immutability of these materials, of course, is not a given. External magnetic fields, for example, can be used to enhance or block conduction.

At the center, the magnetic force is maximal and this intense force slows the flow of the energy. As an electron passed through the center of the graphene layer, the magnetism of electrons orbiting the carbons, poetically, much like the electrons in the NVG itself, diminish the neutrino contents of the electrons. Once an electron begins to emerge through the other side of the layer, its electrical and magnetic energy is mostly depleted and what is left of the particle is easily swept up in the orbit of carbon atoms and can lead to resonance events, occasionally leading to heating of an insulator.

In brief, the activation of such a mechanism completely depletes the contents of electrons (neutrinos) within a mechanism by deliberately causing electrons flowing through the device to bisect the magnetic fields generated by the flow of other electrons (forced to spin at 90 degree angles relative to trajectory) on parallel tracks within a series of convolutions. This deficit of neutrinos forces neutrinos from electrons in a large surrounding area to flood toward the vacuum. In this case, the deficit created in the electrons that comprise electrical insulators causes their magnetic output to decrease in proportion with their electrical charge&#039;s temporary depletion.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw <br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool. <br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673942251870097, "time": 1673942251, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "please keep the /sfg/ content in the /sfg/ thread", "time": 1673943506, "resto": 15130438}, {"no": 15130884, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:34:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130848</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeorids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power. <br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him.

The question seems to involve the possible limits of rational inquiry or perhaps even of determinism and completeness of systems ala godel. On a personal level, the question tickles my fancy for its seems a way of priming the subconscious pump. Given the possibility space of some topic, including those questions which are &quot;just&quot; outside your awareness, actively engaging in free association I get the sense of &quot;firmness&quot; or &quot;relatedness&quot; of some grouping of associations. From here I might ask what types of answers those questions may submit and what forms they take, and interestingly a sense of distance from what I know. The feeling is literally one of tickling or feeling a pull in a certain direction and contining to allow your thoughts to churn round that kernel. This all seems just an instance of the creative process in general; fumbling around in the dark until the proverbial lightbulb turns on. But nobody really knows from whence comes the creative impluse. In short, it boils down to Immersion, Ponder,...Profit. It&#039;s a mystery...It&#039;s a mystery. So, the relevance to your prompt could be the answer to the question, were you to receive a tool with no known purpose, to what extent would you appreiciate its usefulness or beauty? Would not the answer depend on how similar it is to what you already knew or could conjure from that possibility space? Is there some measure by which we could formalize when technology/ideas/forms proceed from the mundane to magic? Given the current and future state of AI, the question will need answering.

Huge problem that Indian politicians and academics talk about all the time. Indians are the single most successful group of people after Jews in the US, and it&#039;s not because they are allowed to flourish anymore here than back there, but more so because they come here only if they were already flourishing back there. Unlike Mexicans, the process of immigration is tough and back-breaking for most of the world, European, Asians and Africans included (yes even Africans, Nigerians are the most educated and one of the most successful groups here). Hence, only the already rich and/or highly educated ones end up here, and they tend to be quite smart on average compared to the rest of the populace. In the end, it&#039;s the illegals that are stupid, hencewhy African immigrants to Europe are way stupider than African immigrants (not African Americans) in the US, and why Hispanics tend to be low IQ since they are illegals as well. Most non-hispanic immigrant groups do significantly better than whites in the US. As for Indians, only the creme of the crop comes here. They have almost one and a half billion people, so it just happens that there population of the &#039;creme of the crop&#039; is much larger than most other groups. Of course superior western Institutions help with nurturing the talent that we select out and allow to immigrate, as they would have likely been not realized back home in pooland. In the end, any Indian that can, leaves India, and it tends to be higher IQ people who do that, at least to the US.

Emissions compliance reduces torque and available power but also reduces emissions. This has been known since day one. Society decided long ago that it was better to reduce emissions than increase diesel horsepower. This is especially true when diesel-electric trucks have more available power anyway, as their available torque is not governed by engine speed. This is why all heavy duty applications ie construction equipment, agricultural tractors, railroads and ships all moved to diesel-electric setups. Electric drivelines also allow for gensets, which do increase available torque, and have lower emissions than a comparably huge diesel motor anyway.<br><br>As for the &quot;why&quot;, emissions devices slow the flow of exhaust out the engine. This slows the engine down and reduces power. Diesel trucks often do this intentionally through a jake brake as a means to brake the vehicle without applying the wheel braking system, which increases safety and reduces wear on the normal brake pads. This can also be done through shifting and, thanks to advances in automatic transmissions, is how most large trucks do it now as all large trucks come with automatic transmissions standard. Jake brakes are still often required by many companies anyway and many drivers just leave it on as it will automatically stop the truck if the driver does not touch the accelerator.

Linear algebra is about is studying functions on a set [math] X [/math] that output real numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers, etc. Then because the output is a real, rational complex number, if you fix [math] x\\in X [/math], and have suitably valued functions [math] f,g [/math] on [math] X [/math], then [math] f(x), g(x) [/math] are numbers of the given type and you can add them together [math] f(x) + g(x) [/math] to define function addition that is the function [math] f+g[/math] is defined by [math] (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) [/math] and you can multiply [math] r\\cdot f(x) [/math] to get another number so you can define the new function [math] rf [/math] by [math] (rf)(x) = rf(x) [/math]. And that&#039;s linear algebra. The abstract theory in fact is equivalent to just talking about functions with these two operations and all the theory around linear algebra can be derived from this perspective. <br><br>This perspective also yields a canonical basis, the characteristic functions [math] \\chi_z [/math] for each [math] z\\in X [/math] which are defined by: [math] \\chi_z(x) = 0 [/math] if [math] x\\not=z[/math] and [math] \\chi_z(x) = 1 [/math] if [math] x=z[/math] and it is obvious that all functions are unique combinations of characteristic functions.<br><br>Finite dimensional vector spaces are just talking about functions on the first [math] n [/math] natural numbers, so [math] X = \\{1,...n \\} [/math]. So our vectors are represented by <br><br>[math] f = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ \\vdot \\\\ x_n\\end{bmatrix} [/math] <br><br>as we simply list the outputs in order with [math] x_1 = f(1),..., x_n = f(n) [/math], or [math] f= x_1 \\chi_1 + ... + x_n \\chi_n [/math] in our canonical basis.", "time": 1673892038, "resto": 15121310}, {"no": 15129370, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:48:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129154</a><br>i also did CS so the answer has always just been keep brute forcing it until it clicks.

The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate. Abnormal ECGs were obtained in 51 (1.0%) of the students, of which 1 was diagnosed with mild myocarditis and another 4 were judged to have significant arrhythmia. None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously. Using these five students as a positive outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were 100% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac symptoms are common after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but the incidences of significant arrhythmias and myocarditis are only 0.1%. The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect but cost effect needs further discussed. What is Known: \u2022 The incidence of cardiac adverse effects was reported to be as high as 1.5 per 10 000 persons after the second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in the young male population based on the reporting system. What is New: \u2022 Through this mass ECG screening study after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine we found: (1) The depolarization and repolarization parameters (QRS duration and QT interval) decreased significantly after the vaccine with increasing heart rate; (2) the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%; (3) The serial ECG screening method has high sensitivity and specificity for significant cardiac adverse effect.</span><br><br>I wonder why OP left this out?", "time": 1673756801, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125365, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>what&#039;s your point?", "time": 1673757512, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125389, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:51:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125338</a><br>meds.", "time": 1673758286, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125427, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15120797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15120797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but they&#039;ll be a lot less trusting.</span><br>that&#039;s a sign of intelligence. <br><br>Never trust authority figures.", "filename": "Joker World", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 422, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673759020239688, "time": 1673759020, "md5": "9U6pwGb5wPbnN+thWf9Fqg==", "fsize": 39430, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125432, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:05:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125197</a><br>kek!", "filename": "Vax Song", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1060, "h": 1298, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673759122894624, "time": 1673759122, "md5": "bEbpEAOlMIE/YaOqG4V3Zw==", "fsize": 217959, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125467, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15125365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125365</a><br><a href=\"#p15125389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15125389</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;17</span>% have cardiac symptoms guys!!!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis and significant arrhythmia are 0.02% and 0.08%;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of the patients needed to be admitted to hospital and all of these symptoms improved spontaneously.</span><br>Cope.", "time": 1673761619, "resto": 15116704}, {"no": 15125473, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:49:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I unironically love the whole viruses aren&#039;t real gimmick and have been posting it a bunch everywhere.

If you invented an organism that never aged, all the individuals would die from cancer eventually. <br><br>How fast your cells turn over (to repair injuries) determines your likelihood of getting cancer per year. More cell divisions = more chances to get cancer. But fewer cell divisions means slower or fewer types of repair. Humans don&#039;t regrow chopped off limbs because having that ability would confer more cancer than benefit. <br><br>Cells invented a way to make cancer rarer, which is to keep track of how many splits a cell line has done, and self-destruct if it goes over the limit. Every cell in your body essentially has a number of reproductions it can do which are going to last your whole life. Any group of cells that decides to reproduce uncontrollably will just hit the limit sooner and die without getting very large. In order for malignant cancer to happen, a single cell needs to randomly get two mutations at once: one to make it start splitting uncontrollably, and one to make it lose the self-destruct failsafe mechanism. This makes malignant cancer extremely rare compared to benign tumors (which happen constantly to everyone).<br><br>The natural lifespan is the result of an optimization of these variables: how fast do cells divide and how many times to we let them divide before they hit the limit and self-destruct.

How do our offspring start without the accumulated DNA damage? That is because the cells that make offspring, spermatocytes and oocytes are part of the so called germline, a lineage of cells which separates early on, and is under far stricter regulation and control for DNA damage, and they don&#039;t devide all over the place (which is a core source of damage).<br>So these cell lines make or kids.

That&#039;s different than listening, which is to intake and process the meaning or message of some one or thing specifcally.

A month later, I had to be admitted to the hospital because I was experiencing terrible chest pain.<br><br>After getting my blood drawn, I was told by a nurse that my platelet count was at 2, and that they\u2019d have to admit me to the hospital because my troponin levels were also abnormally high. I don\u2019t remember too much after that but I apparently suffered a transient stroke shortly afterwards.<br>I had to take an insane steroid dosage (60mg) and get platelet transfusions for almost 3 months.

First and foremost, it lacks a sheaf theory, i.e., his method of patching together affine varieties to form abstract varieties is clumsy. Second, his definition of a variety over a base field [math]k[/math] is not intrinsic ; specifically, he fixes some large \u00ab universal \u00bb algebraically closed field [math]\\Omega[/math] and defines an algebraic field over [math]k[/math] to be an algebraic variety over [math]\\Omega[/math] together with a [math]k[/math]-structure.<br>In the late 1950s Grothendieck basically resolved all such difficulties by developing the theory of schemes.", "time": 1673911917, "resto": 15121120}, {"no": 15130250, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)20:42:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15128520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15128520</a><br>Reddit is goyim central.<br>4chan is for based Jews only.", "time": 1673919773, "resto": 15121120}, {"no": 15130304, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:13:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15128144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15128144</a><br>Nice idol worship", "filename": "shadow", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 299, "h": 346, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673921633853167, "time": 1673921633, "md5": "hsElhcKw9S1x7dqJ5MYkMw==", "fsize": 9354, "resto": 15121120}, {"no": 15130311, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:17:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15124535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15124535</a><br>retard", "time": 1673921867, "resto": 15121120}, {"no": 15130335, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:32:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130311</a><br>Lol, guess that&#039;s an extra no", "time": 1673922762, "resto": 15121120}, {"no": 15130452, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)22:52:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15124535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15124535</a><br>A lot of his work in algebraic geometry has paved the way for more specific fields of algebraic geometry to flourish.

But Plato also believed that this is not the whole story. Behind this unreliable world of appearances is a world of permanence and reliability. Plato calls this more real (because permanent) world, the world of \u2018Forms\u2019 or \u2018Ideas\u2019 (eidos/idea in Greek). But what is a Platonic Form or Idea?<br><br>Take for example a perfect triangle, as it might be described by a mathematician. This would be a description of the Form or Idea of (a) Triangle. Plato says such Forms exist in an abstract state but independent of minds in their own realm. Considering this Idea of a perfect triangle, we might also be tempted to take pencil and paper and draw it. Our attempts will of course fall short. Plato would say that peoples\u2019 attempts to recreate the Form will end up being a pale facsimile of the perfect Idea, just as everything in this world is an imperfect representation of its perfect Form. The Idea or Form of a triangle and the drawing we come up with is a way of comparing the perfect and imperfect. How good our drawing is will depend on our ability to recognise the Form of Triangle. Although no one has ever seen a perfect triangle, for Plato this is not a problem. If we can conceive the Idea or Form of a perfect triangle in our mind, then the Idea of Triangle must exist.<br><br>The Forms are not limited to geometry. According to Plato, for any conceivable thing or property there is a corresponding Form, a perfect example of that thing or property. The list is almost inexhaustible. Tree, House, Mountain, Man, Woman, Ship, Cloud, Horse, Dog, Table and Chair, would all be examples of putatively independently-existing abstract perfect Ideas.", "time": 1673894304, "resto": 15128390}, {"no": 15129353, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15129014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15129014</a><br>Plato says that true and reliable knowledge rests only with those who can comprehend the true reality behind the world of everyday experience. In order to perceive the world of the Forms, individuals must undergo a difficult education. This is also true of Plato\u2019s philosopher-kings, who are required to perceive the Form of Good(ness) in order to be well-informed rulers. We must be taught to recall this knowledge of the Forms, since it is already present in a person\u2019s mind, due to their soul apparently having been in the world of the Forms before they were born. Someone wanting to do architecture, for example, would be required to recall knowledge of the Forms of Building, House, Brick, Tension, etc. The fact that this person may have absolutely no idea about building design is irrelevant. On this basis, if you can\u2019t recall the necessary knowledge then you\u2019re obviously not suited to be an architect, or a king. Not everyone is suited to be king in the same way as not everyone is suited to mathematics. Conversely, a very high standard in a particular trade suggests knowledge of its Forms. The majority of people cannot be educated about the nature of the Forms because the Forms cannot be discovered through education, only recalled.<br><br>To explain our relationship to the world of the Forms, in the Republic Plato uses the analogy of people who spend their whole lives living in a cave [see Allegory of the Cave]. All they ever see are shadows on the walls created by their campfire. Compared with the reality of the world of the Forms, real physical objects and events are analogous to being only shadows. Plato also takes the opportunity to use the cave analogy as a political statement.

His job is confirming behaviour/ontological state before making the determination which medication will be best for you, based on your state, relative to the probable brain chemistry. That&#039;s how pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs: They have to do years of testing to prove they are &#039;effective&#039; more often than not, and they verify that through brain chemistry changes relative to changed behaviour. <br><br>In any case: A certain brain chemistry or state does not always align with the perceived, typical behaviour of that brain chemistry. Take for example testosterone and being aggresive: My cousin beat the shit out of his girlfriend and was arrested for domestic abuse. He had medical imaging of his brain done as well as genetic sampling. They found he had very low testosterone levels relative to the typical man his age. I think he even had a a slightly higher estrogen than men his age as well. So he actually didn&#039;t need any medication but rather strict, psychological counceling, since it was not a matter of brain chemistry or embalance, but something personal.

Instead of considering typical political power - the threat of violence via police and military, Foucault coins the term &quot;disciplinary power&quot; which is roughly synonymous with &quot;psychological manipulation&quot;. Foucault is particularly interested in a style of psychological manipulation based on interpersonal interrogation. One party is the &quot;analyst&quot; and the other party is the &quot;subject&quot;. In such a situation, the analyst inevitably gains an ability to control and bully the subject. Foucault believes that this strategy for social power was developed by the Catholic church (e.g the Inquisition) and has now been repossessed by medicine and the social sciences. Moreover, Foucault believes that many ostensibly academic fields - &quot;psychology&quot;, &quot;criminology&quot; and of course &quot;psychiatry&quot; - are a pretense of the implementation of disciplinary power. Essentially, Foucault is arguing that psychiatry doesn&#039;t really study anything; rather, it serves as an opportunity for people to put themselves into the role of &quot;analysts&quot; and manipulate &quot;subjects&quot;. Foucault clarifies that he does not necessarily believe there is a organized conspiracy of psychiatrists manipulating the public - rather psychiatry functions as a &quot;open strategy&quot; for social power that individuals use to achieve dominance in their personal lives. As far as what should be done, it is necessary for us to distinguish which aspects of psychiatry (if any) are legitimate medical advice, and which aspects simply serve as a strategy for acquiring social power.", "time": 1674001106, "resto": 15128627}, {"no": 15133119, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)21:31:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15132811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15132811</a><br>I\u2019m the other Foucault reader itt and I appreciate your summary here, it\u2019s solid.

The main results of are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove all the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

Dunno about shitty countries but in Scandinavia it doesn&#039;t seem like it. I think the main reason for your impression is that contrarians and retards are more entertaining and thus make the news and algorithms in disproportionate numbers. From my point of view working in the field of enzymology it seems like science is chugging on pretty placidly. <br>One thing that might also contribute is that science these days are very much collaborative and specialized efforts. Back in ye olde timely days a scientist must&#039;ve appeared like the holder of all truths. It didn&#039;t take much for the rare individuals who had both extraordinary natural mental gifts and extensive schooling to seem like they knew more than a layman about every subject imaginable. From anatomy, biology and geology to history, engineering, politics and philosophy. To a working class man they might hold a status not unlike sage&#039;s and oracle&#039;s of antiquity. <br>These days though. If you want to pursue a top spot on the list of scientific pioneers it&#039;s all about depth. There is not enough hours in a day to strive for breaking new ground and also have breadth in multiple fields. Some researchers I work or collaborate with are what you would call intellectually gifted, I would guess above 140 IQ and not lower than 125 if you&#039;re the kind who consider that IQ good metrIc. More importantly, they also seek new knowledge and toil conscientiously and persistently more than 70 hours weekly. More than 115 a week if you count the time they spend in their home office&#039;s and time spent on conferences and intercorporate collaboration trips. A few have studied biotech fundementals to a master&#039;s degree for 5 years, then spent 1-3 years interning or assisting research pro bono for established organizations.

Males have the blueprints to become women. The presence of the SRY gene however changes this differentiation into male.

I envision filling up the depots will happen in 2 ways: 1: dedicated tankers. 2: excess capacity will always be filled with propellant (or materials for the prop depot). For example, if starship has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and is launching a 100 tonne satellite to LEO, the ship would fill the remaining 50 tonnes with propellant to top up the depot.<br><br>Spherical tanks would be best because they give the most volume per surface area. A way to make these would be to bring up lots of standardized sections (such as a bunch of triangles to make a 20-sided-die shape, an isocahedron). These triangle pieces would be welded by robot into the correct shape -- the robot would have multiple arms, some with electromagnets to hold the pieces at the correct angle while welding. After the isocahedron is assembled, it&#039;s filled with an incompressible fluid and a small explosive charge. The explosive is set off, popping out the steel into a perfect sphere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96y<wbr>hdnhPxAw [Embed]<br><br>The sphere could then be covered with additional layers for micrometeor protection-- could be overwrapped with fiberglass/carbon, or additional shells of welded steel.<br><br>Multiple spheres could be joined into one massive structure, at least one sphere per type of propellant. These spheres would be sandwiched between 2 parallel planes: the sun-side would have solar panels to shade the tanks and generate power. The shady side would have heat exchangers to keep the propellants cool.<br><br>There are several possible ways to pump the propellant. A system of this size can&#039;t easily use ullage burns, so spinning the tanks and collecting the fluid using centrifugal scoops might work. Another way would be to have a bellows that inflate inside the tank and squeeze the fluid out.", "filename": "depot", "ext": ".png", "w": 2057, "h": 963, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1673944551742642, "time": 1673944551, "md5": "hGF9CAqAYIihcT16JjAX4g==", "fsize": 116826, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130891, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130886</a><br>And: how to stop leaks, specifically from micrometeoroids?<br><br>One method is to have balloons filled with some kind of sealant in them, floating around inside the propellant tanks. If a leak happens, a balloon gets sucked to the hole and partially get sucked through, popping in the process. The balloon fabric plus the slimy sealant inside harden and seal the leak-- the hardening would be caused by exposure to hard vacuum, or exposure to the propellant.<br><br>Alternatively, the gap between layers of the concentric shells of the tank could be filled with a sealant, like self-sealing fuel tanks.<br><br>I don&#039;t think spinning the whole depot would be necessary or a good idea. If the method of tapping the propellant is with centrifugal force, then spinning the tanks individually would be superior to the whole depot spinning. You wouldn&#039;t need to worry about a wobbling/unbalanced massive torus if a tank is fuller than another. Another advantage to having the tanks themselves spinning is they could be spinning in different axes, so they&#039;d essentially act as really big reaction control wheels, so you could rotate the depot using only electrical power.<br>Having the depot stationary would also make space walks FAR safer -- if an astronaut got flung off a spinning station, he would need a serious rocket with a lot of delta v to go rescue him. Compared to a fixed station where an accidentally untethered astronaut could get back with just a few m/s delta v in a small package like the MMU/SAFER.", "time": 1673944712, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130916, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hello please checking out Dream Chaser DC-200 series on Vulcan Centaur that I drew :)", "filename": "VC DC-200 final no watermark", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2400, "h": 3600, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673945661383245, "time": 1673945661, "md5": "M9Bx/nLbLyNqzpZOWB6klg==", "fsize": 1414013, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130917, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:54:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130778</a><br>Probably going to be dismissed after bungling the 5G transition again kek", "time": 1673945696, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130943, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;wake up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;check /sfg/ after weeks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starship STILL hasn&#039;t launched</span>", "time": 1673947191, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15130952, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:30:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15130943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15130943</a><br>Soon\u2122.

However, the planes&#039; developers, Takuo Toda (see paper plane world records) and fellow enthusiast Shinji Suzuki, an aeronautical engineer and professor at Tokyo University, postponed the attempt after acknowledging it would be all but impossible to track the planes during their week-long journey to Earth, assuming any of them survived the searing descent.

If one of the planes survived to Earth, it would have made the longest flight ever by a paper plane, traversing the 250 mi./400 km. vertical descent. In a test in Japan in February 2008, a prototype about 2.8 inches long and 2 inches wide survived Mach 7 speeds and temperatures reported to be 200\u00b0C in a hypersonic wind tunnel for 10 seconds. Materials designed for use in conventional reentry vehicles, including ceramic composites, withstand temperatures on the order of 2200\u00b0C.[6] The 30 cm planes were to have been made from heat-resistant paper treated with silicon.</span><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper<wbr>_planes_launched_from_space<br>Musk should do this, offer prize money for any found", "filename": "John Frassanito upgraded space shuttle a", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 756, "h": 539, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1673968479795228, "time": 1673968479, "md5": "SvTMP0KnN3+kpNaK66QLfg==", "fsize": 43955, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15131583, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)10:55:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fresh OIG report on NASA has dropped<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Given its deep space ambitions and current budget profile, NASA will be unable to achieve its long-term Artemis objectives without effectively incorporating international partner cost management strategies.&quot;</span><br><br>https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-23-004<wbr>.pdf", "filename": "BANG3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1933, "h": 1289, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673970955658512, "time": 1673970955, "md5": "dgCoyz3ZWQ3D0ulPVoXoJw==", "fsize": 278500, "resto": 15129948}, {"no": 15131603, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15131583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15131583</a><br>Or just contract then to SpaceX to cut cost.

College is a huge financial investment, but then without it, you stand to earn FAR less money over the course of your lifetime than if you have one. <br><br>For example, going to Law school for 3 years at a top 50 Law school in America will put you 200-300k in debt, easy. But then we&#039;re to remark, if you are top 20% of your class at those schools, you are likely to be recruited by a top law firm or corporate law division where the starting salary is usually around 160,00k, sometimes more if you&#039;ve internshipped and networked well during your summers. <br><br>So 300k sounds like a ton. 3-5 years working at a top firm with that investment, you will have paid off all of it. My friend graduated from Georgetown Law Center in 2020, I don&#039;t know where he was ranked in his class, but he was recruited by JP Morgan. He makes 220,000 a year there, and he has already paid off his $280,000 student loans in two years.

Lawyers run Movie studios, Baseball teams, work in politics, finance, hold top positions at Universities, etc. IMO a JD degree is the best degree to get right now if, first of all, you like law and reasoning, but second if you are personable, pleasent, and have some level of charm about you, and are able to market your abilities relative to the degree discipline.
