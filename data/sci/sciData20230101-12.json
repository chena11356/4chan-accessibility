You probably know that already but I think that&#039;s going to be extremely difficult to overcome if not impossible in a lot of compiled code cases. <br><br>Where it might work is with like you said JavaScript and other interpreted code where the code is only partially renamed during minification. Or if they have access to sourcemaps or other assets. Like unbundling something built with webpack, but even then the original filenames are usually lost and bundled files are referenced by numbers.

Take my words with a grain of salt though, I am only a phd student myself (3rd year)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only issue is that his lab is pretty new (currently 3 PhD students working under him and the lab was established in 2019-20)</span><br>That is sufficient for a small lab, I work for a lab/research group not much larger than this. Also, if he is innovative and has good funding lined up, it could be worthwhile. Also, younger professionals typically are more ambitious than well established profs because they still have to prove themselves, and are more hands-on too (but this may not necessarily be the case with everyone). In my opinion, having a mentor actually work with you/assist/advise you is more important than having a fancy name on the paperwork, even if that name can open more doors for you later on, but thats just my opinion. The newer professional will likely be able to help you develop actual skills/know-how but will not have the name recognition, while the more established professional will leave you on your own but will have better name recognition and connections.<br>Also, consider the time commitments, because face-to-face communications is very valuable - would you rather have someone who can meet with you 1-2 hours weekly or even more time per week, or someone who can give you 30 minutes max once in 2 weeks or a month?<br>Also, I cannot stress this enough - it really helps if you are on good terms with your advisor and like them as a person, than can make a big difference - do you like this guy?

There is not much novelty here in my opinion. First problem that some other anons pointed out is that they&#039;re data-driven.

First problem is that they&#039;re data-driven. A better method - which is at the core of DL research - is building the biases you want (in this case constraints from a PDE) into the architecture.

We analyzed data from 309 medical students who prepared for a high-stakes exam using a digital learning platform. Using log files from the learning platform, we assessed students\u2019 level of knowledge throughout the exam-preparation phase and their average performance in mock exams that were completed shortly before the final exam. The results showed that test anxiety did not predict exam performance over and above students\u2019 knowledge level as assessed in the mock exams or during the exam-preparation phase. Leveraging additional ambulatory assessment data from the exam-preparation phase, we found that high trait test anxiety predicted smaller gains in knowledge over the exam-preparation phase. Taken together, these findings are incompatible with the hypothesis that test anxiety interferes with the retrieval of previously learned knowledge during the exam.</span><br><span

If you don&#039;t have any experience with university yet and have to decide what to do it is easy to fall into the trap of associating majors directly with what you will work on later in your life. Mechatronical systems are cool as hell and having an understanding of all the parts sounds great, but in practice you will probably just end up doing one niche part for some bigger system and your goal should be to optimize your chances to get into more interesting niches and not to get an understanding of as many niches as possible.

With a deeper knowledge of math compared to the average engineer they can often get assigned the more &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; tasks. I put those in quotes because that of course is highly subjective, but in many fields you will realize that in order to understand and work with the more elementary methods, you need to have a really good understanding of math first.<br>Take for example cryptography as a really interesting sub-field of cybersecurity.

If the outermost layer of a metallic object can be forced to take on a crystalline structure and these crystals can be made to twist so that in the outermost layer, rather than a smooth surface, on a nanoscopic scale, the metal has a series of V-shaped grooves.

A much stronger force would counteract these chance alignments, usually keeping the oxygen in water a fair distance from the metal and, at minimum, preventing these &quot;nested chevrons&quot; from aligning. Only with these alignments is it possible for an oxygen to be liberated from an H2O after water is pushed with sufficient force into a metallic surface.<br><br>The question then becomes one of how to efficiently generate these configurations of atoms in steel, for instance. In the case of most metals, I recommend ultrasonic bombardment of the metal via water during the cooling process.

Now, we have to look up the average mating session of a lonely shotacon woman. According to a paper made by H. Kojimbo, the number would be at least 4 hours, and it depends on the amount of time that has passed since the last intercourse of a woman. Since the problem gives us incomplete information, we can only assume that the last time Mrs. Tanaka saw her husband was also the last time they had sex. 6 months of chastity means that the session would take 6 hours. We now only have to calculate the time it takes for both of them to arrive at a location of the intercourse. For the simplicity of math, I assume that the intercourse has started right where they met, meaning that the time equals zero. This way, we find our answer: Takashi-kun would arrive home at 7 PM.

Look into the GMO cotton seed suicides in India, farmers forced into debt to keep rebuying seeds. Did you know that farmers can&#039;t even keep seeds from GMO plants they grow on their own land? It&#039;s patent infringement. They have to hand them all over to the big corporation that wants to monopolize the food industry for power over the people, then often go into debt to buy them back just to reseed their fields from crops they grew on their own land. These GMO companies have even sued seed cleaners for providing a service to farmers, and they never even did it for GMO farmers. They&#039;ll also sue any farmers whose lands are polluted by no fault of their own with their GMO seeds, imagine how easy it would be to sow GMO seeds by drone or something if you really wanted to do that to steal someones lands via courts and lawyers. This is also how they monopolize arable land, by forcing farmers into debt every year and then I could also get into the money changers of the private central banks of the world.<br><br>Or you could mindlessly believe everything the television tells you to believe and not look into a single thing I mentioned.", "filename": "agenda-21-david-dees-1200x873", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1672539123549463, "time": 1672539123, "md5": "XKuvmW64Tt5WXsrTjkYGqw==", "fsize": 111906, "resto": 15087821}, {"no": 15091608, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15091099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15091099</a><br>How is it a scam?

I think there&#039;s other factors that probably play a bigger role on overall happiness more than IQ. One big thing I think is having goals to work towards. These should be goals that you can actively work on and think about, not goals like I&#039;m going to buy some video game, not bucket list kind of goals, they should be goals that take up at least some of your spare time. Like starting a small side business outside of work on your spare time. Just that after dealing with depression a lot in the past I noticed I could basically ignore the depression by being busy and working on things I want to work on and overall it made me happier because it makes life feel like less of a boring repetitive grind. Right now I&#039;m just working on a website that&#039;s like a product where I can sell subscriptions etc and it gives me a lot to think about and plan and maybe I&#039;ll meet some people from it etc. And it&#039;s like one bigger goal that I can split into lots of smaller goals so it feels like I&#039;m constantly achieving stuff.

Outside of the hard sciences everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Hell, even some area of the hard sciences are highly suspect (e.g. String Theory). Many people, including those in scientific fields, have a very cargo cult approach to science. To them science is something published in a respectable enough journal and with p&lt;0.05. The soft sciences have been a joke for decades and are effectively just a propaganda arm for the Party. I don&#039;t think scientific inquiry will grind to a halt, but it will slow down, and some research will become verboten in the west. This is a list of things that I think we will not research anymore in the near future:<br>- nuclear fission for power generation (The money is on fusion now)<br>- heritability of human traits and in general everything that could show inherent disparity in abilities between humans and between human groups<br>- gain of function research (just kidding lol)<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672337652, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086184, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:15:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15086180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15086180</a><br>I&#039;m especially mad about the current situation of nuclear research. I can sort of accept the pozzing of research that goes directly against the dogmas of the woke religion, but the corruption of nuclear research really shows how power driven scientists have become. To the layman the recent breakthrough in fusion sounds like a great achievement but to someone who has actually mastered elementary school mathematics it only shows how scientist would lie (mostly by omission, but that&#039;s still a lie) only to gain funding and status for themselves. We could phase out fossil fuels in less than a decade, for electricity generation at least, using the nuclear technology we already have. If you want to get fancy you could start building pilot power plants based on the Thorium cycle and/or other new gen reactors. Instead we are funding boondoggles like fusion that will likely not be able to generate useful power for the next few decades. Or pouring money in meme stuff like renewables and hydrogen. To work well science requires a rather high degree of honesty, a degree of honesty that is above the paygrade of most people. Unfortunately I think academia is selecting for ass kissing, grinding and cheating abilities, none of which correlate strongly with honesty. <br><br>2/2", "time": 1672337739, "resto": 15078278}, {"no": 15086206, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)13:25:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15078421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15078421</a><br>you are making the wrong assumptions.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children.

You need a more advanced set of axioms, like Kolmogorov&#039;s (which was made to deal with such problems). It defines the probability sample space omega as a set of all outcomes, with a probability function that maps each to a probability, such that the sum of all elements probability is 1. Events of interest are subsets of the sample space. This permits using probability functions for infinities. <br><br>Any infinite sequence of non zero probability samples has a probability function that approaches zero. But the number of events of interest, ie the cardinality of the set of events of interest, is infinite. <br><br>But as can be seen from <a href=\"#p15089061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089061</a> <a href=\"#p15089069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089069</a> <a href=\"#p15089077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15089077</a>, infinity cannot be thought of as an integer. Paradoxes also arise from infinity when rigorously defined. For example, the cardinality of the set of all even numbers is not smaller than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers. <br><br>Strictly speaking, the axiomatic understanding is that it is probability 0, given that its the probability of the sample space minus non infinitely recurring heads at some point, which is 1 - 1.

This has cost many tens of billions of dollars. I don&#039;t see particle accelerators being sustainable at this rate, as in, maybe it&#039;s time to go back to the drawing board on how we probe the depths of the quantum world.

I distinguish between social forces by their actuality and virtuality. The actuality is objective, not a matter of attribution: you acted, responding not to fear or laziness, nor merely rational self interest, but to the whole. The attributions of fear and laziness are virtual, having a reality but no actuality of their own: there is no direct &#039;act&#039; of fear or laziness or self interest. I agree that the mere existence of &quot;social forces&quot; is not very substantial, but that has no baring on the evident fact. It seems OP is opportunistically denying social existence, and I&#039;d be here for it if there were a coherent case. <br><br>For me, objectivity is foremost individual. I can know the consensus and theories, the reality, but find it abstract fantasy unless observable on the grounds of fundamental ontology. Note that my motivations are far more religious than scientific~<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This doctrine is the direct negation of the theory that religion is primarily a social fact. Social facts are of great importance to religion, because there is no such thing as absolutely independent existence. You cannot abstract society from man; most psychology is herd-psychology.
