Any praises or critizisms?<br><br>Longevity diet:<br><br>1. Eat a mostly vegan diet with some fish: Strive for a 100 percent<br>plant-and fish-based diet, but limit fish consumption to two or three meals a<br>week and avoid fish with high mercury content. After age sixty-five to<br>seventy, if you start losing muscle mass, strength, and weight, add more fish<br>and fruit and introduce animal-based foods like eggs, cheese, and yogurt<br>made from sheep\u2019s or goat\u2019s milk.<br>2. Consume low but sufficient proteins: Consume approximately 0.31 to<br>0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If you weigh 100<br>pounds, that is about 31 to 36 grams of protein per day, of which 30 grams<br>should be consumed in a single meal to maximize muscle synthesis. If you<br>weigh 200 pounds and have 35 percent body fat, 60 grams of protein per day<br>are instead sufficient, considering that it is the lean body mass that utilizes<br>most of the proteins. Protein intake should be raised slightly after age sixtyfive to seventy in individuals who are losing weight and muscle.<br>3. Minimize bad fats and sugars, and maximize good fats and<br>complex carbs: The diet should be rich in \u201cgood\u201d unsaturated fats,<br>including those from salmon, almonds, and walnuts, but very poor in \u201cbad\u201d<br>saturated, hydrogenated, and trans fats. Likewise, the diet should be rich in<br>complex carbohydrates, such as those provided by whole bread and<br>vegetables, but poor in sugars and limited in pasta, rice, white bread, fruit<br>juices, and fruits containing carbohydrates that are easily converted into<br>simple sugars. Finally, the diet should be low in animal proteins but<br>relatively high in vegetable proteins, in order to minimize the former\u2019s<br>negative effects on diseases and maximize the latter\u2019s nourishing effects.<br><br>[1/3]", "filename": "imagen_2022-11-24_192143165", "ext": ".png", "w": 1494, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1669314111172702, "time": 1669314111, "md5": "V8C7W4Ef9xUkNmBWh5LBdg==", "fsize": 939619, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "longevity-thread-valter-longo-edition", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 15010553, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:22:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "4.

Eat twice a day plus a snack: Unless your waist circumference and<br>body weight are in the normal or low range, it is best to eat breakfast plus<br>one other meal a day and one low-calorie, low-sugar, nourishing snack. If<br>your weight or muscle mass is too low, then eat three meals a day plus a<br>snack.<br>7. Time-restricted eating: Restrict your eating to eleven to twelve hours or<br>less per day. For example, if you eat breakfast after 8 a.m., finish dinner<br>before 8 p.m. Shorter periods of feeding (ten hours or less) have been shown<br>to be even more effective in promoting health, but they are much more<br>difficult to comply with and may increase the risk of side effects, such as the<br>formation of gallstones.<br><br>[2/3]", "time": 1669314145, "resto": 15010551}, {"no": 15010555, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:23:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "8.

I noticed a red mark on my right shin in the shower about a month ago, thought I must have bumped my leg, but didn&#039;t remember bumping it, plus the mark didn&#039;t hurt like a fresh wound would. Looked at it yesterday and realised it&#039;s actually bigger now, tenderer now, and there is a bruise forming around it. Suddenly I think I have skin cancer. I have made a doctor&#039;s appointment in 6 days, but am reading about skin cancer and wondering if I should try to see a doctor sooner. <br><br>All pictures: https://mega.nz/folder/W5VBWQqB#e7e<wbr>R9cA2jUtx1VWf0mL9Lw", "filename": "SAM_2102", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2592, "h": 1944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1669317092614162, "time": 1669317092, "md5": "DPQUoB/qXinQ1+Xj5O+d1A==", "fsize": 712608, "resto": 15004641}, {"no": 15010612, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:13:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15010611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15010611</a><br>You can click on the dots on the image and click &quot;preview&quot; btw to view all the images in browser.", "time": 1669317185, "resto": 15004641}], "last_modified": 1669317185}, {"no": 15009813, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)03:25:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Infinity&#039;s not a number!

The woman in the lab coat is feeding anon twix candybars, and the anon is guessing whether it is the left or right bar. After responding, the woman writes something down in her notebook. Now here&#039;s where the joke really becomes layered. Now anon thinks that the woman is writing down that he&#039;s got 329 consecutive correct guess. But how could anon know what she is writing down? Assuming this is a professional scientist or doctor, she certainly wouldn&#039;t allow him to see what was written down. To complicate matters even more, if you flip the packaging of the twix bars, it would appear that the left and right twix bars have swapped, so it is actually completely arbitrary which twix bar would be &quot;left&quot; and which would be &quot;right&quot;. Now do you notice how the picture beside the text is a gigachad in a straightjacket. This, along with the absurdity of believing himself to be the subject of an experiment of selecting which twix bar is &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; suggests that anon is in fact schizophrenic, and the woman in the lab coat is not performing an experiment regarding twix bars, but she is actually a psychiatrist who is analyzing anon. She is feeding him twix bars because presumably that is what anon likes to eat, and it would be inhumane to starve him. We can assume that whatever she is writing in her notebook is something related to anon&#039;s condition, rather than twix bars.
