Bluetooth uses an antenna to transmit electromagnetic waves with frequencies around 2.4 gigahertz. Performance declines relative to antenna size, just like a telescope, the size of the lens determines how much light it can gather. Bluetooth is already shit because of its small size and energy-efficiency, there is no fucking way an antenna that fits in a module under 0.413mm in size would be able to transmit a signal underground, without even going into how it is powered for months or years from inside a rotting corpse. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;See the Chu-Harrington Limit: for an electrically small antenna, the minimum Q of a lossless antenna is given as Q = (ka)^-3 + (ka)^-1, where k=2*pi/wavelength and a is the radius of the smallest sphere containing the antenna and its current distribution.</span>", "time": 1669565209, "resto": 15014274}, {"no": 15016077, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:22:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15016058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15016058</a><br>first of all you are wrong about the size, and probably right about the transmission capability, however you don&#039;t need it to transmit anything you can use a scanner that read it, but i&#039;m not sure about its ability to read the burned information in this potential case.", "filename": "1654543453", "ext": ".png", "w": 1010, "h": 759, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1669566161443106, "time": 1669566161, "md5": "EikxtmGV9jjL8todGkfLHA==", "fsize": 642738, "resto": 15014274}, {"no": 15016098, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:39:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15016058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15016058</a><br>You have such poor imagination.

The Pyramid itself is a Golden Pyramid (a lot of gold going around I know just try to keep up). It is called this because the triangles that make up this pyramid express the golden ratio (Fibonacci sequence) meaning that the hypotenuse is Phi (1.618). If you divide the perimeter of the pyramid (921.316m) by its height (146.7m) you get 6.28 which is two pi (2\u03c0). It is thought that the Pythagorean Hippasus discovered The Golden Ratio. It is so strange for this structure to be built with these patterns and accuracy; things like 2\u03c0 rads/sec are equal to 1 Hertz: used in frequency and electricity. Where did this math come from: are we just seeing things that aren\u2019t there?<br><br>The golden ratio is an irrational number: meaning it is neither a whole number or a fraction. This shocked many fellow Pythagoreans. Like Pi it is a never ending infinite number which expresses and defines perfect curvature and proportion.

I have had this idea for a while of trying to use subliminal messaging to get more enjoyment out of my job. Recently I read Brave New World, and the talk about hypnopedia flared this up, and I wanted to know how much research there is on this. In my experience, looking for resources on any kind of fringe psychology doesn&#039;t usually amount to anything because for some reason most studies related to this shit have never even heard of the concept of scientific method, but this seems like a common enough / grounded enough idea that maybe someone has tried it properly before.

This can be done through listening to it in low volume, even when doing things like watching video, listening to music, working, doing the dishes, etc. They key here is constant repetition, even (perhaps especially) if the person isn&#039;t doing anything related to the sentences themselves. It is important that the person listens to these sentences without engaging with them intellectually at all, so in this sense, the person being aware of what they are hearing may be undesirable. Even if at first they may not resonate at all with the person, the idea is that, over time, these sentences will be internalized by the person enough that they actually start taking some effect on the personality. And then of course, extend this to sleeping time, using an app or something that beings repetitions after an hour or so, when the person is asleep.<br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "1643493786452", "ext": ".webm", "w": 480, "h": 854, "tn_w": 140, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669506401818152, "time": 1669506401, "md5": "HTV2MP+MfkzVVmenrQ9NEw==", "fsize": 3094694, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "subliminals-mantras-and-hypnopedia", "replies": 6, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 1, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 15014979, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)19:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p15014964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15014964</a><br>You should first see how susceptible you are.
