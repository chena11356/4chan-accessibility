Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating. At this point you\u2019re literally a needle in a haystack, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re fighting anything, you don\u2019t need to pay attention to the game at all.

They tried to make it be more fast paced, yet it can draw out to 40 minutes easily if there aren&#039;t decent team wipes. Pushing a lane means nothing due to how piss easy it is to wave clear. I personally tank inhibitors and towers because they don&#039;t do shit and even a caster and a tank hitting it can take it down in just a few seconds. The items are ok, the jungle item is basically the one from LoL, potions are next to useless due to how long they take to get the full hp/mana.

APB. I remember that shit so much. I was SO hyped for it. I had played a ton of gmod RP growing up (which basically is heavily based around cops vs criminals at the time). So I thought this was going to be that but on steroids. Preordered it. Upgraded my computer for it. I.was.ready. God damn what a disappointment. Performance issues and lack luster combat. I think the biggest issue is they didn&#039;t predict how shitty players can be. The amount of hacking after a few weeks into launch was absolutely insane. The game had like no anti cheat at launch. Griefing was also insane. The ability of players to interact with other players who are in the middle of a mission. Blocking objectives with cars and shit. They tried to fix it and players found a way around it. Completely ruined missions. They also hyped it up to be more open world based and free. Instead it was just &quot;wait around for a mission&quot;. Missions were also pretty meh and frustrating.<br><br>Amazon customization though all around. Loved the radio options + whole music dynamic. And the most fun I had was going on &quot;patrol&quot; as a cop, looking for criminals doing crimes, spotting them, then engaging in a chase. They should&#039;ve built on that dynamic instead of mission spam. <br><br>I still remember the advertisements. With people I think getting tattoos and cutting their hair for a marketing campaign they did for the game. Hopefully they got paid well lol. <br><br>Games still got a small following. Someone bought the IP a few years ago and said they were going to improve everything. Guess the games built on shit code cause things fell apart when they upgraded the engine in testing.

People aren&#039;t wrong when they say trannies have gained a foothold on how the server is operated. They wiggle their way in or some mentally unstable person in the higher ranks converts to one and starts acting irrationally. In 2020, I came back and got in trouble for a name I used for years on there (it was a caveman name where I&#039;d refer to myself by name) and because of what my character looked like (hogan mustache that was red, black skin, and an afro). Never had a problem with this for years, but because their naming convention changed I was permabanned from naming my character differently unless I appealed. Decided to just quit there. Shame since the admins use to do stuff like Ligger uprisings for civil rights.
