Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating. At this point you\u2019re literally a needle in a haystack, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re fighting anything, you don\u2019t need to pay attention to the game at all.

Something needs to come along that offers the same level of enjoyment and the same type of enjoyment. Radio was replaced by TV. Movies took a hit thanks to streaming. Only thing I can think of that would &quot;hit&quot; the current gaming environment is VR exploding. And normal keyboard/mouse/controller games would become the radio, so to speak.

Competitive TF2 is something of a joke honestly, it doesn&#039;t have very wide appeal among the currently existing community and from the very beginning needed to be specifically engineered so that the meta wasn&#039;t completely trashed.

In an esport shitter game, only the highest skill levels are given appeal and the rest are shoved in the garbage bin. You have to care about your team because you are completely reliant on them. Competitive is the entire reason anyone plays, casual is considered a joke and is generally a waste of time to develop for since nobody is interested in playing it for anymore than an hour.

This much is easy to notice, but the true headscratcher is why exactly the audience prefers e-sports trash over good old fun.<br><br>Also part of it is just TF2&#039;s style making things very comedic, like the friendly shit and voiceline spam.

Mabinogi is a fun, once popular little old school Korean MMO from 2004 based around Celtic mythology with many different features. Your character can age, rebirth, eat food and gain weight, play and custom make music, and so much more. You can be anything and do anything all at once with no downsides. From non combat related skills like cooking, tailoring, blacksmithing, trading goods in a commerce, carpentry, etc. to different styles of combat like melee, magic, ninja, archery, puppetry, etc. all on 1 character. Although graphics and gameplay is still a bit dated, even after 14 years the game is still rich in content such as fashion contests, cooking contest, jousting, playing in or viewing large concerts, training pets, and so on and continues to be Nexon&#039;s most generous game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;News and Events</span><br>https://mabinogi.nexon.net/news/all<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALL SERVERS HAVE BEEN MERGED</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many combat talents, life talents, commerce system, field bosses have been revamped</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Hybrid Talents coming called Arcana talents</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11/17/2022</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skill training, Renown, Grandmaster, and Crusader skills will become a lot easier to train(lowered training requirements) </span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Guilds]</span><br>We currently have a guild called Mabigen.

It amplified the factor of games being won at the hero select screen by a million.

Everything else was locked in. It was an arena shooter masquerading as a robot game, in an era where arena shooters are dead. You can&#039;t run an F2P game that has nothing useful to buy in the shop, five maps, six robots, yet somehow also a live action series, a comic, a card game, THREE REBOOTS THAT ALL HAD PROBLEMS, and so much other shit like Siege mode never being balanced, Class C being mostly shit because of the butt wings idea, adding classes that break the game like Technician and Incinerator seven years after release, not committing fully to GunZ movement despite flirting with it for the entire game&#039;s lifespan, and on and on and on. <br>Hawken was great, but it deserved to die. For all the absolutely shit decisions PGI made with MWO, at least their robots are stompy and the customization is deep (enough).", "time": 1669266693, "resto": 761116}], "last_modified": 1669266693}, {"no": 759996, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)14:43:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bro what am I doing wronggggggggggggg<br><br>my teammates are always so fkn bad", "filename": "Screenshot 2022-11-20 132754", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1150, "h": 422, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1669146215064777, "time": 1669146215, "md5": "7KiRRdfKOG2jGoZA7Oqtug==", "fsize": 73989, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "bro-what-am-i-doing-wronggggggggggggg", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 761136, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)23:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p759996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;759996</a><br>shit thread you&#039;re gay", "time": 1669265948, "resto": 759996}, {"no": 761150, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)00:20:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p761136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;761136</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1669267233, "resto": 759996}], "last_modified": 1669267233}, {"no": 715145, "now": "10/02/22(Sun)16:31:41", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Sea of Thieves", "com": "Spooky Halloween Edition<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Captaincy is actually working this time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Season 9 soon with ELo based PvP matchmaking</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adventures and Mysteries are dumb</span><br>Last thread: <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;690408</span>", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1028, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 133, "tim": 1664742701922571, "time": 1664742701, "md5": "Gmm8hDBuPtLS9ZRwvmRM6g==", "fsize": 1794646, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sea-of-thieves", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 528, "images": 70, "omitted_posts": 523, "omitted_images": 68, "last_replies": [{"no": 763254, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)13:19:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stock up sloop for 30 mins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Invade someone</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stuck on black screen for the whole fight</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finally loads to sunken boat</span><br><br>Gee, thanks rare.", "filename": "EyLHBSMXEAAc3z6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 320, "h": 229, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1669486761485707, "time": 1669486761, "md5": "0Emq62Gv3K+lSOcVskn0pA==", "fsize": 12403, "resto": 715145}, {"no": 763271, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)13:30:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p763254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;763254</a><br>Hasn&#039;t happened to me, sounds like a you problem.", "time": 1669487430, "resto": 715145}, {"no": 763787, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)23:03:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p763254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;763254</a><br>Yup, I hate that.
