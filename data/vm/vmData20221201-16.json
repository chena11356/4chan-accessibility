From non combat related skills like cooking, tailoring, blacksmithing, trading goods in a commerce, carpentry, etc. to different styles of combat like melee, magic, ninja, archery, puppetry, etc. all on 1 character. Although graphics and gameplay is still a bit dated, even after 14 years the game is still rich in content such as fashion contests, cooking contest, jousting, playing in or viewing large concerts, training pets, and so on and continues to be Nexon&#039;s most generous game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;News and Events</span><br>https://mabinogi.nexon.net/news/all<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALL SERVERS HAVE BEEN MERGED</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many combat talents, life talents, commerce system, field bosses have been revamped</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Hybrid Talents coming called Arcana talents</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11/17/2022</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skill training, Renown, Grandmaster, and Crusader skills have become a lot easier to train(lowered training requirements) </span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Guilds]</span><br>We currently have a guild called Mabigen.

Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating.

There was a PVE questline but it was just to level you up for PvP and to give you a little bit of flavor context as to what your nation is like and what you are fighting for. Once a month, the players of each nation would elect a nation leader who could set vendor taxes and distribute the nation&#039;s warchest and schedule when wars happened (usually on weekend afternoons). During war, you had hundreds of players pushing into enemy territory and capturing points, people flying ahead to scout out for enemy movements, people infiltrating deep into enemy territory trying to find a spot to hide in and start portalling in reinforcements. You had desperate battles at chokepoints and counter pushes. Eventually one side would reach the gates of the enemy city and there would be a climatic showdown to blow up their mothership. During week days, there were smaller wars over capturable airships and space stations, which functioned as guildhalls for whichever brigade claimed them. Sadly that game was killed off by the implementation of a literal P2W slotmachine that gave you the best armors in the game.<br><br>I am currently playing GW2. WvW is fun in small doses, but there is no flavor. You are not fighting for the Anti-Nationalists against the Imperialists or for the Horde against the Alliance. You&#039;re red team fighting against green and blue team, who are indistinguishable from you in aesthetics, and there is no lore. You don&#039;t feel like you are fighting in the name of your country. You can claim forts in the name of your guild, but you can&#039;t decorate the fort, and the keep gets taken back by the enemy within an hour anyway. Sadly WvW has been forgotten by the dev team and will never become more than what it is now.<br><br>part 1/2", "time": 1669865925, "resto": 737463}, {"no": 767308, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)22:40:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "part 2/2 <a href=\"#p767307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;767307</a><br><br><a href=\"#p763695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;763695</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel like GW2 is for RP/Social players who can&#039;t afford/don&#039;t like the FF14 sub.</span><br>I am subbed to FF14 but I only play when new batch of MSQ drops.
