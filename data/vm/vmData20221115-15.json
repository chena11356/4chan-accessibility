Mabinogi is a fun, once popular little old school Korean MMO from 2004 based around Celtic mythology with many different features. Your character can age, rebirth, eat food and gain weight, play and custom make music, and so much more. You can be anything and do anything all at once with no downsides. From non combat related skills like cooking, tailoring, blacksmithing, trading goods in a commerce, carpentry, etc. to different styles of combat like melee, magic, ninja, archery, puppetry, etc. all on 1 character. Although graphics and gameplay is still a bit dated, even after 14 years the game is still rich in content such as fashion contests, cooking contest, jousting, playing in or viewing large concerts, training pets, and so on and continues to be Nexon&#039;s most generous game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;News and Events</span><br>https://mabinogi.nexon.net/news/all<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALL SERVERS HAVE BEEN MERGED</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many combat talents, life talents, commerce system, field bosses have been revamped</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Hybrid Talents coming called Arcana talents</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11/17/2022</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skill training, Renown, Grandmaster, and Crusader skills will become a lot easier to train(lowered training requirements) </span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Guilds]</span><br>We currently have a guild called Mabigen.

This mod inspired the creator of the game Vintage Story, if you&#039;ve heard of it<br><br>Basically you start off like a caveman, working with stone tools before working your way up to metal ones. Making your first pickaxe (which can only be made out of metal for balancing/progression purposes) is a big deal. It also adds over 20 new passive, neutral, &amp; hostile mobs (which replace the zombies, skeletons, and other fictional enemies), over 20 new types of trees, crops &amp; seeds, stone, dirt &amp; grass, well over 50 new types of plants &amp; flowers, new types of weapons like javelins, a thirst system, completely overhauled terrain generation, and a lot of other stuff to add more variety &amp; a greater degree of realism to the game<br>It also adds over a dozen new systems. To briefly go over just one of them, the ambient temperature system: it doesn&#039;t directly affect players through health loss or anything, but it does affect where crops can/can&#039;t be planted, suddenly makes crops destroy themselves if the area is too hot or too cold for too long, and different crops can withstand different temperature ranges. It also governs where saplings can/can&#039;t be planted, etc.<br>Most other new systems are similarly complex, such as an overhauled smithing system for crafting things like tool heads &amp; weapon blades, a nutrient system that affects crop growth &amp; the player&#039;s max health, and more", "time": 1668385965, "resto": 753369}, {"no": 754466, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Only TFC? kinda lame", "time": 1668535984, "resto": 753369}, {"no": 754483, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:01:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.18.2 TFC</span><br>what in the fuck", "filename": "1620152927562", "ext": ".png", "w": 259, "h": 219, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1668538901145410, "time": 1668538901, "md5": "DyqimJoXNKFtVoy9MaMR4Q==", "fsize": 103074, "resto": 753369}], "last_modified": 1668538901}, {"no": 736657, "now": "11/02/22(Wed)14:11:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "New World", "com": "YEAH IM THINKING WE BACK NEW WORLD BROS", "filename": "SAVED9", "ext": ".png", "w": 933, "h": 922, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 247, "tim": 1667412666287953, "time": 1667412666, "md5": "a52QrX6gLqZqEx9zLcxMdQ==", "fsize": 320219, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "new-world", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 238, "images": 24, "omitted_posts": 233, "omitted_images": 24, "last_replies": [{"no": 750205, "now": "11/11/22(Fri)20:43:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p750194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;750194</a><br>What in my post makes you think I&#039;m shilling for AoC?

Its a garbage system that makes it obvious they have little experience in this realm. Right now most builds will treat weapons as a primary and a secondary. Secondary has a very specific use. It could be some kind of emergency heal (hatchet/life staff/void gauntlet), it could be something mobility focused to allow you to escape or gap close, debuff application, specific scenarios use like ranged pressure, or something like stun lock/CC. There&#039;s not really any sorta of &quot;combo&quot; or synergy between the weapons themselves. Most of the time you will spend your time in just one weapon and will only switch to achieve one of those top things. But overall it feels janky af<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alligator</span><br>Yeah they can filter players. You gotta attack from the side. If you dodge backwards they&#039;ll still hit you.
