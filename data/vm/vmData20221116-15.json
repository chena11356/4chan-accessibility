Mabinogi is a fun, once popular little old school Korean MMO from 2004 based around Celtic mythology with many different features. Your character can age, rebirth, eat food and gain weight, play and custom make music, and so much more. You can be anything and do anything all at once with no downsides. From non combat related skills like cooking, tailoring, blacksmithing, trading goods in a commerce, carpentry, etc. to different styles of combat like melee, magic, ninja, archery, puppetry, etc. all on 1 character. Although graphics and gameplay is still a bit dated, even after 14 years the game is still rich in content such as fashion contests, cooking contest, jousting, playing in or viewing large concerts, training pets, and so on and continues to be Nexon&#039;s most generous game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;News and Events</span><br>https://mabinogi.nexon.net/news/all<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALL SERVERS HAVE BEEN MERGED</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many combat talents, life talents, commerce system, field bosses have been revamped</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Hybrid Talents coming called Arcana talents</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11/17/2022</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skill training, Renown, Grandmaster, and Crusader skills will become a lot easier to train(lowered training requirements) </span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Guilds]</span><br>We currently have a guild called Mabigen.

Empty speak until the game releases and proves one way or the other. That being said on the topic of balance. The important thing you said here is rock paper scissors. Every class needs to hold a specific role in combat most of the time. Or however you design the combat. I&#039;ve played plenty of inbalanced MMORPGs. You know what happens? Everyone plays the same fucking class. Everyone plays the same weapon/magic/armor combo. You see it all the time. When anything is inbalanced the population as a whole gravitates towards it until 50%+ of matchups/team comps contain it.<br><br>So that&#039;s sorta the issue many developers run into. You need<br>1. Classes that have specific, unique feeling roles<br>2. Classes that can be applied to a majority of the game so no one class is &quot;locked out&quot; of playing the game (save for instances where you need a group). Like having some class that is only useful in 1-3 encounters of the endgame while there are 50+ encounters overall is bad. As an extreme example<br>3. Balance in a way where they are able to hold onto that specific, unique feeling but not be so good that they make up the majority<br>4. You need to continually add in more classes because people expect that sorta thing now a days with major expansions or content drops<br>5. People in general like change. Even if you balance it perfectly. After 5+ years there is a section of the playerbase who will complain about the meta being &quot;stale&quot; or the same for too long. Getting boring. So you gotta rework things, change things, etc. Which ends up causing you to do 1-3 again.<br><br>When I say people, I mean the majority in this post. Now is it possible to try to appeal to some niche audience like others suggested? Sure. But its hard. MMORPG gamers, especially those drawn to niche MMORPGs, are fickle. They&#039;re quick to anger. Quick to hold grudges. Quick to quit. Its a big risk to try to appeal to them.

Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating.

Then read up on The303&#039;s guides.<br>Long answer: Not really. Short answer: Yes.<br>Sven Co-op runs on Svengine, a modified Goldsrc with uplifted limits here and there. What works in HL will work in Sven, but not vice versa.<br>If you know how to make a 3d mesh from scratch, then chances are I don&#039;t need to explain shit for you. Thus most people either kitbash or port models from other sources, then modifying as needed. The go-to source to port stuffs from is either MMD or Source engine.<br>Porting as is, using default (helmet.mdl) skeletons and animations isn&#039;t too difficult. Scaling your mesh and/or skeleton might take some time. Rigging the mesh to your skeleton is the tedious part, depending on how complex your mesh is. You also need to make sure that there are more than one bodygroup(s). Your textures also need to be in .bmp format and of the right resolution, preferably converted via Irfanviewer to preserve quality. By then, you just need to modify the .qc file you&#039;ve taken off the source skeleton (helmet.mdl, for instance) to account for your textures, bodygroups and/or additional bones, if any. Compile it and pray that no errors are being belched. Retardproof your model by having someone run around with it and fix issues where necessary. Re-compile and you&#039;re set to release or shelf it.<br>Making your own animations, skeleton, etc aren&#039;t all that bullshit complex. It&#039;s just that the engine limitations can make it hard for you to keep track of shit you&#039;re not supposed to do, which is why said .pdf is your primer. **Keep the polygon count below 20k - 40k.**<br>I won&#039;t be mentioning UV mapping and texture baking etc because this blogpost is getting too long.", "filename": "honk", "ext": ".png", "w": 1365, "h": 583, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1668615134825240, "time": 1668615134, "md5": "9q4vjOI7liJv2/gFEwtfbA==", "fsize": 3189012, "resto": 737870}], "last_modified": 1668615134}, {"no": 754310, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)06:43:41", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Is everyone ready for OG Xbox Live revival?", "com": "https://nitter.unixfox.eu/insignia_<wbr>live", "filename": "w_null_GpUC0FiSGkc1yaepqGwnNdJdR5UTI9OjC7o4QQiTgYo", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2433, "h": 1993, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 204, "tim": 1668512621083229, "time": 1668512621, "md5": "H5c0BnvDNroU4C9a7w8moQ==", "fsize": 830228, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-everyone-ready-for-og-xbox-live-revival", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 754338, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)08:09:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "congrats to the lucky bastards who got a code today", "time": 1668517757, "resto": 754310}, {"no": 754515, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:11:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p754310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;754310</a><br>just post the real link instead of that shit<br>https://twitter.com/insignia_live", "time": 1668543066, "resto": 754310}, {"no": 754520, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:22:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p754515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;754515</a><br>fyi the site in OP lets you scroll through tweets without a popup interrupting you if you&#039;re not signed in", "time": 1668543747, "resto": 754310}, {"no": 755039, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)11:00:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p754338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;754338</a><br>They just invited everyone who registered about an hour ago.

To briefly go over just one of them, the ambient temperature system: it doesn&#039;t directly affect players through health loss or anything, but it does affect where crops can/can&#039;t be planted, suddenly makes crops destroy themselves if the area is too hot or too cold for too long, and different crops can withstand different temperature ranges. It also governs where saplings can/can&#039;t be planted, etc.<br>Most other new systems are similarly complex, such as an overhauled smithing system for crafting things like tool heads &amp; weapon blades, a nutrient system that affects crop growth &amp; the player&#039;s max health, and more", "time": 1668385965, "resto": 753369}, {"no": 754466, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:13:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Only TFC? kinda lame", "time": 1668535984, "resto": 753369}, {"no": 754483, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:01:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.18.2 TFC</span><br>what in the fuck", "filename": "1620152927562", "ext": ".png", "w": 259, "h": 219, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1668538901145410, "time": 1668538901, "md5": "DyqimJoXNKFtVoy9MaMR4Q==", "fsize": 103074, "resto": 753369}, {"no": 754743, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)21:48:10", "name": "sa ge", "com": "<a href=\"#p753369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;753369</a><br>OP here, I&#039;d like to remake this thread with a new link that doesn&#039;t change every time I update the modpack, a better connection guide, and more details in general.
