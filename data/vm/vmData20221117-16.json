Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating. At this point you\u2019re literally a needle in a haystack, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re fighting anything, you don\u2019t need to pay attention to the game at all.

I was a /tg/station player, it use to be great in the early-mid 2010&#039;s, but some shit was unraveling by 2017 and when my break occurred in 2019, shit was drastically changing from mechanics to how admins operated by the end of that year. People aren&#039;t wrong when they say trannies have gained a foothold on how the server is operated. They wiggle their way in or some mentally unstable person in the higher ranks converts to one and starts acting irrationally. In 2020, I came back and got in trouble for a name I used for years on there (it was a caveman name where I&#039;d refer to myself by name) and because of what my character looked like (hogan mustache that was red, black skin, and an afro). Never had a problem with this for years, but because their naming convention changed I was permabanned from naming my character differently unless I appealed. Decided to just quit there. Shame since the admins use to do stuff like Ligger uprisings for civil rights.
