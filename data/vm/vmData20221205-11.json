When you see a bomb on screen, the timing for the explosion is always going to be the same regardless of whether it&#039;s yours or some else&#039;s.

You never see the same people in D3 chat and the clan system that could remedy this is an afterthought. D2&#039;s chat is unpoliced, not useful in game, and gives no sense of its scope. It&#039;s fine that D2 is like this and I imagine no one wanted it changed for D2R, but it should have inspired a good system for D3. WoW is just as bad, with world semi-merges confusing who is where and the game taking people in and out of each other&#039;s worlds as needed for stability or to address isolation.

Mabinogi is a fun, once popular little old school Korean MMO from 2004 based around Celtic mythology with many different features. Your character can age, rebirth, eat food and gain weight, play and custom make music, and so much more. You can be anything and do anything all at once with no downsides. From non combat related skills like cooking, tailoring, blacksmithing, trading goods in a commerce, carpentry, etc. to different styles of combat like melee, magic, ninja, archery, puppetry, etc. all on 1 character. Although graphics and gameplay is still a bit dated, even after 14 years the game is still rich in content such as fashion contests, cooking contest, jousting, playing in or viewing large concerts, training pets, and so on and continues to be Nexon&#039;s most generous game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;News and Events</span><br>https://mabinogi.nexon.net/news/all<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALL SERVERS HAVE BEEN MERGED</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many combat talents, life talents, commerce system, field bosses have been revamped</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New Hybrid Talents coming called Arcana talents</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11/17/2022</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skill training, Renown, Grandmaster, and Crusader skills have become a lot easier to train(lowered training requirements) </span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Guilds]</span><br>We currently have a guild called Mabigen.

This is accomplished through a clever assortment of construction and destruction skills, communication abilities, metagaming, in-game coordination, and social connections. There are organized zombie groups, player-killer societies, people who hunt player killers, and various survivor groups focused on defending unique locations. All of this is done in a turn-based way where you earn a turn each half hour up to a total of 50, which you can spend all at once or spread out over the course of the day. This means you can travel long distances in a short time, or spend the day guarding and scouting in short sessions, but not both.<br><br>Urban Dead has one factor which I think is the most important for a multiplayer community - a relatively small and permanent player base which doesn&#039;t move between servers. Everyone in the game is always there unless they quit. Your character never logs out unless you stop playing for several days, so if somebody enters your stronghold and murders your leader - or you - or bad news comes over the radio, you learn about it when you return.<br><br>I am grossly oversimplifying all of this and also I am a little drunk, but at the end of the day what you have is frankly a fairly toxic game, but made up of many communities some of which aren&#039;t toxic, and it&#039;s the game in which I&#039;ve made the most friends. I&#039;m even friends with some of my in-game enemies, while I&#039;ve come to hate some of the people working in my own faction.<br><br>Note that this is an old screenshot.

For a while I suspected that my good experience was the result of choosing a server called Deckard Cain - perhaps an older player base eager to represent for D2 - but after a merge with three other servers I was proven wrong. Immortal has the best community I&#039;ve seen since the early days of Minecraft. It&#039;s deliberate and revolutionary, and I&#039;m afraid we will lose it when the game fails, just as we lost countless good ideas when Asheron&#039;s Call and Anarchy Online failed.<br><br>To try and keep this as simple as possible: <br><br>The guilds on an Immoral server do some challenges to become Shadow, which is a sort of brotherhood of guilds who are in a constant cycle to overthrow the Immortals, a set of 3 allied guilds with special privileges. Each week, the Shadow guilds work to increase their power, then compete against each other for the right to challenge the Immortal guilds. The top ranking Shadows then fight the Immortals, and if they win a throwdown ensues to determine which Shadow guild will take the Immortal throne. When they do this, they pick two other guilds to join them.<br><br>What all this boils down to is regular competition between guilds who mostly need to work together, towards a showdown between factions whose members used to be allies and will be allies again soon. In half a year of playing, I have NEVER seen toxicity in chat beyond a short burst of infighting following the server merge. I am a terrible player with a gimped character, but I&#039;m in one of the top guilds on my server, and have a raiding group that carries me. Before and after any contest you see nothing but gg and thanks in the public chat.

There was a PVE questline but it was just to level you up for PvP and to give you a little bit of flavor context as to what your nation is like and what you are fighting for. Once a month, the players of each nation would elect a nation leader who could set vendor taxes and distribute the nation&#039;s warchest and schedule when wars happened (usually on weekend afternoons). During war, you had hundreds of players pushing into enemy territory and capturing points, people flying ahead to scout out for enemy movements, people infiltrating deep into enemy territory trying to find a spot to hide in and start portalling in reinforcements. You had desperate battles at chokepoints and counter pushes. Eventually one side would reach the gates of the enemy city and there would be a climatic showdown to blow up their mothership. During week days, there were smaller wars over capturable airships and space stations, which functioned as guildhalls for whichever brigade claimed them. Sadly that game was killed off by the implementation of a literal P2W slotmachine that gave you the best armors in the game.<br><br>I am currently playing GW2. WvW is fun in small doses, but there is no flavor. You are not fighting for the Anti-Nationalists against the Imperialists or for the Horde against the Alliance. You&#039;re red team fighting against green and blue team, who are indistinguishable from you in aesthetics, and there is no lore. You don&#039;t feel like you are fighting in the name of your country. You can claim forts in the name of your guild, but you can&#039;t decorate the fort, and the keep gets taken back by the enemy within an hour anyway.

It looked so dumb I just laughed and closed the vid. It\u2019s a shame because I was originally excited for Dragonflight because the zones and mobs looked good.

Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating.
