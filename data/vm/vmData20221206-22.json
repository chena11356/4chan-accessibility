I imagine most rare crafting materials (damascus ingots, venomous claws, shining cloth, etc) are going to be used for the participating linkshell members assuming they have a crafter. so all of that is going to be ultra rare until more groups start competing in end game events to trickle down all those high profile items.<br>but what even is the largest source of gil generation in the game to begin with? nation rank ups?

Asheron&#039;s Call. When you die, you lose the most valuable item in your inventory. This applies to both PvP and PvE, so the fact that you can&#039;t recover your macguffin from another player is no different from losing it to a monster. Players who find item loss stressful can remedy it by carrying a gemstone more valuable than their best gear piece.<br><br>2. Urban Dead. Players cannot drop inventory at all, but remain in game 24 hours a day regardless of whether the player is logged in. This means they must either learn how to hide, forge good relationships with other players, or be careful who they piss off. I made a career of hunting player-killers in this game, though it was mostly in fun and they tend to be the nicest people in Urban Dead.<br><br>3. Minecraft. To my knowledge the only game that has done loot theft right. Of course this was ruined by cheaters and then ruined again by mods, but on a vanilla server with a whitelisted community, you drop all your shit on death and it winds up in the asshole&#039;s hidden stash, and you can go and find that stash, or take their shit in the field and make them trade for it.", "filename": "never again", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 911, "h": 930, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670261019005255, "time": 1670261019, "md5": "wRdUBYtITo72k5ZhIBVD2g==", "fsize": 308659, "resto": 765999}, {"no": 771602, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:42:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "you really listed micecraft in a thread about mmos, this genre is completely fucked lmao", "time": 1670265768, "resto": 765999}, {"no": 771626, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)14:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p771602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;771602</a><br>That is the sad truth, that minecraft is a better MMO than anything that has come out in the past 15 years.", "time": 1670268767, "resto": 765999}, {"no": 771649, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)15:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p771565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;771565</a><br>You may want to check out the Dekarutide server that just launched.

This is accomplished through a clever assortment of construction and destruction skills, communication abilities, metagaming, in-game coordination, and social connections. There are organized zombie groups, player-killer societies, people who hunt player killers, and various survivor groups focused on defending unique locations. All of this is done in a turn-based way where you earn a turn each half hour up to a total of 50, which you can spend all at once or spread out over the course of the day. This means you can travel long distances in a short time, or spend the day guarding and scouting in short sessions, but not both.<br><br>Urban Dead has one factor which I think is the most important for a multiplayer community - a relatively small and permanent player base which doesn&#039;t move between servers. Everyone in the game is always there unless they quit. Your character never logs out unless you stop playing for several days, so if somebody enters your stronghold and murders your leader - or you - or bad news comes over the radio, you learn about it when you return.<br><br>I am grossly oversimplifying all of this and also I am a little drunk, but at the end of the day what you have is frankly a fairly toxic game, but made up of many communities some of which aren&#039;t toxic, and it&#039;s the game in which I&#039;ve made the most friends. I&#039;m even friends with some of my in-game enemies, while I&#039;ve come to hate some of the people working in my own faction.<br><br>Note that this is an old screenshot.

For a while I suspected that my good experience was the result of choosing a server called Deckard Cain - perhaps an older player base eager to represent for D2 - but after a merge with three other servers I was proven wrong. Immortal has the best community I&#039;ve seen since the early days of Minecraft. It&#039;s deliberate and revolutionary, and I&#039;m afraid we will lose it when the game fails, just as we lost countless good ideas when Asheron&#039;s Call and Anarchy Online failed.<br><br>To try and keep this as simple as possible: <br><br>The guilds on an Immoral server do some challenges to become Shadow, which is a sort of brotherhood of guilds who are in a constant cycle to overthrow the Immortals, a set of 3 allied guilds with special privileges. Each week, the Shadow guilds work to increase their power, then compete against each other for the right to challenge the Immortal guilds. The top ranking Shadows then fight the Immortals, and if they win a throwdown ensues to determine which Shadow guild will take the Immortal throne. When they do this, they pick two other guilds to join them.<br><br>What all this boils down to is regular competition between guilds who mostly need to work together, towards a showdown between factions whose members used to be allies and will be allies again soon. In half a year of playing, I have NEVER seen toxicity in chat beyond a short burst of infighting following the server merge. I am a terrible player with a gimped character, but I&#039;m in one of the top guilds on my server, and have a raiding group that carries me. Before and after any contest you see nothing but gg and thanks in the public chat. I won&#039;t kid you, almost everything else about the game is either boring or just plain terrible, but it&#039;s my main game anyway because, socially, all the things we lost when WoW went to shit and the other MMOs failed, are here in this game, for now.", "filename": "Screenshot (2677)", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670158689494711, "time": 1670158689, "md5": "nWWKequANqhorRih4p6s1g==", "fsize": 1667522, "resto": 677502}, {"no": 770606, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:03:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p770603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;770603</a><br>Holy fuck this is the same thread I posted in three months ago.

Truth is it\u2019s really boring. Meeting a good variety of NPCs is way more fun than meeting players that act the same way as in real life depressed emo wannabe. It\u2019s funny how a lot of MMORPG players seek the role playing aspect through PC simulations of Tabletop RPGs that only display still images and do not realize that they could do the same in the 3D world they\u2019re used to reside in\u2026 to a certain extent, which brings up my second point. <br><br>You have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m going to use pic related as an example because if you\u2019re on this website you\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s say you have a world like the Aincrad where you need to defeat a floor boss to access the next area. Even if you just killed that boss, everybody still have to do the same. You somehow didn\u2019t pave the way for other players. So you\u2019re in the same world, but not really. Whatever you do do not matter and cannot reach others. The reason for that is obvious; most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play the game. Ironically, somewhat large scale co-op games are better than MMORPGs if you want to experience a virtual world with other people because they allow less restrictions on that matter. <br><br>When it comes to gameplay, I wonder why so many people start drooling whenever they see the number of players allowed in raids increase although 40 players raids like in Ashes of Creation feels nothing like cooperating. At this point you\u2019re literally a needle in a haystack, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re fighting anything, you don\u2019t need to pay attention to the game at all.
