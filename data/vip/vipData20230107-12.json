Only banks and the mint make fiat money; everyone else simply transfers it from existing capital. This says nothing about the value of work or exchange, but rather the actual fiat face value in numbers. So all the &quot;rich&quot; people, such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett, never made a single cent; they only ever had money transferred to them from the preexisting money pool. The money pool only has money put into it by the mint or a bank (an approved deposit-taking institution or similar), and the latter, the bank or lever, injects 90% of the money. Shares that are not realized represent a sort of quasi-money where they are swapped with other shares at a notional value, but that is a different question. Money is fiat and is made by fractional reserve banking through loans and deposited into an account. This then makes it a tax on everyone through inflation. Also, the only way to pay off a loan is for someone to take out a loan later on, and that loan money must flow to you to be able to pay off your loan, and so on. It&#039;s essentially a pyramid scheme of loans. This is not necessarily bad, as it brings capital and labor together, but when it becomes disconnected from underlying value and fiat has pure capital allocation against underlying value, then you see everything shortages, and things that can capture price inflation, such as houses, go up in price forever over the long term. At some inflection point, the everything shortage may see food stuffs and everything else go up much more quickly, as people sitting in offices sending paper around to each other have limited overall efficiency gains and do not actually grow food.

I have only watched the first four, and they&#039;re all quite fun, but apparently they&#039;re still making these movies, no idea if they&#039;re as good.<br>The first movie is extremely competent and well made, strong characters, strong acting, strong script, strong effects, strong pacing, strong jokes, lots of attention to detail.

It&#039;s a pretty heavy gun, but it&#039;s also borderline indestructible and runs like a sewing machine, and when down on its bipod, the weight makes it keep pretty steady. Initially the MAG-58 was adopted by the US as the M240, to be mounted on tanks, because they found the M60 wasn&#039;t entirely suited for that role, then eventually the US Marine Core would adopt it because they weren&#039;t entirely happy with the M60 either, the M240 working better as a vehicle gun, and still being well usable for infantry on foot. Eventually the M240B (Bravo) comes to replace the M60E3 in US Army service as a GPMG, and it&#039;s a heavier gun, but it doesn&#039;t beat itself up like M60 was still doing by the E3 iteration.<br><br>These days, they&#039;re up to the M240L (Lima) iteration, which uses things like a titanium receiver, shaving as many as 5.5lbs(!) off of the beast, down to 22lbs, without affecting durability and longevity.

The machine gun uses a mixed recoil-operated locking system with a hinged bolt that is patterned after the lever-action Peabody Martini breechblock.[3] The recoil operation is part short and part long recoil. After firing a round to start the open bolt firing cycle, the initial recoil impulse drives the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt to the rear. A pin on the right side of the bolt moves backward in grooves in an operating cam plate mounted to the right side of the receiver. After 12.7 mm (0.5 in) of travel, the bolt is cammed upward, away from the breech (the &quot;short&quot; portion of the recoil system). The barrel and barrel extension continue to move rearward to a point slightly exceeding the combined overall length of the cartridge case and projectile (the long portion of the recoil system, responsible for the weapon&#039;s low rate of fire).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the breech is exposed, an odd lever-type extractor/ejector, mounted under the barrel, pivots to the rear, extracts the empty case, and ejects it through the bottom of the receiver. The bolt&#039;s operating cam then forces the bolt face to pivot downward, aligning a cartridge feed groove in the left side of the bolt with the chamber. While the bolt and barrel are returning forward, a cartridge-rammer lever, mounted on the barrel extension, pivots forward, loading a fresh cartridge.</span>", "filename": "Madsen Machinegun", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 1310, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 54, "tim": 1666040895356251, "time": 1666040895, "md5": "+mf2h5HhvGZHOsiBURc5Og==", "fsize": 1486431, "resto": 104447}, {"no": 119732, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)17:50:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There&#039;s more interesting mechanical features of the gun, the first is the big pivoting crank charging-handle, which you see on other guns like the Maxim machinegun (the big watercooled ones on tripods and vehicles), but then you have the top mounted magazines, which don&#039;t have conventional feed lips, rather there&#039;s a big and long leaf spring which holds the cartridges in place, which are then released to the feed when inserted, where there&#039;s a wedge which pivots out of the way to accept one cartridge at a time, then pivots back to push it into the feedway, also making sure the next one doesn&#039;t &quot;cut in line.&quot; <br>As there&#039;s no feed lips to have to accommodate the exact shape of cartridges, .30-06 Springfield and 7.92mm Mauser (which have some rough dimensional similarities) fit and function with the same magazines, and the gun was available in a lot of different rifle cartridges, both rimmed and rimless ones, so you&#039;ll see some with very curvy magazines.

Thompson, to bring up more notable names.<br><br>The program was actually largely focused on the new and proposed .276 Pedersen rifle cartridge, a slightly smaller one which would provide comparable exterior ballistics to the .30-06 M2 Ball cartridge already in use, but with less recoil, weight, and bulk. Compare it to 6.5mm Swedish, 6.5mm Arisaka, etc. There was a lot of support around this cartridge, because it was actually pretty good looking on paper, but it would ultimately be vetoed by General Douglas MacArthur, who in one sense was a deranged and bloodthirsty lunatic for completely different and unrelated reasons, but who was also totally right about the issue.<br>To start with, the US Army didn&#039;t actually have all that much budget at the time, while it still had massive stockpiles of M2 Ball from WW1 which still worked perfectly fine. Adopting a .276 infantry rifle meant a gun which was no longer compatible with this stockpile, and it would also mean that you no longer used the same ammunition for rifles and machineguns, which in those days would be a pretty considerable drawback in logistics, unless you wanted to replace or adapt those to the new cartridge, which would be a pretty costly and time consuming proposition.<br><br>The rifle which ends up winning the trials is of course Garand&#039;s, he was one of the contestants who had also continued developing their rifle in the .30-06 cartridge with the understanding that the .276 one may have a fuzzy future, and his was also the best by far. Pedersen&#039;s rifle (which used an almost Luger-like toggle-lock mechanism) came second, while Thompson&#039;s was actually quite awful, mostly for being based on imaginary principles of physics, ejecting spent cases with enough force that they tended to lodge themselves into nearby wood boards and fenceposts.", "filename": "douglasmacarthur", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 425, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672844663733455, "time": 1672844663, "md5": "cYhE7y3oQFxVsIo73clCSQ==", "fsize": 106700, "resto": 104447}, {"no": 121168, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)10:06:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The M1 which entered service was using a so called &quot;gas-trap&quot; setup, known primarily from Danish inventor S\u00f8ren Bang, where instead of drilling a port in the barrel to tap gas from, a concept which a lot of people were paranoid about in that day and age, there&#039;s instead a sliding inverted cup at the front of the muzzle. The bullet exists the muzzle and fills the cup with gas, which pulls it forward to actuate an action bar or similar.<br><br>This sort of works, but not well, it&#039;s fidgety and the gasses leaving the bore into the larger and less sealed cup cools them down and produces more carbon which has no choice but layer in there, so a gas-trap action will actually get very dirty, very fast, you could not be expected to get past 100rds in ideal conditions before you start seeing problems. Some time into service use, this eventually gets faced, and the decision is made to upgrade/retrofit the M1. <br>By 1939 it gets a more sane setup with a port drilled into the barrel which acts like a more conventional (in hindsight) long-stroke piston, and which to the surprise of doubters, doesn&#039;t reduce the lifespan of a rifle barrel, doesn&#039;t worsen accuracy, doesn&#039;t dirty easier (it dirties far less and is way easier to clean), and is 100% an improvement. The US Army gets into retrofitting the existing rifles as well as updating the production, and though smaller numbers of earlier gas-trap rifles did make it into the European theater in WW2 in rear echelon places, the vast majority of M1 rifles which were originally built with the Bang system got retrofitted, so unmodified examples are actually incredibly rare today.<br><br>That a rifle employing a jank-ass setup like this would end up readily trouncing the other contestants kind of paints a picture of how well THOSE worked.

You&#039;re retarded for thinking $20/year is a lot of money.<br>2. You&#039;re retarded for not understanding that the time saved from having a pass vs the time wasted from the insanely shit captcha system is FAR more valuable than $20.<br><br>Maybe on a good day you come on 4chan with a fresh IP and you get a lucky easy captcha that solves in 3 seconds.  Then your next post takes, 5, then 10, then 20 and so on.  I&#039;ve had streaks where this goddamn shit system has made me solve the super-slow-fading tiles with &quot;Try again&quot; or &quot;You must solve more&quot; that went on for TWO TO THREE MINUTES, for a post that took my genius fingers 5 nanoseconds to type (and no, this retarded system does not &quot;encourage higher quality posts&quot;, it increases anger and aggression and leads to MORE shitposts).  Even the audio captcha now demands multiple solves to go through, and you&#039;ll still eventually get &quot;TOO MANY REQUESTS, TRY AGAIN LATER&quot; and by physically blocked from posting after 30-40 minutes of serious discussion.<br><br>So let&#039;s take a GENEROUSLY small number of 10 seconds per captcha, and say you&#039;re a baby neophyte channer that only makes 100 posts a day.

I was brought up in the Evangelical &quot;Church&quot;, such as it is but nothing about it ever felt quite right. After reading a book on actual history, a book more about an empire than a religion, so much about Christian culture became clear to me, and I realized that Orthodoxy seems to be the Christianity that every Evangelical is trying to reach for but doesn&#039;t quite know where to look, or even what it would look like if they saw it. The original biblical texts of the new testament are largely Greek. Most of the idea of what even forms a &quot;church&quot; today comes from the councils held by the Byzantines.

This is sounding incredibly pretty, my friend! I think this definitely works, especially up to the 0:35 mark! After that, I might suggest bringing in a new instrument as you go into the new section? Maybe a new line on something like a flute, clarinet, or trumpet? Could be playing counter to the current piano melody! Like, a nice, simple line, to contrast how active the piano is.<br><br>At the section change at 1:03, maybe you could add a little percussion too? Depends on the color, and direction you want for the character. I could maybe see a snare drum line, or just some simple, low, resonant hits, to reinforce that we&#039;re near the end of the piece!

I write the melody, the chords, and the overall form from beginning to end on piano, and then start transferring things over to other instruments, depending on the style, and type of music! So like, you can have a melody on guitar, or chords on strings, or synths, or whatever! It&#039;s a sort of &quot;start small, and develop things to get bigger&quot; mindset though that I work with.<br><br>Layers get added in depending on what things are often needed. Once you have melody, chords, and form, I&#039;ll typically bring in percussion, which can be a huge part of a piece overall! Then I&#039;ll add a bass, and it can be an actual electric bass, or low strings, or trombone, or whatever! But it&#039;s a low melody line that re-enforcing the roots of the chords, and the progression you&#039;re on! One thing I like to do in particular though is write a counter-melody that sits slightly less importantly than the main melody line. This risks feeling busy, but that&#039;s where mixing, and panning can come into play. A main melody can be situated dead center, while a counter melody could be panned in the sides, so there&#039;s extra room.<br><br><a href=\"#p117219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117219</a><br>Like this piece is a decent example of that. The guitar is played center, while the violins are skewed about 35% to the left and right. There also lots of other little stuff going on in this one. Like you have some string shorts on viola and cello playing stuff, but they&#039;re mostly just outlining the chord progression, and creating some extra rhythmic energy to go along with the percussion, and bass. Same with the piano, which is just playing some chords rhythmically in the background.", "time": 1668404003, "resto": 93378}, {"no": 120304, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)13:03:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p120275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120275</a><br>Cool thanks anon, I&#039;ll play with it a little", "time": 1668449035, "resto": 93378}, {"no": 120948, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)16:12:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://soundcloud.com/ts2000/morni<wbr>ng-mist-update-mastered<br><br>I made some cold music!", "time": 1671225168, "resto": 93378}, {"no": 120950, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)18:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p120948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120948</a><br>Sounds good anon.
