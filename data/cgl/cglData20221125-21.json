So I was cosplaying Oz from Pandora Hearts and this chick came up to me cosplaying Shuten Douji. Hung out for a bit till we split up later. This was friday. On saturday night we ended up meeting at a party. I wasn&#039;t in cosplay but she was in Shuten Douji again. She didn&#039;t say/tried to act like she wasn&#039;t but she was a total light weight but wanted to go drink for drink with me. It ended with having a light buzz and her completely hammered. Like we are talking barely able to function levels of hammered. Honestly this is super fucking gap moe. Especially if you know Shuten Douji. Anyway it was like 4am and I tried asking her where she was staying so I could take her back but all she&#039;d reply with is about how she recently got some new plants at home and was taking care of them. So I ended up carrying her back to my hotel room. So I put her on one of the beds and went to sleep on the other. So like an hour or so goes by and I wake up and she is cuddled up next to me. Which you know honestly was pretty great. As I was deciding whether to wake her up or just let her sleep she starts throwing up. As she is facing me I take the first blow lol. Anyway I get her to the bathroom and she continues on and off for prob 30-40 minutes. Through I don&#039;t think she ever fully woke up... she went full back to sleep. So I pick her back up and put her back on the bed after wiping her face off. Wake up later and she apologizes for passes out at the party and I say it was no biggy. We exchange numbers and she leaves. The end.<br><br>Some might call this a horror story but I honestly wouldn&#039;t mind it happening again. Maybe I just like taking care of people.

I think on one hand it&#039;s good because it encourages lolitas to take care of their clothes, to spend a long time searching for specific pieces and to curate a nice wardrobe. But on the other hand there&#039;s this expectation of having to have a lot of stuff that I think influences a lot of lolitas to buy things that they wouldn&#039;t actually want. For seasoned lolitas who are shopping addicts they feel like they need to panic buy EVERY new release or rare piece that comes up on the secondhand market, while for newbies they see lolitas with impressive wardrobes they&#039;ve spent years accumulating and they think they need to buy a whole wardrobe NOW.

To prevent this, regular diet breaks are shown to help reduce changes to metabolism. Also, the effect of calories on reduced metabolism shown in studies is also not that much - by like 10-20% max, and it isn&#039;t a hard fact dieting will reduce your metabolism, as shown in some recovering anorexics with monitored eating who still struggle to gain weight as they enter a period of hypermetabolism after increasing calories (increased calorie consumption leads to greater energy expenditure, and vice versa for lowering calories).

I don&#039;t know SDCC at all, but what I can say is that the event has grown to such a level that is any disaster happens, people would die stomped, and the life of the average attendee is terrible: expensive food, lots of lines, horrible bathrooms, and basically all you can do is shop (200,000+ people in the four days of the event do that to you).<br><br>Plus the tickets are growing more and more expensive - the price of one day buys one a half or two tickets for other major events in Brazil.<br><br>And to top it off, many content creators are getting denied for having no &quot;synergy&quot; with the comic con and its themed. Creators that were in other editions with their press credentials, and it&#039;s been the biggest fuzz in our local community.<br><br>I want to know from my /cgl/ folks - to what measure conventions in America/Europe are becoming moneygrabbers and are new &#039;comic cons&#039; or cosplay events getting created out of this &#039;power vacuum&#039;?", "filename": "ccxp", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668708567726010, "time": 1668708567, "md5": "OQQpf1G37FNdx3RBBaR5zw==", "fsize": 72710, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ccxp-comic-con-experience-2022-in-brazil", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 10818863, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)13:40:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10818857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10818857</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;CCXP 2022</span><br>Fuck Omelete, CCXP, Borgo, leftoids and trannies.

Tissue paper. Water-soluble stabilizer. Tissue paper on both sides. You need to stabilize it somehow and make it act like a regular, stiff fabric until you remove it from the machine.<br><br>- a zigzag stitch will work better than straight. Straight pushes the fabric and causes it to warp especially if you don&#039;t have a walking foot. Legit no one will notice or care if you use a zigzag finish vs. straight stitch at this tier of sewing.<br><br>- pin perpendicular to where you&#039;re sewing. This is like one of the weirdest mistakes I keep seeing.

We were hoping for a hard vaccine+boost along with a N95 mask mandate, but simple masking will only be required if mandated by the City of Columbus. This has led to 75% of all volunteers resigning and the resignation of two vice-chairs that help organize the con. In addition, the medical volunteers have all resigned meaning Ohayocon will not have any medical staff on hand for the con for 2023. I was one of those who resigned last week and wanted the share the information. As an immunocompromised person, I almost died from contracting COVID and still suffer from the effects to this day.
