I don&#039;t know SDCC at all, but what I can say is that the event has grown to such a level that is any disaster happens, people would die stomped, and the life of the average attendee is terrible: expensive food, lots of lines, horrible bathrooms, and basically all you can do is shop (200,000+ people in the four days of the event do that to you).<br><br>Plus the tickets are growing more and more expensive - the price of one day buys one a half or two tickets for other major events in Brazil.<br><br>And to top it off, many content creators are getting denied for having no &quot;synergy&quot; with the comic con and its themed. Creators that were in other editions with their press credentials, and it&#039;s been the biggest fuzz in our local community.<br><br>I want to know from my /cgl/ folks - to what measure conventions in America/Europe are becoming moneygrabbers and are new &#039;comic cons&#039; or cosplay events getting created out of this &#039;power vacuum&#039;?", "filename": "ccxp", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668708567726010, "time": 1668708567, "md5": "OQQpf1G37FNdx3RBBaR5zw==", "fsize": 72710, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ccxp-comic-con-experience-2022-in-brazil", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 10818863, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)13:40:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10818857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10818857</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;CCXP 2022</span><br>Fuck Omelete, CCXP, Borgo, leftoids and trannies.

Also even these would be insisting that goth is only silver when asked back in the &#039;00s. I shit you not, there are interviews recorded. The process of &quot;getting rid of brass/gold for good&quot; took place more or less in 1995-2000. Reasons are unknown to me tho. Maybe goth just followed mainstream fashion here and there is nothing more to add here. Or maybe it became associated too strongly with &quot;steampunk crowd&quot; that was gaining traction around that time and didn&#039;t shed that association fully yet even tho steampunk is pretty much dead fad at this point. To see so called &quot;tradgoth&quot; wear it nowadays is like meet a Big Foot in the wild. As for back in the &#039;80s you can easily find tons of photos in which goths wear brass/bronze items (silvery metals dominate but brassy is still very noticeable) - earrings, chains, belt buckles, bracelets typically. They are seen in like 1/3-1/4 of photos from that time. You can still see brass worn in earliest years of WGT festival. Good luck finding photos (they are veeeer rare) or seeing someone in the club wearing brass nowadays. DESU I&#039;m kinda fed off of seeing silver on black all the time.<br><br>Posting a nice photo of black room with wood and wicker item&#039;s that I find interesting. Good example that you can mix various wood tones and black and introduce brass and green details. Also these lilies are nice touch.

Tissue paper. Water-soluble stabilizer. Tissue paper on both sides. You need to stabilize it somehow and make it act like a regular, stiff fabric until you remove it from the machine.<br><br>- a zigzag stitch will work better than straight. Straight pushes the fabric and causes it to warp especially if you don&#039;t have a walking foot. Legit no one will notice or care if you use a zigzag finish vs. straight stitch at this tier of sewing.<br><br>- pin perpendicular to where you&#039;re sewing. This is like one of the weirdest mistakes I keep seeing. Pinning straight may seem to save you time/pins but the fabric will slide with the pressure of the foot and feed dogs.<br><br>- get the proper needle, get the walking foot, play with stitch lengths, etc.<br><br>- for the love of god please stabilize the fabric", "time": 1668490090, "resto": 10817921}, {"no": 10818332, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:19:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10818324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10818324</a><br>Thanks for the tips!

Youmacon has been going on for 18 years now and is a celebration of Anime, manga, pop-culture, comics, movies, costumes and SCIENCE. If you don&#039;t like all of these things then maybe you should just stay at home.<br><br>And that brings us to the first thing we want to report- IF YOU HAVEN&#039;T BEEN VACCINATED WE DON&#039;T EVEN WANT YOU TO COME. STAY AWAY. WE ARE A CONVENTION FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. If you cannot get your Covid-19 vaccinations then you may only come if you get a PCR negative test on Tuesday or later. But that should be reserved for people who have a medical reason that prevents them from getting their vaccines. We will not have PCR testing available on site.<br><br>BUT IF YOU JUST DON&#039;T WANT TO TAKE THE VACCINES BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THE LIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES- THEN WE REALLY HOPE YOU JUST STAY AWAY.<br><br>All staff may check your Vaccine Passports at all times. Failure to show your Vaccine Passport at any time to any staff MAY RESULT HAVING YOUR BADGE TAKEN AND YOU BEING REMOVED FROM THE CONVENTION. We recommend using CLEAR (digital vaccination card that can be stored on your phone). We believe this will make everyone feel safest for the event!", "filename": "image (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1361, "h": 845, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 155, "tim": 1661562533953197, "time": 1661562533, "md5": "y9nu+fgDbpg7K/9LedgDUA==", "fsize": 753415, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "youmacon-2022-detroit-renaissance-center-nov-3rd", "replies": 296, "images": 52, "omitted_posts": 291, "omitted_images": 52, "last_replies": [{"no": 10818401, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)09:07:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10818358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10818358</a><br>Youmacon is an absolute shitshow on facebook right now.

What are the downsides to making skirts with elastic waistbands? Is it worth it to learn how to make skirts with shirred waistbands or even just completely non elasticated waistbands with a button or zipper? Sorry if this is retarded to ask but when I googled this sort of stuff I couldnt find too much info. Im interesting in learning how to make strong garments that last a long time in hopes of eventually selling them to people.", "time": 1668355319, "resto": 10754851}, {"no": 10817886, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)12:00:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p10817874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;10817874</a><br>I recommend learning how to do a partially elasticated waist band. In the front it looks like a normal smooth waist band and it&#039;s reinforced inside with fusible interfacing, in the back there&#039;s a section (not all the way to the side seams) that has either one wide elastic (about an inch wide) or 2 or 3 tunnels with narrower elastic. There&#039;s a blind zipper in the side seam with one or two buttons above it. If you want you can add removable waist ties.<br><br>There&#039;s no real downside to making only fully elasticated waist bands. It depends on your preference.<br>What I consider the downside is that <br>-it&#039;s another fully elasticated waist band on top of the elasticated waist band of the petticoat and bloomers. This can be uncomfortable because of the pressure of the three combined.<br>-I don&#039;t think it looks neat to have the front elasticated. I would feel the need to stick with blouses that are supposed to be worn over the waistband instead of tucked in. If you have a defined waist I think it&#039;s more flattering to tuck in the blouse, but that only looks good imo with a waistband that&#039;s smooth in front.<br><br><br>This was the way many lolita skirts from brands were made when I learned to sew.
