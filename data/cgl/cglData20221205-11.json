As a former panelist and a con old fart with 10 years of con going its kinda sad. The quality of panels is undeniably getting worse. There are various factors that contribute to this and it really depends on each con. <br><br>Most of the time its a lack of quality control which is typically the case with smaller cons that cant get enough submissions to fill the timeslots for all the available rooms. They just take what they can get and assign the panelist a room, a time and move on regardless of how the panel is laid out or how incompetent the panelist may be. <br><br>For bigger cons with plenty of panel applicants its a mixed bag. A lot of the time panels will simply be booked for the sole purpose of pandering to popular fandoms or interest groups. This insures that attendance is guaranteed to be at least decent. Plus it can be used as good advertising for say someone who has little to no con experience and is looking at the events schedule for things to do. Again this doesn&#039;t take into consideration the quality of the panel or panelist. It only takes into consideration the attention it&#039;s subject matter can generate. <br><br>Another thing I&#039;ve come to learn and experience with big cons is internal politics and nepotism almost always come into play when it comes to selecting panelists and that definitely plays a role into why some incompetent panelists end up being booked every year to do the same sad panels. I&#039;ve witnessed an experienced and popular panelist who does awesome interactive panels on obscure video games get their panel yanked because the events coordinator&#039;s girlfriend last minute wanted to do a panel on cosplay makeup tips from ticktock.<br><br>I have also seen over the years a lot of subject matters and panel styles be banned for better or worse. This is of course due to venue&#039;s updating their policies. Colleges banning panels with pornographic material/hentai.

If you&#039;ve been going to cons for years you&#039;re bound to have seen just about everything and it gets a bit boring. Guests who do panels tell the same old stories over and over cause they do more panels in a year then their job in entertainment and it indeed just devolves into a circle jerk. If you&#039;ve never seen it before it might be interesting or fun. But, after hearing the same schtick over and over its kinda a waste. Law of diminishing returns.<br><br>It&#039;s probably a bit of both panels are getting crappier and you may have done enough panels to the point where you&#039;ve hit diminishing returns. <br><br>Seems like the best things about cons these days are the interactions with other con goers and crazy bizarre shit you see and experience on a regular basis. Like when a guy jumps off a balcony onto an inflatable cow below or when you see a dude dressed as Santa dragging around naked chicks with reindeer antler headbands on leashes.

They will eat blends that are part synthetic part natural fibers, like acrylic/wool sweaters, so heads up on that.
