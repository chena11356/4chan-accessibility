Tissue paper. Water-soluble stabilizer. Tissue paper on both sides. You need to stabilize it somehow and make it act like a regular, stiff fabric until you remove it from the machine.<br><br>- a zigzag stitch will work better than straight. Straight pushes the fabric and causes it to warp especially if you don&#039;t have a walking foot. Legit no one will notice or care if you use a zigzag finish vs. straight stitch at this tier of sewing.<br><br>- pin perpendicular to where you&#039;re sewing.

There&#039;s a blind zipper in the side seam with one or two buttons above it.

This can be uncomfortable because of the pressure of the three combined.<br>-I don&#039;t think it looks neat to have the front elasticated. I would feel the need to stick with blouses that are supposed to be worn over the waistband instead of tucked in.
